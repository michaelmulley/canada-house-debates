The national framework seeks to improve access to treatment and prevention of diabetes through education, consultation with the federal and provincial governments and indigenous groups, clinical practice guidelines and, most importantly, a united approach to ensure better health outcomes for Canadians.</ParaText>

Every day the media reports new shootings that are more horrible than the last, and this weekend was no different. In 2018, shootings reached an all-time high. In 2019, the record was broken again. We know that organized crime is behind most of the shootings and innocent people get caught up in the violence. According to the Toronto chief of police, smuggled guns are the weapons of choice for these criminals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066383">In his intervention, the member alleged that the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> deliberately misled the House in a response to a written question about the costs incurred in legal proceedings related to Canadian Human Rights Tribunal cases. In short, the member argued that there is a discrepancy between the costs specified in the government's response and the amounts provided to members of the public who obtained the information through access to information requests. In his opinion, the government is in contempt of the House for having deliberately misled it by providing incomplete or inaccurate information in its answer to written Question No. 163. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066384">In response, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader asserted that the government uses a consistent formula for calculating litigation costs when responding to written questions, while the methodology used for the compilation of the amounts obtained by other people is unknown. He added that this discrepancy in the information by no means suggests that the calculations by the government were done in bad faith or to deliberately mislead the House, and that this matter should not be considered a legitimate question of privilege since it consisted more in a debate as to the facts. In other words, his view is that members disagree on how the final number was arrived at, but that such disagreements are not unusual in debating an issue from different perspectives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066385">I thank the members for their interventions. Essentially, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252849" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> contends that the response was deliberately misleading because, as he mentioned in his remarks, it does not align with the information obtained by an academic and a journalist through other means, while the parliamentary secretary suggests that the methodologies employed by other sources may have differed from the one employed by the government. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6066395">Mr. Speaker, we are debating a bill today that strips away safeguards from the existing regime for euthanasia and assisted suicide. Debate started yesterday, and I want to continue in the line I was talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066396">Yesterday, I spoke about some of the philosophical problems underlining the government's desire to remove safeguards. Those philosophical ideas are clearly best understood in the realities of life under legal euthanasia and assisted suicide, in the experience of people and families who have been affected by it and in the concerns of people who will be further impacted by the proposed expansion of the practice and removal of safeguards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066397">The fact is that the expectation at the time of the Carter decision was for a legal regime that would apply narrowly. However, we have seen the alarmingly rapid process of expansion at the level of policy and practice continuing with this legislation. Given that this bill comes ahead of a scheduled statutory review, it looks like the pace of expansion of removal of safeguards and enlarging eligibility will continue apace even after this. Rates of identified euthanasia and assisted suicide have gone up dramatically every year since legalization, from about a thousand in 2016 to over five times that in 2019. Those rate increases show no sign of abating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066398">More and more horror stories are coming out about how the current regime has already changed the dynamics of our health care system. My grandmother was a Holocaust survivor, so I know about the long-standing traumatic effects that stay with many survivors for the rest of their lives. One instance of euthanasia at the Louis Brier nursing home in Vancouver, a Jewish facility that has Holocaust survivors among its clientele, was particularly traumatic for residents and staff. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066399">Doctor Ellen Wiebe met with Barry Hyman and his family in the spring of 2018 and determined that he met all the criteria. She later went to the nursing home and closed his door without informing or consulting with nursing home staff. Hyman was killed by Dr. Wiebe on the evening of June 29, without any consultation with his primary caregivers at the nursing home. Perhaps Dr. Wiebe had good intentions, but someone sneaking into a nursing home and then asking us to trust her own notes as evidence of consent raises serious concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066400">Dr. Keselman, CEO of the Louis Brier nursing home, agrees. He said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066401">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Imagine the implications for our staff and our residents and their families. We have a lot of Holocaust survivors. To have a doctor sneak in and kill someone without telling anyone. They’re going to feel like they’re at risk when you learn someone was sneaking in and killing someone.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066402">Clearly Dr. Wiebe, in this case, was pushing the envelope. I doubt most doctors would behave in such a fashion, but we do see from analyses that have taken place in other countries that a small number of activist, pro-euthanasia physicians are overrepresented in cases with problems. A majority of doctors are trying to do the right thing, but a lot of death can flow from the choices of a small number of envelope-pushers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066403">In a paper studying cases of euthanasia in Holland between 2012 and 2016, bioethicists David Miller and Scott Kim of the U.S. National Institutes of Health noted significant problems in the application of these laws for vulnerable people, if the screws were not tightened properly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066404">During that period, Miller and Kim found 33 cases in which doctors had broken at least one rule while killing someone, though apparently none of these justified prosecution. Miller and Kim specifically identified the overrepresentation of certain activist doctors in cases that raised red flags.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066405">I spoke in the House in 2016 about another case in Canada, where a physician declared a depressed person eligible for euthanasia even before examining that person, because the patient “could easily get bed sores and then die of infection”. A person's death was, prior to examination, declared reasonably foreseeable because the person could theoretically die from an as-yet-uncontracted bedsore infection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066406">It is striking that we have these cases to look to at all in Canada, given the massive data collection gaps. There is no requirement for advance legal review to determine if criteria are being met. There are no national standards on tracking data. In fact, in many cases when a patient dies as a result of euthanasia, their death certificate will not even indicate that as the cause of death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066407">People who have had bad experiences cannot tell their stories in most cases. The data that the government refers to is severely constrained by these realities. We tried, during the debate on the last euthanasia bill, to push for mechanisms for better data collection and reporting to ensure evaluation and protection was possible, but at the time unfortunately the government did not listen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066408">Those who have had negative experiences and have lived are understandably reluctant to speak out. However, I want to share one story, with permission, of someone close to me who had a negative interaction with the system after this regime began. This is Taylor's story.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066409">Taylor Hyatt is a twentysomething former member of my staff. She has cerebral palsy. She is vibrant, accomplished and full of life. She went to the hospital a couple of years ago with cold symptoms. She was told that she would probably need some oxygen and was asked if she wanted that. She replied, “Yes, of course”, but then the doctors pressed her on the point by asking if she was sure. Taylor was asked if she was sure she wanted oxygen. She just had pneumonia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066410">When we look at the government's proposal to further expand euthanasia and assisted suicide, and to expand eligibility criteria and remove the small number of safeguards that exist, we need to ask the same question: Is it sure?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066411">As these cases illustrate, we have particular reason to be concerned about cases in which people receive euthanasia or assisted suicide immediately or alone. If multiple family members and health care staff can see, over a period of time, that a person is clear in the desire to have life end, then there is less risk of vulnerability or abuse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066412">Imagine a case, though, in which children visit their mother in hospital on a Monday. It seems like she is having a good day and she makes no mention of wanting to die. She is experiencing some pain, but the nurse says she has promising ideas about how to manage that pain. The nurse says she thinks she needs to adjust the levels of a few things that should settle the pain down, and she will work on that as soon as the doctor has a chance to see her. The children leave on Monday feeling reassured. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066413">Then the children are informed on Wednesday that their mother is dead. They are told that when she met with the doctor, she was in extreme pain and expressed the desire to die, so she was killed right away. They did not get a chance to say goodbye and they do not know if the doctor got it right or wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066414">Perhaps their mother really wanted to die, but maybe she was just experiencing a temporary low point from which she would have recovered. Her children will never know the details or the situation. Because of the absence of witnesses and legal review, there is very little evidence left behind. If their mother really wanted to die, she could, but would it be so unreasonable for the doctor to have given it a few days for the children to have been able to talk to her about her wishes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066415">This particular case is exactly where we should focus our concerns as we look at this legislation. The current legal system requires at least two independent witnesses who are not paid personnel, and there is a 10-day reflection period. I would underline, as members have said and as the government has generally failed to acknowledge, that there is already a mechanism by which the 10-day reflection period can be waived. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066416">However, the 10-day period sets out a rule of general practice that is open to variation. It establishes the general and important principle that people should not have their lives taken as a result of a fleeting sense of hopelessness or because their medication levels are off for a period of time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066417">It makes no sense, as the government is proposing to do, to reduce the number of witnesses and remove the reflection period when there are already provisions for waiving it and managing that effectively in different situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066418">Other members may have had these same experiences. I can tell them I had a close friend dealing with depression a few years ago and his state of mind would fluctuate dramatically from day to day. On certain days, he could not imagine going on, while on other days he would feel, in his words, like himself again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066419">Recognizing the realities of fluctuations and the development of people's experiences, it is horrifying to me that someone could opt for, and receive, euthanasia or assisted suicide within a few hours without independent witnesses or any reflection period. Therefore, the government must remove the clauses of this bill that reduce witnesses and eliminate that reflection period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066420">The government has included a clause in this bill dealing with so-called advance consent. The mechanism is that I, as a patient meeting the criteria, might ask to die on June 1, even if I had lost capacity. My consent right now would suffice for the taking of my life on June 1. However, the legislation contains no requirement that I be asked how I feel on June 1. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066421">Suppose that I am facing a loss of capacity and I am afraid of the implications of that loss of capacity, not knowing what it would be like to mentally regress in the way that doctors have predicted that I will. Suppose that, in light of this fear, I sign on to advance consent but then, on June 1, while I have indeed lost substantial capacity, I actually have a much higher quality of life than I expected to have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066422">Should the advance consent that I have provided, in ignorance of my future circumstances, overrule my feelings in that moment? This is not just idle speculation. </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066427">The government has tried in this legislation to avoid this most extreme case by saying that advanced consent would only apply to a particular date and that the procedure should not proceed if the patient was clearly refusing euthanasia. Unfortunately, the space left for abuse is still massive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066428">In the case just given, suppose the patient was given stronger sedatives so she was completely unaware of what was happening, and therefore offered no resistance. That would be allowed under the framework established by this legislation. It does not require that patients be informed or consulted at the time of their death. If they have provided advanced consent, that is considered sufficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066429">In virtually every case, the requirement for contemporaneous consent is important in our law and is a necessary part of autonomy. If I am to be truly free, then I must be free from the directives of my past self. My past self should not irrevocably be able to bind my future actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066430">Even so, it may be possible to still allow advanced consent, but to have some mechanism through an amendment to ensure that a patient, even with limited capacity, is informed and consulted at the time when his or her life is to be taken. I would encourage the government to consider that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066431">The government should be open to considering these problems and these fixes, taking out sections of the bill that dangerously remove safeguards and strengthening the section on advanced consent to ensure a patient is informed and consulted contemporaneously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066432">Finally, on the point of safeguards, let us go back and reflect on what the purposes of safeguards are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066433"> Some members will feel that meaningful safeguards are not necessary because we should trust medical professionals and patients to get it right. The parliamentary secretary has used general data about trends in this area to suggest that there are no problems with abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066434">Let us be very clear that the reason we have safeguards is not to deal with general cases, but is precisely to deal with exceptional cases. Even if there are not problems in the vast majority of cases, we try to introduce reasonable verification mechanisms, because those verification mechanisms will catch instances of abuse and cases where vulnerable people might be pushed toward a death they do not want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066435">The reason we need law enforcement is not because most people are lawbreakers, but because some people are lawbreakers. The reason we have fire departments and expansive rules and protocols around fire prevention is not because most houses are on fire, but it is because some houses could catch fire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066436">I hope we will see through this debate that the safeguards in the current legal region really are a minimum and that we can provide reasonable safeguards like a short reflection period that can be waived and a requirement for independent witnesses which, like sprinkler systems in this room and security guards watching over us, insulate us against the possibility of something going very wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066437">For the sake of the vulnerable, let us not fire the security and rip the sprinklers out of our system just to make an ideological point.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066438">Mr. Speaker, I want to point out four matters and lower the tone a bit. We need to talk about facts as opposed to emotional arguments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066439">My first point is to clarify that depressed individuals are not subject to this regime. We have specifically included a carve out for mental illness as a sole condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066440">My second point is that the data collection the member seeks is being beefed up by this very bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066441">My third point is that hyperbole has entered into this debate about people being “killed right away”. The notion of having a written consent witnessed by an independent witness and then the eligibility being verified by two independent practitioners, and that occurring in a matter of minutes or hours, is categorically false. That is not the way the system currently operates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066442">My fourth point is that it is an absolute red herring to raise a case based in Holland, which as has advanced directives for ailments such as dementia. We do not have dementia within the penumbra of ailments subject to this regime. We are also not proposing advanced directives; we are proposing advanced consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066443">The member has raised, in some instances, concerns about what he perceives to be patients who are suffering or doctors who are acting aggressively. Those are important cases. If the member has cases, he should have those cases brought to the attention of either disciplinary bodies, regulated physicians or to law enforcement, because those should be enforced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066444">In fact, what we have is evidence to the contrary, that doctors are not practising this overly aggressively. In fact, there is a small of pool of doctors that—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6066445">Mr. Speaker, the member should know that the last legislation included a good faith exception, that a doctor who did not follow all the rules, but still acted in “good faith” would escape prosecution. Cases have been referred to disciplinary bodies, but there is a limited capacity to actually prosecute people who are, in the case, described as going into a nursing home and taking someone's life, without any consultation with the surrounding staff. These cases raise significant concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066446">The member says that we should lower the tone and avoid hyperbole and then criticizes me for bringing up specific cases in Canada and in other countries that have similar legal regimes. The government should look at these cases and consider them before moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066447"> It is right to bring up the Dutch case, and I acknowledge the differences in the proposed regime in Canada from the Dutch regime. However, I pointed out very specifically that there was no requirement in the existing legislation for the person to be asked in the moment. I would beg the government to introduce that additional requirement for some contemporaneous consultation with the patients. After all, what does it have to lose? There very much is the possibility of someone being killed right away under the proposed legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066448">If the parliamentary secretary is so opposed to that characterization of the legislation, then why not leave in some waiting period?

They seemed to suggest that health professionals are malicious rather than benevolent, but that is not true. I heard the member talk about doctors sneaking into care facilities to kill people. That seems a bit far-fetched to me. If something that terrible really happened, I hope my colleagues brought it to the attention of the appropriate authorities.</ParaText>

I agree that the vast majority of health care practitioners are not only well-intentioned, but also are not trying to push the envelope in any way. However, the data I cited suggests that in other jurisdictions we have seen how a relatively large number of problematic cases can emerge from the actions of perhaps also well-intentioned but definitely envelope-pushing physicians, who go beyond the intention of the legislature with respect to this bill. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066462">Mr. Speaker, I need some clarification from my colleague. He finished his speech by talking about final consent. The act currently requires final consent at the time people are assessed and then they have to give final consent when that order proceeds. This has forced patients to make a cruel choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066463"> Once patients are assessed as being eligible for medical assistance in dying, they have to decide if they should do it right away, while they have the competence and can give an answer, or if they set a date in the future to allow themselves and their families to do all the things they want to do, but then risk that they are not competent and cannot answer and the procedure would not go ahead. I have a friend having to make that cruel decision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066465">Mr. Speaker, I have two points in response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066466"> In the context of advance consent, it is important to note that people do not know precisely what their experience will be. They may get a prognosis and think they will feel a certain way about things at that point in time. It is important to underline that the reason we generally do not have advanced consent is because people do not always know what their experience of that will be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066467">Nonetheless, I want to be very clear. What I would propose as a middle way between having no advanced consent and the advanced consent regime proposed in the legislation is to allow people to give advanced consent, but to still require, even at the point at which they may have lost capacity, some contemporaneous consultation with them, so even at a point of reduced capacity they are told what is happening and will be given the opportunity to assent or not. Even at the point at which they have lost capacity, it is still fair to them to give them some information about what is happening in order to give them the ability to express their objection, if they are able to in the context of limited capacity.</ParaText>

The courts have ruled that it is a violation of our charter rights as Canadians not to have access to medical assistance in dying. I know it is a very difficult and fraught topic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066469">I would ask the member this quite directly, not to a hypothetical. Thinking of Audrey Parker of Nova Scotia, who knew she was terminally ill and who choose to end her life earlier because she was denied an advanced directive, would he agree that these sets of amendments to the Criminal Code are fair and within the context of what the courts have directed us to do?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066470">Mr. Speaker, there have been various court decisions dealing with this broader topic, but I am not aware of court decisions dealing specifically with the issue of advanced consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066471"> Clearly the case of Ms. Audrey Parker should evoke a thoughtful response from us. I am not aware of all the medical details of the case. Many people have opinions about the case who also may not be aware of all the details, or the context or the information she received. Therefore, I do not feel comfortable giving an answer in the House of Commons about what should or should not happen in a particular individual's case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066472">We can, as members of Parliament, try to work together to find consensus, or to have our cake and eat it too, to use the expression. If it is the will of the majority, we can have some mechanism of advanced consent, but still require contemporaneous consent at the point at which somebody's life will be taken. That is very important. We would not want a situation where some people have their lives taken while they are unaware they are being taken or do not want it to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066473">I will just tease the member a little by pointing out that there was a court of appeal decision in Alberta opposing the carbon tax, and I hope she shares my enthusiasm for court decisions in that case as well.

              <ParaText id="6066475">The proposed measures respond to the Superior Court of Quebec's Truchon decision, in which it ruled that it is unconstitutional to deny access to medical assistance in dying to individuals who meet all the other eligibility criteria but are not near the end of life.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066476">In responding to this ruling, the Government of Canada has had the opportunity to consider some additional measures for which there is strong support. That is why we are proposing changes that will help clarify and add precision to Canada's medical assistance in dying legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066477">Over the past few months, I have had the honour of listening to many Canadians, and it was important for me as the Minister of Health to hear first-hand what they had to say. My colleagues and I hosted a series of round tables and heard from more than 125 experts, academics, ethicists, doctors, nurse practitioners, members of the disability community, indigenous groups and key stakeholders. I also engaged my provincial and territorial colleagues, and my officials worked closely with their counterparts across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066478"> In January, I was in Calgary and spoke to Cynthia Clark, who saw her husband through the process of medically assisted death last summer. Her perspective, as well as those of so many others with first-hand experience were invaluable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066479">I also listened to practitioners who have been providing medical assistance in death in a very thoughtful, compassionate way over the last four years. They had a lot to say about what was working well but also about what was not working well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066480">We heard many personal stories like Cynthia's, and they helped shape the changes that we are proposing today. In addition, the feedback received from our online consultation was astounding. In two weeks we had more than 300,000 responses.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066481">It is clear that certain aspects could be improved in order to facilitate access, protect the vulnerable and respect personal choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066482">With this bill, I think we have achieved a balanced approach that reflects the best interests of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066483">Protecting the safety of vulnerable people while respecting the autonomy of Canadians remains our central objective. That is why the bill proposes a two-track approach to safeguards, based on whether or not a person's death is reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066484">Reasonable foreseeability of natural death would no longer be a requirement for determining whether a person can access medical assistance in dying. It would, however, be used to guide practitioners in determining which safeguards to apply. This is consistent with what we heard at the round table meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066485">Providers involved in assessing the eligibility of applicants for a medically assisted death told us they have a good understanding of the concept and are comfortable applying it. Under the amended law, they would use reasonable foreseeability of natural death to determine not eligibility, but rather which safeguards would apply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066486">For those whose death is reasonably foreseeable, we would ease some of the pre-existing safeguards. Under the current system, there is a requirement for a 10-day reflection period. We are proposing to eliminate this reflection period. For those who are at the end of their life, the decision to request medical assistance in dying is well considered, and this additional period only serves to prolong suffering unnecessarily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066487">The current system also requires that two independent witnesses confirm that the person who has signed a request for medical assistance in dying is who they claim to be and that no fraud has occurred, such as the forging of someone's signature. During our consultations, we heard that this requirement was a significant barrier for many people at the end of their life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066488">We propose requiring only one witness and allowing this witness to be a paid personal or health care provider. These individuals naturally would be excluded from acting as a witness if they are a beneficiary of the person's will or if they would receive a financial or material benefit from the person's death. Anyone involved in assessing or providing medical assistance in dying would continue to be ineligible to serve as a witness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066489">For those whose death is not reasonably foreseeable, we would create a new, more robust set of safeguards. We think it is important, even while improving access, to ensure that people who are suffering but who are not dying are given full and careful consideration as they assess whether or not to pursue an assisted death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066490">Strengthened safeguards would also serve to protect vulnerable individuals. For example, the bill proposes a minimum period of 90 days for assessing a MAID request in the case of a non-imminent death. This period would allow for exploration, discussion and consideration of options to alleviate suffering by the person seeking medical assistance in dying and with the practitioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066491">The bill would also require that the person requesting MAID be provided with information on available counselling, mental health supports, disability supports and palliative care as part of the informed consent process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066492">We know that the majority of practitioners are already ensuring that their patients are aware of all of the supports and options that are available to them. This provision underscores the importance of the doctor-patient relationship. It allows for a practitioner and a patient to decide whether medical assistance in dying is the right step and provides sufficient time for the patient to discuss and consider other treatment options, which is crucial for patients weighing this kind of decision. This provision supports fully informed decision-making and individual autonomy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066493">Under the current legislation, those who become incapacitated lose their eligibility for medical assistance in dying because the person must give their consent immediately before the procedure. This means that some individuals deemed eligible for medical assistance in dying have chosen to end their lives earlier than they wanted out of fear of losing the opportunity to receive this service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066494">That is why we are proposing to include a waiver of final consent for persons whose death is reasonably foreseeable and who have been assessed and approved to receive medical assistance in dying. Individuals at the end of their life who risk losing their decision-making capacity before their chosen date would have an avenue to receive MAID without worrying that loss of their decision-making capacity before their chosen date would disqualify them. Support for this amendment is strong among stakeholders, Canadians and health practitioners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066495">Canada has had four years to reflect on the current MAID legislation passed in June 2016, and there are many complex issues that require further study. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066496">In December of 2016, the Government of Canada asked the Council of Canadian Academies to conduct independent reviews on three specific types of requests for medical assistance in dying that are currently outside of the scope of the law: requests by mature minors, advance requests and requests where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066497">The Council of Canadian Academies convened a multidisciplinary panel of 43 experts to review an extensive body of evidence, including Canadian and international academic and policy research.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066498">We tabled those reports in Parliament in December 2018. They provide us with a thorough, thoughtful examination of these very difficult subjects. I encourage all members to read those reports as we continue our deliberations on the proposed legislative amendments and the parliamentary review that will be conducted later this year.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066499">There is agreement among experts that allowing advance requests for people with illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease well before they would otherwise be deemed eligible is very complex and will require careful consideration and consultation before it could be included in legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066500">During the round tables I heard directly from health care providers who expressed discomfort because they have seen patients who, as their position progressed, might not have the same desire for medical assistance in dying as when they were first diagnosed. The Council of Canadian Academies' expert panel report on advance requests came to the same conclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066501">At the same time, we know that many Canadians have expressed an interest in advance requests so that they could have the comfort of knowing that they could avoid extreme suffering at some future date. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066502">For all these reasons, we believe this issue deserves deeper examination through parliamentary review. That will be our opportunity to tackle questions that are profound and difficult to answer, even for practitioners who have been providing this service over the past four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066503">The proposed changes to the medical assistance in dying legislation would exclude persons if mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066504">This does not mean that people with mental illness are ineligible; it means that mental illness cannot be the sole underlying condition. This is another complex aspect that warrants a more thorough discussion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066505">Since the federal legislation came into force in 2016, Health Canada has released four federal interim reports that provide more information on how the legislation is being implemented across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066506">In November 2018, we implemented regulations that resulted in the creation of a permanent monitoring regime that sets out obligations for reporting on medical assistance in dying cases by doctors, nurse practitioners and pharmacists. The first monitoring report under these regulations is expected to be released in spring 2020 .</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066507">Since MAID legislation was enacted in 2016, more than 13,000 Canadians have chosen this option of a medically assisted death. This is not unexpected. We have seen a gradual increase in the numbers over the last three years. The number of MAID deaths in Canada, slightly under 2% of all deaths, is in line with international regimes. The increasing use of MAID is largely a result of enhanced awareness of it as a legal option and greater acceptance by Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066508">The federal government recognizes that public reporting is critical to ensuring transparency and also to ensuring public trust in the legislation. That is why we are proposing changes to expand data collection to help provide a more complete picture of medical assistance in dying in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066509">Under the current legislation, only practitioners who receive a written request for MAID and pharmacists who dispense a MAID substance are required to provide information, but it has become clear that capturing information based solely on written requests for MAID received by physicians and nurse practitioners has resulted in an incomplete picture on who is requesting MAID across the country, and why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066510">The amended legislation would authorize new regulations to be developed in partnership with provinces and territories to allow for the collection of data on all assessments for MAID, and this would include those undertaken by other health professionals on the care team. It also clearly aligns with the original intent of the legislation to collect information on all requests for, and cases of, MAID in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066511">I think we can agree that Canadians with life-limiting illnesses deserve the best quality of life possible as they approach the end of their lives. Palliative care and end-of-life care provide patients with relief from the pain and distress associated with a life-threatening illness. Supporting home care and palliative care is a key priority in our ongoing efforts to improve our health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066512">Through budget 2017, we made historic new investments in health care to improve access to mental health and addiction services, as well as home and community care, including palliative care. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066520">Mr. Speaker, the minister said Canadians who are deciding whether they wish to receive medical assistance in dying are often experiencing prolonged suffering. The problem is that their prolonged suffering is due to a lack of palliative care. We were promised $3 billion would go to palliative care. Our dear member Mark Warawa spent nine days in hospital before he even saw a palliative care doctor.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066531">In the case of conditions such as Alzheimer's, where people have to anticipate how they might feel if they have a condition, it is much harder to do those assessments. We heard this from practitioners who work very closely with patients in all kinds of situations. They said that when people anticipate how they might feel when suffering from a particular condition, they can be dramatically wrong. When people arrive there, they do not have the kinds of feelings they might think they have when they have, for example, a traumatic injury.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066535">I understand we had to put this legislation in place, but I am still concerned. The Parliament of Canada voted on a national palliative care strategy to work with the provinces and territories and put in place the opportunity for people to truly die with dignity next to their families in a much more healing and holistic manner, yet we have only heard a lot of talk about that and only as an addendum to the conversation about assisted dying.

That is because we still do not know enough about how a desire to receive medical assistance in dying might interact with a mental illness. This in no way negates the suffering felt by people who are struggling with mental illness. I have personally worked with people who have severe mental illness and I fully understand that their suffering can be immense.

              <ParaText id="6066554"> I am going to confine my comments to issues I have with the bill, things I am concerned about, and my genuine belief that the government will take a very collaborative approach to this legislation. If we take a collaborative approach to this legislation, Canadians will have trust and faith that we developed legislation to actually address their needs and protect their concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066555">Speaking of concerns, I have a number of them. I will start off by talking about what I consider to be a significant lack of consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066556">This legislation will come up for review in June. It is the five-year mandated review of the legislation. My understanding is that the government has applied for a four-month extension with respect to the implementation of this legislation, which the Quebec court struck down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066557">If we have this four-month extension and have the mandated review of the legislation scheduled in June, what is the rush? Why have we rushed to introduce legislation prior to that mandatory review, which would, of course, be extensive and broad and far more in depth than any consultation that has been done with respect to the current legislation? My understanding is that there was only about two weeks of public consultation for this legislation. In my opinion, that is woefully deficient given the gravity of the topic we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066558">This is my first real concern. What is the hurry? What is the rush? The court has given us more time to do this, and I believe we should be taking the time to go through the mandatory review and consult with Canadians, and then decide on the path forward. That is my number one concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066559">I want to mention that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252945" Type="2">Langley—Aldergrove</Affiliation>. My thanks to the page for bringing that to my attention. She is doing an excellent job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066560">The next thing I want to talk about is palliative care. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has made comments in the House today espousing the great investments that are being made by the government in health care, but has not really talked about any specific investments with respect to palliative care. I think that is a critical thing to look at when we discuss this legislation. I want to remind the minister that Bill <Document DbId="8286156" Type="4">C-277</Document>, an act providing for the development of a framework on palliative care in Canada, was passed in the previous Parliament in 2017, and clearly states in the preamble:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066561">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Whereas the Final Report stated that a request for physician-assisted death cannot be truly voluntary if the option of proper palliative care is not available to alleviate a person’s suffering;</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066562">This was passed by Parliament, so if we are looking to expand the scope of medically assisted death without also expanding the availability of palliative care, we are doing an incredible disservice to Canadians, because the availability of palliative care in this country is poor at best. I am going to speak about this personally just for a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066563">Both of my parents suffered from terminal cancer. My mother was not able to get into a palliative care facility because there was no palliative care facility available for her, so she passed away in the hospital. My father was also not able to get into palliative care, but fortunately his illness was longer than my mother's, or unfortunately, depending on how one looks at it, and we were able to get private home care that eased his suffering and made sure he was being taken care of. However, there was no way that he was going to be able to get into palliative care within the scope of his illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066564">This is affecting Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the minister has rushed to introduce this bill. Why would the minister not have introduced corollary legislation, or legislation in tandem, or announced increases in funding for palliative care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066565">In my riding of Dufferin—Caledon, there is a fantastic hospice for palliative care. It is called Bethell Hospice. It only has approximately 15 beds. That is the palliative care option in my riding. For approximately 200,000 people, there are 15 palliative care beds. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066566">Members can imagine that there is a significant number of people who are not able to get into palliative care. Therefore, the option of medically assisted death becomes far more attractive for someone who is not able to enter into a palliative care facility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066567">I will repeat that it is clearly a violation of legislation that was passed by the House. When people do not have the option for proper palliative care, their consent for a medically assisted death is significantly in question. I am extraordinarily concerned by the lack of any plan by the government to deal with investments in palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066568">The minister has suggested that there are significant safeguards in place for people who suffer from any type of mental illness. However, I am not sure what those safeguards are. She suggested that just having that condition would exclude someone from obtaining a medically assisted death. What is the definition of that? How are we proving that is the only issue?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066569"> There is no requirement for individuals to go to a psychiatrist in order to assess that they are not suffering from a severe bout of depression. In my own life, I have gone through extraordinary stages and phases of depression during which I actually did not want to live anymore. I was not seeing a psychiatrist at the time. Would I have then been able to avail myself of these services while I was in a period of particular darkness? We know that mental health is an issue that is rampant throughout this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066570">Again, I will go back to my first point, which is: Why are we rushing to do this? Why are we not taking the time to go through the five-year review? We need to take the time to find ways to make sure we are safeguarding all Canadians in providing them the option of medically assisted death, if they want it, but also ensuring that people who are choosing this, maybe because of a lack of palliative care, or maybe because of underlying mental health issues, are going to be protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066571">These are some of the major concerns I have with respect to this piece of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066572">Going back to the consultation, two weeks for online submissions with respect to concerns by Canadians is not anywhere near a sufficient amount of consultation. My understanding is that it was mostly online submissions. This is not a way to get the pulse of Canadians with respect to a very significant issue that is going on in this country. I will continue to ask why there was not a longer or broader consultation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066573">I know this matter will be studied at committee, but having been a member of Parliament now for going on five and a half years, I understand the extreme limitations at committee. We will often have a panel of six witnesses. Those six witnesses will each get their 10-minute statement, and then members of Parliament might get a six-minute intervention to try and raise an issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066574">If one is going to suggest that a committee study will be far broader in scope, or somewhat more encompassing than the mandatory statutory five-year review, I will respectfully disagree with that submission. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066575">Committees absolutely do great work, but they also suffer from an extreme pressure of legislation and time. To suggest that one or two weeks or three meetings at committee is sufficient time to analyze, debate and discuss this legislation, I do not think that is the correct answer. We should be putting this legislation off until we have the mandatory five-year review in June, which would allow us to have a far more expansive discussion with respect to all of the issues that are being discussed in the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066576">These are my comments and concerns with respect to the legislation. I certainly hope the government will listen to these concerns, act collaboratively and co-operatively, and not try to drive this legislation through without listening to legitimate concerns that are being raised by members of the opposition. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066578">During the debates in the last session there was a great deal of emotion that was expressed, and I valued and appreciated the contributions by members. I think members from all sides of the House were really trying to get a better understanding of the important subject matter that we were debating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066579">The member is quite right when it comes to palliative care. Whether it is the national government or the provincial governments who ultimately administer health care, we need to do a much better job on palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066580"> I wonder if my friend from across the way can provide some additional thoughts. I would ask him to look specifically at areas of the country where palliative care is nowhere near where it should or could be compared to other areas of the country. I am thinking of rural versus urban and even variations between urban centres.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066581">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the point being raised. Yes, access to palliative care across this country is a huge issue. In fact, we are making the situation worse with the government deciding to take away funding from palliative care centres that do not offer medically assisted death as part of the suite of services that they offer. We are losing palliative care beds across the country as a result of that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066582"> I am hopeful that the members hearing this topic being raised by members of the opposition will take it back and look at reversing it. The last thing we need in this country is fewer palliative care beds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066583">I would encourage the member to speak to his leader and to cabinet and get them working on a national palliative care strategy and investing money to ensure we have equal access to palliative care across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066585">A psychiatrist must absolutely conduct a mental health assessment of the person who is dying or suffering. Family doctors are able to prescribe antidepressants to treat depression. Sometimes, a doctor may have to tell a patient that there are no further treatments available and then refer that patient to palliative care to ease their suffering. If the patient immediately says that they want to access MAID, the doctor will prescribe antidepressants, because there are steps to go through long before a patient can access MAID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066586">I have a hard time understanding the problem my Conservative colleague sees, since the bill excludes mental illness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066587">Everyone thinks that pain relief in palliative care is common practice, regardless of whether the patient is receiving care. This is called a good medical practice. Relief is provided for pain. No terminal patient receiving good care that manages pain is forced to ask for medical assistance in dying. Patients who request it do so by choice. This choice is necessary, and for there to be a choice, there need to be options.</ParaText>

My family doctor and most family doctors are completely incapable of treating someone for depression. Yes, they might be able to prescribe a medication, but medication is not the answer to all depression. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066598">I am speaking to Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, a bill that would eliminate the reasonable death forseeability safeguard and expand MAID, medical assistance in dying, to a larger number of people.

              <ParaText id="6066600">Correspondence that I am receiving from constituents repeat two basic themes. First is that the reasonable forseeability of death safeguard should be maintained as an effective defence of societal interests and Canadian values. Second is that more should be done to expand palliative care services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066601">To quote one person, let Canada be a society that is known for its modern and advanced palliative care services and not as a country that has ever expanding use of medical assistance in dying.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> If Canada must allow MAiD in some form (and I wish it didn't), it is incumbent upon us to ensure that it is rare.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066605">The second is a woman named Ramona. She works in health care, including palliative care. She quotes a person to whose care she attended, and who died in the Langley Hospice facility, as saying, “I want to live well while I'm dying.” Ramona goes on to comment, “Surely this is what health care was created for, to support people while they are alive, not to speed up their death.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066606">This is the tenor of the input I am receiving from my constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066607">Behind Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> is the Superior Court decision in Truchon. The plaintiffs in that case argued that their constitutional rights had been infringed upon by the now amended section 241 of the Criminal Code. They argued that the Carter decision, on which Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was based, did not require that a person's end of life be reasonably foreseeable, and that is a true statement. That is not what the Carter decision required.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066608">Secondly, they argued that the legislated end of life requirement violated the right to equality, under section 15 of the charter, and the right to life, liberty and security of the person, under section 7 of the charter. The federal government, acting through the Attorney General's office, did the right thing at that time. It defended its law. That is what the Attorney General should do. Bill C-14 was the well-considered opinion of the previous Parliament. It was the law. The Attorney General must defend the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066609">Remarkably, the Quebec Superior Court refused to accept the arguments advanced by the Attorney General. The Quebec Superior Court said that the court cannot accept the first two objectives advanced by the Attorney General regarding the affirmation of the inherent and equal value of every person's life and the importance of preventing suicide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066610">In the opinion of the justice writing that decision, those two principles were not the underlying philosophy of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. It was all about protecting vulnerable persons from being induced, in moments of weakness, to end their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066611">Remarkably, the Attorney General of Canada did not appeal that decision. That is what should have been done. Any self-respecting Attorney General would appeal a decision that attacked the laws of Parliament. This Attorney General elected not to do that. Now we are in this position where we are under pressure to amend the law, when we should instead be following the directive of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, and that is to have a comprehensive review of the whole legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066612">That is what we should be doing. What is the rush? The rush is caused by the Attorney General's failure to appeal this decision. It should have been tested through the court system, up to the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066613">With the reasonable foreseeability of death safeguard down, this is what we have left. An applicant for MAID qualifies if he or she has a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability; is in an advanced state of decline; or their physical or psychological suffering is intolerable to them, which is a completely subjective test. The reasonable foreseeability of death criteria is now gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066614">Let us just test this against a couple of hypothetical situations. We can imagine that a person has Parkinson's or MS, or was in a terrible accident and is a paraplegic. Under this new regime, if it becomes the law, people who are not dying but who meet all the other criteria, however subjective they may be, will qualify for state-sanctioned suicide. One of my constituents has said that we should let Canada be a society that is known for its modern and advanced palliative care services, and not as a country that has ever-expanding use of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066629">In all cases, at least one of the physicians consulting should actually have some particular expertise about the ailment. Physicians deal with a wide variety of things, so the person who knows particularly well the disease should be involved in the consultation. To me, that seems very reasonable, and I wonder what the member thinks of that. I hope the government might be willing to apply this safeguard not just in one of the two streams, but across the board.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066633">In developing these amendments, Canadians were widely consulted in January 2020. During these consultations, approximately 300,000 Canadians completed an online questionnaire. In addition, the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> met with stakeholders in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa and Quebec City to discuss proposed revisions to Canada's medical assistance in dying framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066634">These experts and stakeholders included doctors, nurses, legal experts, national indigenous organizations and representatives of the disability community. The high level of participation in both the questionnaire and the in-person sessions is a reflection of the importance of this issue to Canadians. Moreover, the results of the consultations were critically important in shaping the government's approach to medically assisted dying as it evolves to reflect the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066635">This bill would amend the Criminal Code to allow medical assistance in dying for people who wish to relieve their suffering through a medically assisted death, whether their natural death is reasonably foreseeable or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066636">This bill would remove the reasonable foreseeability of natural death from the list of eligibility criteria. It would also expressly exclude people seeking medical assistance in dying solely because of mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066637">The bill proposes a two-track approach based on whether a person's natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Existing safeguards remain and are eased for those whose death is reasonably foreseeable. In addition, new and modified safeguards would be applied to eligible persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066638">In the spirit of “nothing without us”, I would like to mention the government remains focused on addressing the concerns of the disability community around vulnerability and choice. The proposed changes to the legislation support greater autonomy and freedom of choice for eligible persons who wish to relieve their suffering by pursuing a medically assisted death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066639">At the same time, full consideration has been given to the protection of vulnerable persons and to respecting the equality rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. In short, this bill would maintain and strengthen safeguards to support fully informed decision-making, while also respecting individual autonomy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066640">In terms of advance consent, many participants were comfortable with implementing advance requests for those who have been assessed and approved for medically assisted dying, but are concerned about losing capacity before it is provided. This bill would allow people who risk losing decision-making capacity to make arrangements with their practitioner to receive medically assisted dying on their chosen date, even if they lose decision-making capacity before that date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066641">The bill would also make advance consent invalid if the person demonstrates refusal or resistance to the administration of medically assisted dying. The bill goes on to clarify that reflexes and other types of involuntary movements, such as response to touch or the insertion of a needle, would not constitute refusal or resistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066642">In addition, the bill would allow eligible persons who choose to self-administer to provide advance consent for a physician to administer a substance to cause their death if self-administration fails and causes them to lose capacity. This type of advance consent would be available for all eligible persons, regardless of their prognosis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066643">I would like to take a moment to speak to the progress the government has made with respect to the rights of persons with disabilities in Canada. In fact, last year, the government enacted the Accessible Canada Act, which aims to create a barrier-free Canada through the proactive identification, removal and prevention of barriers to accessibility wherever Canadians interact with areas under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066644">The act is one of the most significant advances in disability rights since the charter in 1982 and is designed to inspire a cultural transformation for disability inclusion and accessibility in Canada. The act created Accessibility Standards Canada, a new organization that will create and revise accessibility standards, and support and promote innovative accessibility research. The CEO and board of directors were appointed and operations began last summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066645"> That act also established National AccessAbility Week, a week dedicated to accessibility in late May and early June each year. National AccessAbility Week is an opportunity to promote inclusion and accessibility in communities and workplaces, and to celebrate the contributions of Canadians with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066646">It is also a time to recognize the efforts of individuals, communities and workplaces that are actively removing barriers to give Canadians of all abilities a better chance to succeed. The act applies to federally regulated organizations for now, but we know the culture shift will have a trickle-down effect, and that awareness and action on disability inclusion will increase across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066647">Our government is taking real action to address the rights of persons with disabilities. The careful writing of Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> is a testament to that. Representatives of disability organizations and leading disability scholars participated in consultations across the country. Their input informed the reforms proposed in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066648">We recognize that disability inclusion requires more than legislation. That is why we are continuing to work with the disability community and other stakeholders to address stigma and bias. It is important to bring about a culture change to ensure that the important contributions made to Canada by persons with disabilities are recognized and valued on the same basis as those of other Canadians. Going forward, we will continue to focus on improving the social and economic inclusion of persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066649">We will continue to work hard to ensure that all people are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, especially when it comes to deep and personal issues like ending life. It is imperative that the voices of all Canadians, including Canadians with disabilities, continue to be heard on the issue of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066662">Mr. Speaker, we have a unique opportunity to fix our assisted dying laws and to protect the individual right of all Canadians to make such a fundamental and deeply personal choice for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066663">I opposed the assisted dying laws in the last Parliament because they were too restrictive. They were not in keeping with the Supreme Court's decision in Carter and I believed them to be unconstitutional, and here we are. A Quebec court found the law to be unconstitutional and we agreed, rightly, to abide by that decision. We have another chance to get it right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066664">As we look forward to what getting it right looks like, we should also look behind us at the Supreme Court's decision in Carter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066665">Those in the House have talked about striking a balance between the fundamental freedom of individuals to choose for themselves and the autonomy of the individual to make such a deeply personal choice, and protecting vulnerable persons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066666">For people who read the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, they will know that the Supreme Court struck that balance with a number of safeguards that look like this: to be eligible for assisted dying, one needs to be suffering intolerably and in an enduring way; one needs to be in a grievous and irremediable condition, an incurable illness; and the individual in question needs to be competent and to clearly consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066667">The government in the last Parliament incorrectly, in my view, added an additional criterion for eligibility that one's death needed to be reasonably foreseeable. That is unnecessarily and unduly restrictive. I will get to a court case in particular that explains this in greater detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066668">There are two core injustices that the new law proposes to fix. First, the question of removing the “reasonably foreseeable” requirement as a matter of eligibility, and also addressing the case of Audrey Parker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066669">We had another fundamental injustice where an individual who was eligible for MAID took her life earlier than she otherwise would have, lost time in her life that she otherwise would have spent with her family and loved ones. She was worried about losing competence and being unable to give consent near the very end, despite the fact that was exactly what she wanted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066670">The Council of Canadian Academies identified three levels of advance request: where an individual is already eligible for MAID, such as in the Audrey Parker case; where an individual has been diagnosed and is not yet eligible, but is on the path towards eligibility; and where someone has not yet been diagnosed, so is farther from eligibility for MAID. In this case we have identified a solution to one of those categories, but we ought to solve advance requests more broadly going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066671">Is the law perfect? No, but it is worthy of our support at second reading. However, there are a number of concerns worth highlighting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066672">First, while a reasonably foreseeable death is no longer a criterion of eligibility, there are additional hurdles for individuals to pass if their death is not within the near future. One of two practitioners assessing eligibility must have expertise in the condition. Although that sounds very reasonable in theory, my only question for committee members as they look at this is to ensure that is not an impossible barrier in practice, particularly for those in rural communities where such expertise may not exist at all times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066673">There is also a minimum, and I would say somewhat arbitrary, period of 90 days for the assessment of the request. It looks like a backdoor cooling-off period. It would make far more sense for us to have no time limit and the assessment to be done in the ordinary course, or at least a much shorter time period, because we are talking about people who are suffering incredibly and are competent to make the decision for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066674">Does it cure the case for Audrey Parker? I think largely it does, but I worry if the main procedure must be scheduled already, what does that mean? If Audrey Parker was in a situation to say, “I am not exactly sure what the time period will be. I know it is not now but I know it will be soon”, is she to have scheduled a particular date, which would make her eligible for the advance request, or are we going to put people in a situation where they are scheduling something earlier than they otherwise would?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066675">Mental health is a real challenge because we are building an additional criterion into this legislation that says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066702"> It is much harder when a person is not diagnosed at all. I am 35. Would I put an advance request in right now? How could that be intelligible? How could we make sense of that? There are two things to say to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066703"> I mentioned sunset clauses. If we are requiring certainty, individuals would have to revisit their advance requests and uphold those requests. There has to be a window of time when it would then fall away and not be legally valid. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066704">The other thing to note is that the Supreme Court's criteria are also pretty key here. I cannot just say an advance request for anything of which I am eligible to die. I still have to be in a condition that is an incurable illness and where there is grievous, intolerable and enduring suffering. These are incredibly important safeguards to keep in mind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066710">I am very happy to be taking part in this debate, which is a departure from our usual political and often partisan work as elected officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066711">This is the third time in my parliamentary career that I have been asked to debate and vote on the issue of medical assistance in dying. I was a member of Quebec's National Assembly for seven years, and I have served here in the House of Commons since 2015 with the support of my constituents.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066712">I was elected to the national assembly in 2008. As a member of that assembly, I participated in the first debate we had in Quebec on this issue, the first time in a Canadian legislature, in 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066713">I also was a participant in the debate we had four years ago in the House of Commons, when, for first time, we addressed the issue. Therefore, in my parliamentary life, this is the third time I will participate and vote on this very touchy, personal and non-partisan issue.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066714">That is why I would like to remind the House of certain cardinal rules that should guide our actions as parliamentarians in this debate, which we believe should be totally non-partisan. Things may get tense at times, but debate must remain respectful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066715">Respecting the free vote should be one of the cardinal rules of this debate. In my view, there is no right or wrong position in this debate. There are only positions that we are comfortable with as human beings. Whether we are for or against, there is no partisan politics behind it. There is only the personal opinion that we hold, share and analyze. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066716">Consequently, it is important to keep a completely open mind and respect the fact that certain colleagues from our own party may not share our point of view, while colleagues from other parties may. That is fine. There is nothing wrong with that, really. Some positions we adopt, and some positions we cannot be comfortable with. That is all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066717">We must respect the debate. We must respect personal opinions. We must respect the fact that there is no place for partisanship in this debate and that positions are neither right nor wrong. There are positions that we can agree with and others that we cannot. We must respect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066718">There are also certain elements that we must bear in mind before we dive into this. In our opinion, the bill has some shortcomings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066719">First, we must respect the freedom of conscience of physicians who are called on to provide MAID. If a physician feels that they cannot in good conscience provide MAID, they should be able to say so and not have to proceed. I have spoken to many people in the context of this debate, in which I have been participating for a very long time. Everyone I have spoken to has told me that physicians can show a certain openness in some circumstances, but change their minds in others. Physicians should never be forced to act against their conscience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066720">Furthermore, we should always bear in mind that MAID, by its very nature, is the last level of health care that can be offered. We must never forget that the role of palliative care is to ensure that those who are ill can live with dignity even in tragic circumstances. Therefore, we must respect physicians' conscience and focus on palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066721">Taking our time is another cardinal rule that must be respected in this type of debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066722">Let me remind members that the first time this issue was addressed in Quebec, it took six full years, three different governments and three different premiers. There was a huge debate about it, a strong and wise debate. Each and every position had been clearly established by those people who participated in the debate. There is no rush. We must take our time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066723">For some people, we are talking about assisted suicide. It is a very touchy issue. The worst-case scenario is to rush it. Quebec spent six full years, and we should follow this example. It obviously will not take six years this time, but the first step took six full years.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066724">Let's agree that this debate cannot be rushed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066725">Why are we debating Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> today?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066726">When the House of Commons adopted Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in 2016, I was a member of the committee that studied it. We knew then that Canadians would challenge parts of it and that there would be court rulings. That is exactly what happened on September 11, 2019, when the Quebec Superior Court struck down the notion of “reasonably foreseeable natural death” in the bill that became An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to make related amendments to other Acts regarding medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066727">I did not know this before I looked it up, but it is interesting to note that the current Minister of Justice, a man for whom I have tremendous respect and esteem owing to his experience as a lawyer and a McGill University professor, voted against Bill C-14. Now, as Minister of Justice, he is sponsoring this bill as the federal government's response to the Quebec Superior Court's ruling. The bill addresses some of the issues but sets others aside. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066728"> The first fundamental element of Bill C-7 is that it eliminates the 10-day waiting period that the current law requires as a buffer between the person's decision and the operation itself, to ensure that the second opinion provided for under the act is in fact obtained. The court deemed this provision invalid, and the minister decided to accept that opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066729">Let's also not forget that the current law, which was passed four years ago, requires the provisions to be reviewed in just a few months, starting in June 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066730">The government decided to take note of the Superior Court of Quebec ruling and act accordingly. That is its right. However, regardless of our views on the issue, we feel that this subject involves some truly fundamental questions and raises highly complex legal concerns. We think this ruling should have been appealed to the highest court in the land, so that the nine justices of the Supreme Court could study every possible ramification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066731">This bill sidesteps the issue of mental illness entirely. That is a very good thing, because in our view, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the instant when a mental illness becomes irreversible, which can raise doubts about whether consent was given fully and freely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066732">As I said earlier, the worst thing we could do in this matter is move too fast. There is no rush. This concern may eventually be debated, but for now, let's take it one step at a time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066733">Since my time is almost up, I would just like to say that in this debate on such a delicate, sensitive issue, the worst thing we could do is plough full steam ahead and attack people's convictions instead of respecting their choices. Let's take the time to do things right on this extremely delicate and extremely important issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066751">Madam Speaker, Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code in relation to medical assistance in dying, is one that I believe was written with the intention of providing compassion to those who are suffering through an unfathomable, unbearable degree of pain by allowing a lawful, expedited termination of their suffering and granting access to a dignified death. The intention is kind. I see an urgency from the government to extend this expression of compassion to those who are suffering beyond comprehension. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066752">However, from the perspective of a visionary and a lawmaker who cares for the long-term wellness and prosperity of our country, I would like to invite all members of the House to pause and bring into our dialogue the long-term effect of this bill and the impact of this bill on the guiding principles of lawmaking going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066753">I do not stand to speak on this bill with the moral authority of one who has reached a point of suffering equal to those who may be applying for MAID. I do not think most members of the House here have the personal experience to speak on that level. However, I do stand here to speak on this issue because there has been a force in my life that carried me through some very dark nights of the soul when adversity, pain and repeated cycles of injustice were poignant enough to wear down my will to fight and to try, sometimes causing me to question the value of my existence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066754">I have seen this force raise addicts, cancer patients and those experiencing deep depression from deep pits of psychological paralysis and darkness. This force transcends the distinctions of race, gender, socio-economic background, etc. It is almost as vital as life itself. It is a force that is central to the existence of the human race, and that force is called “hope”. While hope is easier to access for some than others, for others it may be almost impossible, because their painful experience is choking the light from their vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066755">As caring individuals, as communities and as a nation that prides itself on compassion, it is our duty to turn over every stone to help others find hope when they can no longer access it themselves. Hope is a journey that demands an unrelenting search until it is found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066756"> We saw it with Terry Fox. He is a national symbol of hope, because despite his painful struggle with cancer, he made the sacrifice he made with his cross-country campaign for cancer research because he was in search of hope and giving that hope to others. The story of his triumph over adversity, though his life was tragically truncated at such a young age, still continues to champion Canadians today, as Canadians respond by revering him as a national hero, because we value hope. We have seen the power of hope that compelled Terry to pass the finish line of his last breath.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066757">We see hope whenever we see Team Canada send our paralympians to the Olympics. Many of them have overcome deep physical, emotional and mental suffering. Their focus, discipline and excellence have helped them to overcome their challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066758">Our nation is built on a foundation that values the sustenance of life and the right to prosper. We invest millions of dollars every year in first responders, medical services, infrastructure and laws to protect the survival, sustenance and prosperity of the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066759">However, expediting the administration of death is counterintuitive to the inner reach for hope in the human condition. Our very Constitution is founded on the principles of the value of human life, the prosperity of each human being and each one's access to the opportunity to flourish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066760"> While deep with the intentions of compassion and the appropriation of dignity, intervening with easier access to MAID opens a door to a very complicated path of further suffering, even for those who live on. </ParaText>

Another disturbing aspect to Alan's story is that despite his family's attempts to be involved in his life and an advocate for his life, his family members report that the hospital staff would not share information with them and shut them out from hearing the key facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066768">There is more to this story, but I will leave it at that. This is accessible information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066769">The point I would like to illustrate here is that this is a very complicated issue. It is one that touches something so deep and necessary to our existence and our country, and that is hope. All because of the irreversibility of death, there is little intervention that can be done afterward when hope is terminated because there is no breath to receive the assistance of hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066770">Rather than be in a rush to legislate this bill, we should focus on tackling things like the epidemic of suicide among first nations communities and youth. We should also focus on giving Canadians better access to mental health care so Canadians have greater access to hope when faced with situations of suffering, as people who are suffering so much consider MAID. We must do this until there are enough measures to show the flourishing of hope and human prosperity to counter a potential culture of death from capturing our nation, if we are to be too swift and lenient in our decisions surrounding issues of death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066771">It pains me to watch others suffer, but it also pains me to think that as lawmakers, our focus is on expediting access to death rather than expediting access to hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066772">My statement in the House today is to inspire all members of this House to not only consider the dignity of the people suffering seeking release through death, but the dignity of existence and human prosperity for the long term.</ParaText>

The government's original legislation, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, went though extensive consultation. It is scheduled for parliamentary review this summer. I would ask the Liberal government to respect the process and allow the review to proceed rather than rush this very sensitive and complex issue in legislation. Let us give this time because death is irreversible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066774">I have decided to look at this bill through a filter of hope and preserving a culture of hope, as being a force that guides the laws we make not only today but for decades and centuries to come.

              <ParaText id="6066775">Madam Speaker, I wanted to applaud my colleague's courage and recognize that every word she spoke today is probably the same words that all of us as parliamentarians have spoken. Hope is eternal. Hope is what gives us all the energy to fight the battles we have in our lives and in our family's lives. We must never eliminate that hope people want to have in various aspects in their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066776">When we dealt with this bill previously, it was amazingly complicated, as my hon. colleague mentioned. It was probably one of the most difficult issues I have had to deal with in my 20-some years as a parliamentarian. By listening to people, like my colleague and others, we try to find the way that reflects the feelings of so many people.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066779">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's compassionate remarks. I am very emotional right now because it is a very important issue for everyone, and in some way or another we are all impacted by it. I have spent time on the front lines. I believe, whether it is in the area I represent or anywhere else in Canada, there is a lack of access to counselling and mental health care that would, as I mentioned in my speech, give tools to Canadians to work through their struggles, adversity and pains to access more hope before moving in the direction of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066780">I understand fully the implications of compassion that this piece of legislation is wanting to present, but because of the irreversibility of death, I feel time is needed.

              <ParaText id="6066781">Madam Speech, we do not hear the word hope very often in this place and it is something that is very important. I would like to make two comments. One is that death is hard, death is very hard, but it does not mean it is without hope. When my sister died it was brutal, it was unfair, but it was life. We brought her out in the old Celtic way with singing and celebration because that is what we do. There is hope in that and hope has to be about compassion and doing what is right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066782">Second, I would like to ask my hon. colleague about the lack of action she mentioned on the horrific suicide crisis we are facing.

When I hear the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talk about losing patience, I think of the patience that has been lost by children as young as nine years old, 10 years old and 11 years old who do not even believe that this country cares about them enough that their lives are worth living.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6066785">Madam Speaker, I rise today to address a very important piece of legislation. Looking at it, I could not help but reflect on the previous debates that we had and the process in the development of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which led us to the point where we are today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066786">If members who were not here want to get a good sense of how thorough the debate and discussions were, I recommend they take a look at some of the comments in the standing committees, the many lead-up discussions, different presentations and the pre-study that was conducted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066787">I enjoyed listening to the debates then, because like the member who just spoke said, we heard a lot of personal stories. When people ask me what I enjoy about being in the chamber, it is the different types of debates that we have. These are the ones, like the debate today, that I learn from. I appreciate the stories that come before the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066788">We are all concerned about protecting vulnerable individuals in our society. At the same time, it is important as legislators to have a role to support the eligible person to be able to seek medical assistance in dying. It is a very difficult issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066789">A good number of us felt with the passing of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> that we had something that would move us forward. Even during the height of that discussion, there was a feeling that in a number of years we should review it and take a look at what has transpired in the previous years. We are quickly getting to that point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066790">However, last September, a Superior Court in Quebec made a determination. Members of the Conservative Party say maybe we should have appealed that decision. I respect that opinion. I do not necessarily believe that would have been the best direction for the government. The direction we have chosen is to make changes to the legislation now, in the hope that we will better serve Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066791">Having said that, once we get into the summer months, there is going to be a great deal of discussion because it is mandated. When I think of the Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> debate, and I will provide some personal thoughts on the issue of palliative care, I would like to see us talk about the issue of mental illness. I am hoping that, when we do that comprehensive review, we incorporate that along with palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066792">I am sure I am not unique and that all 338 members would concur when we think of health care in Canada, there are a couple of issues at our doors: the issue of mental health care services and palliative care services. I used to be the health care critic 15 years ago in Manitoba. We did not have the same sort of dialogue that we hear in the last number of years on those two critically important issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066793">British Columbia many years ago elevated the issue of mental illness and made it a separate ministry. There was a minister of health and a minister of mental health illnesses. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066794">I say that because, more and more, provinces are aware of the issue and the importance of mental illness. The Government of Canada has invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the last number of years, and continues to invest in mental illness and palliative care across the country. We are on a very strong footing when we look at where we are today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066795">We need to reflect on what brought us here. There were many consultations: literally thousands of people were engaged and many hours of debate and dialogue took place. It could have been in the thousands of hours. I do not know that for a fact, but I am sure that, between the time committees met on second reading of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the amount of consultation with Canadians in all regions of the country and the responses received via all sorts of mediums, hundreds of thousands of Canadians in all regions of our country were able to weigh in on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066796">If we advance to January of this year, again there were consultations and round tables that took us to the different regions of Canada. There was the survey that has been referenced already today on several occasions. Approximately 300,000 Canadians were engaged in that particular survey at the beginning of the year. I do not know if all of the results have gone public to date, but I trust the individuals who helped formulate the legislation we are debating today did their homework in terms of consultations and incorporating all of the ideas. I know the Department of Justice and the Department of Health are following this debate and listening to what members have to say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066797">From a personal perspective, based on experiences I have garnered over the years, there are two concerns I want to express. One is with regard to health care services and the other deals with the legislation itself. Let me expand on both points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066798">If we were to ask Canadians what makes them feel good about being Canadian, we would often hear our health care services. I suspect this is probably number one. I referenced mental illness and palliative care. I have witnessed first-hand the evolution of palliative care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066799">My grandmother was in the St. Boniface Hospital, and many hospitals in our country have palliative care sections. Many of them panel seniors, in particular, who cannot get the quality care necessary in personal care home facilities or the supports they need in their communities and in their homes, so they end up going into hospitals and are panelled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066800">Many of them will go into palliative care because there are no designated palliative care units in health care facilities, so they end up in hospitals. My grandmother was one of them. She had terminal cancer, and we watched as the weeks went by. Family members visited and it was very difficult on them. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066801">We had a very special relationship, as we all do with our grandparents. Many of us wondered why she had to be in a hospital. Even though it was kind of sectioned off from the emergency department and other aspects of the hospital, she was still in a hospital. It is a different type of a situation, and not necessarily the most comfortable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066802">Ultimately, my grandmother passed. Then, a number of years later, I had the personal experience of being there for my father in the days prior to his passing. He had to go from home into a hospital, and we were very fortunate that we were able to get him into the Riverview Health Centre. In that centre, with its large windows and beautiful atmosphere, you get the feeling that the type of care is very different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066803">I reflect on that. I was there at the moment of my father's passing, and we had discussions a number of days prior when he was in fear of what was going to happen, because he witnessed what had taken place with his mother, my grandma, at the St. Boniface Hospital. He did not have that choice, but we talked about having that choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066804">I think, knowing my father, he would have been very happy with the way in which he ultimately passed. I really attribute it to his world-class treatment at that particular facility, and I kind of wish that my grandmother had the same sort of atmosphere. Not to take away from the fantastic work that those health care providers and others did at the St. Boniface Hospital, but it was a totally different atmosphere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066805">During the Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> debate, we heard many stories like the one we just heard from the member opposite. They are very touching, they are compelling and they make us ask what we can do here in Ottawa to ensure that we have the best quality of health care services we can possibly provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066806">It is one of the reasons I am very passionate on the issue of the national framework. It does not have to be a system where we have one thing in British Columbia and another in Atlantic Canada or in the province of Quebec, or in provinces that do not have the same economic means or the same sort of treasury to provide the type of service that they should. This is where the national government has a role to play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066807">When I listen to comments inside the House with regard to where we might want to go from here, or very serious concerns about the current legislation, I would suggest that we reflect on what we are going to be able to potentially do in the coming months, when we have the opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066808">Unlike in the Manitoba legislature, our standing committees can be exceptionally effective. It is truly amazing, the type of authority, ability and participation that we can witness if we are prepared to park our partisan hats at the door and try to do what is best for Canadians on this issue. If we can take a look at what took place, with regard to <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that we can do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066809">If members listened to the previous speaker, they would get a sense of what was taking place when we had the debates on <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. Whether it is in the health standing committee or whatever it is that we come up with collectively, with representation from all the parties, I would encourage them to take into consideration the possibility of going outside of Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066810">Maybe we should look at different regions and see what some of these other provinces are doing, and maybe tour some of the palliative care facilities. There is a great variance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066811">We need to look. If I reflect on the province of Manitoba, we should take a look at what is happening in Winkler, Flin Flon or Winnipeg. We should take a look at the difference between Riverview Health Centre and what takes place in the Seven Oaks hospital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066812">Where, and what role, can we play as a national government to ensure that we are maximizing the benefits of providing the type of palliative care that Canadians expect and deserve, given the limitations that we actually have? Only the national government can do that. I suggest it is going to be in a very important role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066813"> Earlier today, the standing committee on trade tabled the CUSMA deal, the trade agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico. Many of the members were taking pictures of that particular committee, feeling very positive in terms of what they had been able to accomplish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066814">My challenge to the health committee, if that is going to be the standing committee, is to take that role very seriously in terms of the potentially life-changing report it could produce for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066815">I truly believe that the will is there to support what that committee is hoping to accomplish. It is just as significant as, and maybe even more important than, the report tabled today by the trade committee, which from what I understand was supported unanimously by all members of the House. If one listens to the speeches thus far, I do not think anyone would dispute what I said in regard to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066816"> I really encourage the standing committee, in the strongest way I can, to look at the mental illness issue using the same principles I talked about regarding palliative care. It is such a critically important issue, and Ottawa needs to play a stronger national leadership role on that. Hopefully that will happen, but because of time I am only going to highlight a few very brief points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066817">The proposed amendments would allow for a waiver of final consent for persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable, in the sense that they have been assessed and approved to receive medical assistance in dying, and have made arrangements with their practitioners for a waiver of final consent in certain situations because they were at risk of losing decision-making capacity by their chosen date to receive MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066818">I also want to highlight that the government is very aware of the concerns about the increased risks when MAID is provided to persons who are not dying in the short term. The bill, therefore, proposes additional safeguards that would apply when a person's natural death is not reasonably foreseeable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066819">These new safeguards aim to ensure that sufficient time and expertise are devoted to exploring requests for MAID from persons whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable and that such people are made aware of, and seriously consider, available means for relieving their suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066820">There is another really important part to me, but maybe I will do it in the question-and-answer period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066822">In 2015, in the last election, the Liberals made a commitment that they would invest $3 billion in palliative care to make sure that palliative care across the country was as available as medical assistance in dying. To date, they have not fulfilled that commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066823">The problem we have with modifying the medical assistance in dying legislation is that those who would like to have palliative and hospice care, to feel loved all the way through to the end of their life with the assistance of medicines that would relieve their pain, do not have the capability to experience that. They should have equal rights to those who want medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6066825">Madam Speaker, I have a couple of quick points on that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066826">First, I do not necessarily concede to the member in terms of the commitment he has referenced. Record amounts of money have been transferred to the provinces to deal with health care. A historic number of dollars has flowed to the provinces. A significant amount of that has been allocated to palliative care, although I really do not know the actual dollar figure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066827">For the second point, I will pick up on the first point to try to alleviate the concerns the member has. I talked about the importance of having the committee go forward into the summer, and part of its discussion and study should take into consideration what sort of financial role Ottawa could be playing to support this. As I said, we want to make sure there is a sense of equity among the provinces. I think part of that study, which we will be having in the coming months, also needs to take into consideration the issue of the costs of palliative care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066828">Madam Speaker, the NDP is, in general, fairly happy with this new legislation because it would fix some of the real problems we saw in the original legislation, which we debated and passed in the last Parliament in reaction to the Supreme Court ruling. The Liberal government at that time ignored some very important parts of that Supreme Court ruling and just forged ahead with its own version of what it thought was best, and here we are, four years later, redoing everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066829">I wonder if the member could comment on that. Should we not have done it right the first time and not put all of these people, who are suffering so much, through additional duress for these past years?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066830">Madam Speaker, as the member knows, there was a debate process, and the passage of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> ultimately received, I believe, unanimous support from the House. However, there is no doubt that during that dialogue there were some differing opinions. The government at the time genuinely felt that this was the best way to proceed. Some wanted the government to go a little further. It is one of the reasons why we recognized back then that this was the type of issue, given the nature of the legislation, we wanted to come back to. Even if the Superior Court in Quebec had not made the ruling it did back in September of last year, the House would have reviewed the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066831">The decision by the Superior Court of Quebec allows us to speed up on this very important issue, and that is why the government has chosen to bring forward the bill. It might change to a certain degree, and we will wait and see what happens once it gets to committee, but even at the conclusion of the bill, we will still have this future study, which is a good thing.</ParaText>

A part of that also includes recognizing that the national government has a role to play in ensuring that the Canada Health Act is implemented and that we look at areas of health care, like mental health and palliative care.

              <ParaText id="6066846">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my very esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066847">The debate we are having today must be handled with restraint, dignity and composure. Partisanship has no place here. This is a serious matter, and our decision will have significant repercussions on the lives of many, and perhaps even on our own lives one day, because we all have to leave this world sometime. It is inevitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066848">The sad thing in all this is that, through decisions made in this very Parliament, our society has forced people who are suffering to suffer even more. People with severe medical conditions were forced to appeal to the justice system to have their most basic rights upheld. Worse yet, some had to go on a hunger strike to get access to medical assistance in dying by meeting the reasonably foreseeable death requirement. Do hon. members have any idea what we have asked these suffering patients to endure?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066849">These long-suffering people coping with illness, trying to get through the day in unspeakable physical and psychological agony, were forced to go to court or put themselves in a position where their death was reasonably foreseeable. Everyone knows that the justice system is backed up. The costs and delays are typically unreasonable. These people had to endure a veritable ordeal because we made a decision for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066850">We failed to make informed decisions that upheld individual liberty. It is a huge privilege to sit in this House, and with that privilege come serious responsibilities. We must honour our position. I want all members of the House to know that this time, we cannot fail. Courageous patients have had to fight the system to get us to make a wise, informed decision. The Superior Court of Quebec gave very clear directives. We must have the courage and vision to apply these directives and support this bill in principle, because it deserves to be improved in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066851">The Beaudoin decision in favour of Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon is very clear: “The Court has no hesitation in concluding that the reasonably foreseeable natural death requirement infringes Mr. Truchon and Ms. Gladu's rights to liberty and security, protected by section 7 of the Charter.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066852">We must read those last few lines carefully. They refer to the rights to life and freedom of choice. Which of us can presume to choose for someone else? I want to warn my colleagues against the temptation to think about themselves. I want to warn them against voting according to their own beliefs, philosophies or religion. Freedom to choose must be upheld, and in order to choose, we need options. The basis of the decision, which came after a very long wait and constant anguish, makes it very clear that this is about rights and freedoms. No one can choose for another person. We must remove the barriers so that everyone can live out their last moments in their own way, freely and without constraint. Of course, we must not fail to protect the most vulnerable, in accordance with the well-established rule, in medical practice, of free and informed consent. That means informed by exposure to all possible options, and free from any undue pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066853">This bill is a step in the right direction. It includes important precautionary measures and provides for the study of other important issues that need to be considered. Among other things, it would exclude people suffering solely from mental illness. I think that is a wise decision. This is an extremely complex issue that should be studied further. We cannot decide on this issue right now, hence the need to study it properly without skipping any steps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066854">We must also look at the issue of advance requests for persons newly diagnosed with a condition that may have an impact on their decision-making ability in the future. These are extremely sensitive issues that we must study with great care and a great deal of precaution. It is therefore wise not to include them for now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066855">Generally speaking, the purpose of this bill is to allow those suffering from degenerative, incurable diseases to have access to medical assistance in dying, whether natural death is reasonably foreseeable or not, except in cases of degenerative cognitive disease, as I was just saying. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6066856">For people whose death is reasonably foreseeable, this is about relaxing the rules by eliminating the 10-day waiting period between the written request and the administration of MAID. The 10-day waiting period may be waived if a person has been assessed and their request for MAID has been approved and arrangements have been made with their practitioner to obtain a waiver of final consent because the patient is at risk of losing their capacity to make a decision as the disease progresses or with the administration of pain-relief medication. That way, when making the request for MAID, the patient can agree to waive consent the second time if their pain is beyond treatment, even with care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066857">This last measure allows the person to live longer with a reasonable quality of life. The person therefore does not have to feel like they have to rush to request MAID out of fear of losing their capacity to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066858">For people whose death is not reasonably foreseeable, there is a 90-day delay between the request and the provision of the MAID service, unless assessments have been made and the loss of capacity is imminent. This time period must therefore be applied in a reasonable and reasoned manner. Who among us can guarantee that 90 days will be enough for some? Who among us can say whether 90 days will be too long a hell to endure for others? We are entitled to question the application of this delay. No one can say. That is why this clause and this entire bill will have to be implemented in a sensible, flexible and intelligent way. Practitioners are in the best position to determine what is valid and what is not when they work together with their patients, listen to them and, of course, treat them humanely. Ultimately, the priority must be the patients themselves, their well-being and their dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066859">I remind all members that although we are talking about dignity, this is above all about rights and freedoms. Every person at end of life must have options, and that individual is the only one who should be able to make that choice. We must not impose our own values and opinions. We must simply ensure that we provide a suitable framework regulating the practice of and the right to medical assistance in dying. We must respect the freedom of the individual. That is fundamental. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066860">I urge all parliamentarians in the House to consider the huge responsibility we must shoulder. We hold in our hands the fate of hundreds of thousands of people. Not only is the end-of-life suffering of these people in our hands, but the suffering and anguish of their family members is as well. It is horrific to watch a loved one suffer at end of life and to feel helpless. Some members of the House may be thinking about personal choices. As I mentioned earlier, we need to figure out a reasonable framework for this very complex act and, through all of this, maintain freedom of choice for these individuals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066867">With respect to mental illness, the Government of Quebec chose to study the issue more thoroughly before including it in the law. If two separate lawmaking bodies are making the same choices, that strongly suggests we are on the right path. I think it is a reasonable decision. Laws as impactful as MAID legislation must be drafted very carefully.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066884">Many MPs have very personal stories about the end of life of one of their loved ones. As the Bloc Québécois critic for seniors, it goes without saying that I have heard my share. Therefore, in my speech, I will recall the work done by the Bloc on this issue, the sensitivity that exists in Quebec regarding medical assistance in dying and, finally, the position of certain groups of seniors and women who have come to meet with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066885">First, let me go over the context again. In September 2019, the Quebec Superior Court ruled in favour of Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon, both suffering from a serious degenerative disease, stating that one of the eligibility criteria for medical assistance in dying is too restrictive. This criterion, that of “reasonably foreseeable natural death”, is found in the federal government's Act to amend the Criminal Code and to make related amendments to other Acts with regard to medical assistance in dying, and the provincial government's Act respecting end-of-life care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066886">Justice Christine Baudoin said it well in her ruling when she wrote: “The Court has no hesitation in concluding that the reasonably foreseeable natural death requirement infringes Mr. Truchon and Ms. Gladu’s rights to liberty and security, protected by section 7 of the Charter.” Those two individuals had argued that they were being denied medical assistance in dying because their deaths were not imminent.</ParaText>

I want to thank him for the work he has done on this file because, as he quite rightly pointed out, legislators did not do their job properly with Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. As a result, issues of a social and political nature are being brought before the courts. We need to make sure that people who have serious, irreversible illnesses are not forced to go to court to access MAID. That would be terrible, and yet that is what will happen if we cannot figure out a way to cover degenerative cognitive diseases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066888">However, we believe that it is important to be very cautious before making any decisions on questions related to mental health. That is why we are relieved that the bill does not address eligibility for MAID for individuals suffering solely from a mental illness. Indeed, this issue requires further reflection, study and consultation, which will be completed at the Standing Committee on Health as soon as the motion moved by my colleague from Montcalm is adopted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066889">For the second part of my speech, I would like to talk about Quebec's sentiments on this whole issue. Quebec was the first jurisdiction in Canada to pass legislation on medical assistance in dying. Wanda Morris, a representative of a B.C. group that advocates for the right to die with dignity, pointed out that the committee studying the issue had the unanimous support of all the parties in the National Assembly. This should be a model for the rest of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066890">Ms. Morris said she felt confident after seeing how it would work in Quebec and seeing that people were pleased to have the option of dying with dignity. The Quebec legislation, which was spearheaded by Véronique Hivon, was the result of years of research and consultation with physicians, patients and the public. It has been reported that 79% of Quebeckers support medical assistance in dying, compared to 68% in the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066891">In 2015, when the political parties in the National Assembly unanimously applauded the Supreme Court ruling on MAID, Véronique Hivon stated: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066895">Many people are not eligible for MAID because of the federal law governing the practice, which was imposed by a court ruling in February 2015. Four years after Carter, individuals whose quality of life is severely compromised by degenerative diseases are still being forced to ask the courts for permission to end their suffering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066896">In February 2015, the Supreme Court even struck down two sections of the Criminal Code prohibiting Canadian doctors from administering MAID. In Carter, the highest court in the land stated that a competent adult who clearly consents to the termination of life is eligible for MAID if that person “has a grievous and irremediable medical condition...that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066897">According to the AFEAS, the Supreme Court's criteria were very broad. In drafting the MAID eligibility criteria, the Government of Canada included the concept of reasonably foreseeable natural death only for people at the end of life, which excludes a significant number of people who are experiencing intolerable physical and mental suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066898">The entire process is based on the intensity of the suffering as assessed by a doctor and a panel of experts. The sick person's own assessment is not always taken into account. There are no compassionate criteria among the requirements for obtaining MAID. A person may be at the end of their life and be unable to make the request themselves because they cannot communicate. The law applies only to people who are able to give their free and informed consent up until the very end, which could be terribly traumatic and even cruel to those who have been suffering for years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066899">With regard to advance consent, the AFEAS spoke about the case of Audrey Parker, a woman from Halifax who died with medical assistance on November 1, 2018. She made a video three days before her death. In that three-minute video, she said that she would like nothing more than to make it to Christmas, but that if she became incompetent along the way, she would lose out on her choice of a beautiful, peaceful and, best of all, pain-free death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066900">The Barreau du Québec believes that the law should be amended to comply with the criteria set out in Carter and thus prevent court challenges from being filed by people who should not have to carry such a burden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066901">A panel of experts has studied this issue and recommends, under certain conditions, ending the suffering of patients who have previously expressed their wish to receive medical assistance in dying, but who subsequently become incapable of expressing their consent, in particular people with various forms of dementia or cognitive loss such as Alzheimer's disease. This is why AFEAS is asking, with respect to human rights, that the process of medical assistance in dying be based more on the rights of individuals and on respect for their wishes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066902">With respect to reasonably foreseeable natural death, it requested that the reference to “reasonably foreseeable natural death” be removed from the eligibility criteria. With respect to advance consent, it asked that the person's informed consent be respected and that it be given in advance. Also on the subject of advance consent, it asked that the consent anticipated, stated and recorded by the person be recognized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066903">In conclusion, today's debate demonstrates the need to act so that people suffering from degenerative and incurable diseases are no longer forced to go before the courts to challenge the terms and conditions surrounding eligibility for medical assistance in dying, and so that we can ensure the best possible continuum of care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066909">The existing framework involves a 10-day reflection period. The value of that is that people who are maybe at a particularly low point do not make the decision and then go through with the decision in a short period of time.

              <ParaText id="6066910">At the same time, the existing system already has a mechanism by which this reflection period could be waived.

              <ParaText id="6066921">I want to start by saying that this subject is no doubt difficult for many Canadians watching. It is one in which we try to reconcile our deeply held view that life is precious with the right to liberty and the right to make our own independent decisions. This is a place where parliamentarians need to reflect not only on our own values but on what our courts have said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066922">In the Carter decision, the Supreme Court determined that section 7 of the charter meant that our provisions in the Criminal Code on assisted suicide were invalid. It said there was a class of people who were entitled to have doctors and nurses assist them in dying, so in 2016, Parliament had to move forward with legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066923">I had the pleasure of being the chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights at the time. I listened to witnesses who had a myriad of opinions. I listened to professionals from all sides, including doctors, nurses, psychologists, people representing the disabled, and groups that advocated the right to die with dignity. What we crafted was a law that attempted to bridge all of those gaps. We knew that this law would not be in place forever. We knew that we, as a society and a country, would learn from the experiences of that law and that we would move forward with changes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066924">Indeed, I was very pleased that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights made some significant changes to the legislation. We carved out conscience protection for medical professionals so that they were not obliged to assist with medical assistance in dying if it violated their own conscience or their moral values. We said that the law needed to be looked at again five years later to look at various classes of people we had left out of the original law, such as mature minors and people suffering from mental illness, as well as to examine the issue of advance directives whereby people could make decisions before they declined into dementia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066925">We also required the review to look at palliative care and its availability across Canada, because the two issues are intrinsically tied together. We do not want people to ever make a decision that they need medically assisted death because they will be deprived of proper palliative care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066926">That review is coming up. I know that Canadians across the country will have the opportunity to pronounce on these issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066927">However, our courts have made another decision.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066928">In the Truchon-Gladu ruling in Quebec, the court ruled that a class of people were entitled to access medical assistance in dying in accordance with Carter. The legislation passed in 2016 had removed this class of people from the list of people eligible for medical assistance in dying. We must therefore remove the section that limits medical assistance in dying to people whose death is reasonably foreseeable. This amendment to the original law is designed to remove this class of people and to enable people who meet all of the other criteria to access medical assistance in dying, even if their death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066929">I support that position because I have not only looked at the court decisions but have also walked the experience of Canadians over the last four years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066930">We have heard of people who were enduring grave suffering and who should have been entitled to medical assistance in dying because they met every aspect of the law, except that no one could say with reasonable certainty that their death would happen in the near future. We heard, from Canadians everywhere in Canada who fall under that class, that this is unfair. The courts in the Truchon case and in a number of other cases have hinted that this requirement is unconstitutional, so the government is moving forward to respect the court's decision in Truchon and remove from the law the requirement for death to be reasonably foreseeable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066931">However, the government is also adapting the law to deal with other difficulties that have arisen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066932">We never talked about, or if we did, it was rare, the issue of people deciding to prematurely end their lives because they were worried they would lose capacity at a future date. People should not shorten their lives because they are worried that a month later they will no longer have the capability or capacity to make that decision under the terms of the law. If it will give people an extra two or three weeks or an extra month with their family, we should do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066933">Therefore, the law is being amended to allow people to offer consent to a medically assisted death even if they lose capacity, but it also establishes safeguards. In the event they get to that date and they no longer wish to have medically assisted dying, even if they have lost capacity, by any word, any gesture that is not involuntary, then the pre-consent will disappear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066934">I want to clarify this, because it has been talked about a great deal today. This is not an advance directive. These are people who already know exactly what their illness is, they are already suffering from this illness, they are in an advanced state of decline, they have no ability to relieve their pain by medical treatment reasonably accessible to them and they have, after being reviewed by two medical professionals and declaring before an independent witness, decided they want to offer consent to end their lives on a certain date, even if they have lost the capacity to consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066935">This is a really important change, and I credit the government for doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066936">I also want to look at the issue of how we have handled that class of people whose death is not reasonably foreseeable. We have established a 90-day waiting period in that case. We have not made this something that could happen in the 10 days that was previously reflected under the law. We have done so with due seriousness. We understand the differences and the challenges that the issue poses for people when their death is not imminent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066937"> For example, people could have a catastrophic event that occurs and their circumstances change suddenly. We want them to have a proper reflection period before moving forward with medically assisted dying. We also understand and have made the exception for those people who may lose the capacity to consent during that 90-day period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066938">The amendments to the bill reflect well where Canadian society has gone.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066939">I do want to say that when we passed the legislation in 2016, very few jurisdictions around the world allowed medical assistance in dying. It existed in Belgium, the Netherlands, Uruguay and five or six U.S. states.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066940">We were one of the first countries in the world to allow medical assistance in dying. For that reason, we chose to take things slowly.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066941">This new amendment to the original law takes us to a place where Canadian society has moved. Canadian society, much more than in 2016, accepts and supports medically assisted dying, because they have watched the practice happen. We have seen the challenges we have confronted with the existing law and we have taken steps to improve the law and comply with the Truchon decision.</ParaText>

I believe the 90-day period could be 75 days or 120 days. I believe that 90 days is a good compromise, but there is an exception. For people who obtain all the necessary authorizations from a doctor to have access to medical assistance in dying and who will lose the capacity to consent, there is an exception in the legislation that allows the waiting period to be shorter than 90 days. I believe that is a good step forward. I imagine we could propose amendments on this at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Those amendments will be studied by the committee. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6066958">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise on the topic of Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, as we embark on what I expect will be quite a lively and passionate discussion about issues that Canadians care deeply about and certainly my Pontiac constituents. I heard from them for several years on this topic, regular correspondence, regular discussions at the door, so I appreciate this opportunity to discuss certain aspects of our government's proposed changes to the federal MAID legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066959">It is timely to share some of the insights from three important studies on very complex and sensitive issues that were not included in the 2016 federal legislation. These are requests by people for whom mental illness is their sole underlying medical condition, advance requests and requests by mature minors. I hope we will get to all three of them, but may only get to the first two.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066960">When Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was debated in 2016, parliamentarians had difficulty finding common ground on how to address these types of requests within Canada's first assisted dying regime. Understandably, given the challenging nature of these issues and the limited time that was available, due to the Supreme Court's timeline, to deliver on acceptable approaches for Canada, parliamentarians collectively decided that more in-depth study and review of the evidence was needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066961">The legislation in 2016 therefore included requirements for the government to undertake independent reviews. There were strict timelines set out in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> and the studies that needed to be commissioned had to be done within six months of the coming into force of Canada's new legislation on assisted dying and the government was obliged to table the final reports on the studies within a further two years. Both of these timelines were met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066962">In December 2016, the government asked the Council of Canadian Academies, CCA, an independent organization that undertakes evidence-based expert study, to inform our public policy development and to take on these studies that were required by legislation. The resulting reports were tabled in December 2018, documenting extensive review of academic and policy research, stakeholder submissions and international experience in the three subject areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066963">They also included a broad range of perspectives from relevant health care professions, diverse academic disciplines, advocacy groups, indigenous elders, essentially the whole of Canadian perspective was brought to bear. In accordance with the CCA practice, they did not in fact contain recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066964">Two of the reports, one on request by individuals where mental illness is the sole underlying condition and the report on advance requests have been particularly informative during the development of our government's response to the Quebec's Superior Court decision in Truchon.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6066965"> I will first talk about mental illness. Under the current law, very few persons with mental illness as the primary source of their suffering are likely to be eligible for MAID. This is because most mental illnesses do not cause a person's natural death to be reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066966">Removing the reasonably foreseeable natural death criterion introduces the possibility for persons with mental illness to be deemed eligible for MAID, if they meet the remaining criteria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066967">During the recent federal round-table consultations held on MAID, we heard many concerns from participants who felt that not enough is known to safely extend eligibility for MAID to people whose suffering is caused by a mental illness alone. They felt that the issue required further examination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6066968">We also know that there is generally very little support for expanding eligibility among mental health care practitioners, such as psychiatrists and psychologists, and by organizations representing people with mental illness. The CCA report on this issue noted a number of challenges associated with the delivery of MAID to persons with a mental illness. </ParaText>

The Boers attempted to repel the Canadian advance and fierce fighting began. By 6 a.m. the Boers had surrendered, thus removing the enemy forces blocking the way to the Boer capital. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067258">Mr. Speaker, I will continue to speak to the report of the Council of Canadian Academies on the provision of medical assistance in dying to those struggling with mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067259">The complexity of the issue is reflected in the fact that the members of the Council of Canadian Academies working group had vastly different opinions on the subject. On the one hand, the reports note that symptoms of mental disorder can impair cognitive abilities, making it more difficult to understand or appreciate the nature and consequences of treatment decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067260">The word “incurable” is not generally used by clinicians in the context of mental disorders, which makes it difficult to assess the condition of a person with “irremediable” health problems under the current legislation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6067261">On the other hand, the report points out that the autonomy rights of an individual with a mental illness must be respected. The report cites the experiences of Belgium and the Netherlands, which permit assisted dying for psychiatric conditions, with additional safeguards. However, the report also acknowledges that assisted dying for persons with mental illnesses in these jurisdictions remains controversial, and the public debate is ongoing. Ultimately, the working group could not reach consensus on ways to address complexities and mitigate risks associated with mental illness and medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067262">On the topic of advance requests, the Council of Canadian Academies report on advance requests also documents considerable evidence and provided many instructive findings on an issue of great interest and concern to many Canadians. Particularly in our riding, this was an issue I heard a lot about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067263">An advance request is a request for assisted dying made well in advance and in anticipation of the time when the person making the request may face suffering and other circumstances that may make them eligible for medical assistance in death. An advance request would set out conditions under which an individual requests MAID to be provided at a future date. Advance requests are premised on the likelihood that when people's health circumstances deteriorate to the point where they would want an assisted death, they would no longer have the capacity to affirm their decision immediately before receiving medical assistance in dying. In other words, that critical requirement of giving final consent would not be possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067264">Many people express the desire to make an advance request so they have the comfort of knowing they will be able to avoid a lengthy period of grievous suffering for themselves and for their families. This is in the event they succumb to an illness that could leave them severely impaired and lacking cognitive capacity for a lengthy time period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067265">The CCA report helped unpack advance requests, in a way that really was helpful, by outlining several scenarios of increasing complexity. The first scenario involves an individual at the end of life who has been assessed as eligible for medical assistance in dying, but fears losing capacity while waiting to receive it. This is the situation experienced by Audrey Parker from Nova Scotia who chose to receive MAID earlier than she had wanted in fear of losing her eligibility status.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067266">The second scenario involves an individual who has been diagnosed with a serious condition, but does not yet qualify for medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067267">The third scenario involves an individual who wants to plan for various future outcomes, prior to any diagnosis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067268">The report indicated that when the request is farther in advance of the procedure, it becomes more challenging for health care providers to be certain that the request still reflects the wishes of the individual. The report found that the first scenario poses the least risk and is relatively straightforward. Canadians expressed a great deal of support for this scenario in the federal consultations and it is also widely supported by experts and practitioners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067269">Our proposed amendments in Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> would permit this type of advance request. This means that an individual who has a reasonably foreseeable natural death, and who is assessed and approved for medical assistance in dying, can wait for their chosen date without worrying about losing decision-making capacity. If the person does lose capacity prior to that date, they would still receive medical assistance in dying on the requested date or earlier, as expressed in their advance wish. It also means that individuals no longer need to reduce required pain medications and endure additional suffering in order to maintain their capacity to consent right before the procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067270">However, the other two scenarios, where significantly more time passes between preparing a request and medical assistance in dying provision, are far more complex and challenging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067271">I want to point out that we have definitely made movement on that first aspect. It is in those other two aspects where there is significantly more debate, and those need to be taken care of by Parliament in the coming months, which is exactly what this bill provides for.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067272">Mr. Speaker, it is really interesting that this member actually makes very explicit the slippery slope that so many people are concerned about, because when <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> first came out, the ministers at the time defended it as representing a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067273">Now, we have legislation that removes safeguards and this member talks about the possibility of new legislation very soon after the statutory review in June that would remove further safeguards. We have seen dramatic increases in the rate of people accessing euthanasia in each of the last four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067274">I wonder if people should be reasonably skeptical when the government talks about the balance that it is trying to establish, when every single time this comes up, they want to remove more and more of the safeguards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067275">I will pick on one safeguard, the idea that there could be a 10-day waiting period, one that can be waived in certain circumstances, but by and large is in place. That seems to be eminently reasonable. There is also the idea that there should be two witnesses who observe the consent. These basic safeguards, the 10-day waiting period that could be waived and two witnesses, are very reasonable things that the government wants to do away with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067276">It makes me wonder, in the next iteration of this legislation, what safeguards at that point will the government remove. How many safeguards do they intend to take away? What is wrong with having some checks and balances in place protecting vulnerable people?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067280">My question is about the final consent waiver, proposed subsection (3.2). It seems that it is tied directly to entering an agreement in writing with a medical practitioner or a nurse practitioner. That medical practitioner or nurse practitioner would administer a substance to cause the patient's death on a specific date. I am just wondering whether it is actually tied to that practitioner or whether it could be transferred to another practitioner, in the case where that medical practitioner with whom the patient made the agreement is unable to go forward with those wishes at that time, when the patient needs medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067288">I am fully aware that many Canadians have serious concerns. Many are looking for solutions that will keep our communities safe, and they want us to begin the process of rebuilding the public's confidence in our justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067289">The legislation we are dealing with today is about one of those issues that almost every Canadian has heard of and will be, undoubtedly, following in the news. As a member of the Conservative caucus, I can debate this legislation and vote on it as I see fit. It is my intent to improve this legislation and to do the best I can in representing the good people of Brandon—Souris.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067290">Like many Canadians, I find discussing the implications of medical assistance in dying challenging. There is no sugar-coating the fact that, for many people, it is extremely difficult to openly discuss the issue of death. As a result of to the Carter decision, it was left up to Parliament in 2016 to determine the appropriate legislative response in order to be compliant with section 7 of the charter. It must also be said that the Carter decision was specifically limited to a competent adult who gave her consent in receiving medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067291">When we were seized with dealing with the legislation, many members of Parliament felt the government's response did not go far enough. One of the Liberal MPs who voted against the legislation was none other than the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. Some members were quite concerned about the lack of clarity, such as in the term “reasonably foreseeable”, which was left undefined. Other members wanted Parliament to supersede the Carter decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067292">Disagreement is not new in this place. It is to be expected in Parliament, with members from all political stripes and backgrounds. I would argue that our democracy is much better served having such divergent views as to guarantee that every position is fleshed out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067293"> When we debated Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, our Conservative caucus studied the legislation with the rigour that Canadians demanded of us. We asked the tough questions, we put forward amendments and we did what we were sent here to do, which was to ensure the concerns of our constituents were put front and centre. It is my sincere hope that we once again invest the necessary time on this and be as inclusive as we can so that all Canadians have their say on Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067294">It goes without saying that there are deep divisions on the overall issue of medical assistance in dying. I know every member of Parliament is hearing from constituents on this issue, and in the past couple of weeks numerous petitions have been sent to all members' offices. I would also note that in the election, I received inquiries on the future of the legislation and on whether Parliament would be reviewing it anytime soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067295">One of the elements in the original legislation was to have an automatic review, which will be undertaken this summer. It is notable that the legislation now before us has pre-empted the automatic review on a few matters. This upcoming review will be far more comprehensive than the two-week online survey used for Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067296">From what many were expecting, the legislation that was set to be introduced was to respond to the Superior Court of Quebec's ruling. We now know that this is not the case. In fact, yesterday during debate, the <Affiliation DbId="253813" Type="18">parliamentary secretary of justice</Affiliation> acknowledged that the Liberals did go above and beyond, because that is what he thinks Canadians want. While that may be his opinion, it is concerning that the larger changes found within Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> could have been dealt with in the larger review this summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067297">What we are debating today has numerous changes that go much further than deleting and replacing the phrase “reasonably foreseeable” in order to be compliant with the recent court decision. For example, the government is easing safeguards, which I might add is the actual language found within the presentation with which departmental officials briefed MPs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067298">As it stands, patients must make a written request for MAID that is witnessed by two independent witnesses. In Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, this has been changed to one independent witness. I believe it is incumbent on the government to justify this change and to outline the rationale for why it needed to be amended. The government is also removing the mandatory 10-day period after the written request is signed. Once again, this is a significant change that goes above and beyond what was required for the law to be in compliance with the Quebec Superior Court decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067299">It is my intent to invite as many experts, health care professionals and provincial governments to committee to ask them about the proposed changes and to determine if they are in fact needed. We must be cognizant that MAID still has the necessary safeguards in place to protect the vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067300">I want to put on the record that many of the issues we raised in the last Parliament, such as enshrining conscience legislation in law for medical practitioners, has fallen on deaf ears. This was an almost universal position among my Conservative colleagues, and the Liberal government of the day did not adopt those measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067301">We were also quite adamant about improving access to palliative care. Even though the delivery of health care falls under the purview of provincial governments, we passed a private members' bill to implement an action plan. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252595" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation>, who worked hard to get this legislation passed, is very disappointed that the government's five-year action plan failed to commit enough resources or outline a clear set of measurable outcomes. In a rural riding like mine, there are not enough palliative care services available. My heart goes out to those families who must send loved ones to a different community in the final days of their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067302">As a champion of rural Canada, I know first-hand the unique challenges that millions of people face every day due to their isolation or remoteness. I want to give the benefit of the doubt to the government that it is committed to rural Canadians, but its record says something completely different. While these issues cannot be fixed in this legislation, we cannot treat them in isolation while discussing MAID.</ParaText>

That was a bit problematic, as was getting two signatures.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6067320">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code regarding medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067321">My office has received about 135 phone calls, emails or letters so far on this issue, and I recognize that this is a very touchy, personal and non-partisan issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067322">I will begin with a quick bit of history. The MAID legislation came into law in June 2016. Recently, one judge in Quebec ruled that the wording in the legislation on “foreseeable death” was too restrictive. The Liberal government was very quick to accept this ruling. It chose not to appeal, and instead moved to rewrite the legislation taking into account the decision of the court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067323">This caused me to compare this ruling to the recent Alberta court ruling in which four judges found the carbon tax to be unconstitutional. It made me wonder if the government is going to be as quick to accept the Alberta court ruling as well and not appeal it, but that is a digression. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067324">As I said, MAID is a very touchy, personal and non-partisan issue. One can always find examples of people for whom MAID legislation is a difficult but welcome option. Unfortunately, those simple examples are usually in the minority. Far more often, it is much more complicated than that. The stories I have heard reflect these complications, such as the case where families are caught by surprise with a death and then forced to deal with the aftermath of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067325">There are cases where a person is at a particularly low point in their health but, under this proposed legislation, would be able to request and receive MAID with no waiting period. There are cases where physicians or hospital officials apply pressure on individuals to consider MAID. For example, Roger Foley, an Ontario man who is suffering from an incurable neurological disease, said that the medical staff repeatedly offered him MAID, despite his repeated requests to live at home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067326">There is also the B.C. case of Ms. S. Dr. Wiebe lamented the profound suffering of Ms. S. but felt that Ms. S. was not eligible for an assisted death. Then, unfortunately, Ms. S. decided to starve herself. Dr. Wiebe and another doctor then determined that, due to the severe malnutrition and dehydration of Ms. S., her natural death was reasonably foreseeable, so Dr. Wiebe euthanized her on March 2017. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067327">According to a Globe and Mail article, this case is the first to be made public in which a medical regulator has ruled on the contentious question of whether doctors should grant assisted death to patients who only satisfy all the criteria of the federal law after they have stopped eating and drinking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067328">It is not difficult to imagine a situation where a hospital will, for reasons of efficiency, encourage its staff to suggest MAID to patients with chronically difficult and complex cases. It is not a simple problem. It is a very complex problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067329">What bothers me about this is that the government is pre-empting the parliamentary review process that was specified in the legislation. We know that the current <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> voted against the party on the original legislation because he felt that it did not go far enough. Now, as justice minister, he is able to make the changes that he desired. This is troubling, because he is choosing to pre-empt the legislated review process and get his desired changes into legislation without consultation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067330">The existing law mandates the review of the legislation every five years, and the review will happen in just a few months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067331">Why is the government is such a rush to make substantive changes to this legislation and pre-empt the legislated review process? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067332">To me, it makes far more sense to deal with the specific issue raised by the Quebec judge only, then do a proper consultation with Canadians this summer and propose changes based on that. Instead, the government had an extensive online survey that lasted two weeks. While it received a lot of responses, I think it just proves that there is great interest, and Canadians have a lot to say about this issue. So far, the results of these responses have not been shared, and I ask for these responses to be shared. I call on the government to do the right thing and leave any changes beyond what the Quebec judge has asked for until the completion of the review process later this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067333">Since we are talking about changes to this legislation, I want to talk about palliative care. There are calls for a pan-Canadian strategy on palliative care. I think it is convenient to point to the provinces and say that this is their problem, but there cannot be a full end-of-life strategy without funds and laws around palliative care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067334">The government broke a key election promise to invest $3 billion in long-term care, including palliative care. Access to palliative care is an essential part of end-of-life decision-making. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067335">I have a personal example from Saskatoon, which has 12 palliative care beds for an area with over 300,000 people. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067336">My mother-in-law had a terminal disease. In her case, MAID was neither requested nor desired. She was fortunate in that her death was relatively quick, and by some miracle she was able to get one of those 12 beds in Saskatoon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067337">It should not take a miracle to get good end-of-life care. It should not be that MAID is the only reasonable solution at the end of life because palliative care is not available. Therefore, I call on the government to put as much effort into palliative care as it has into MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067338">Another significant area of concern is conscience protection. Physicians and health professionals must be given strong conscience rights. They must be free to not participate and be free of penalty or harassment for making that choice. They must also be free to not be required to refer to another health professional. They must have full conscience protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067339">Further, it must be recognized that the conscience objection of institutions must be protected. Institutions are not bricks and mortar. They are collections of people with values. Therefore, institutions must also be given the right of conscience protection. Several Supreme Court cases are instructive here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067340">The Supreme Court in 2015, in the Loyola case, stated:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067344">We must respect the multicultural nature of Canadian society. We must respect both medical professionals and institutions, and allow them to have full conscience protections free from harassment and consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067345">There are some specific changes proposed that I am concerned about. The current legislation includes a 10-day waiting period between when MAID is requested and when it can be administered. The current legislation already allows for this waiting period to be waived. It states that if two medical practitioners:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067346">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...are both of the opinion that the person's death, or the loss of their capacity to provide informed consent, is imminent—any shorter period that the first medical practitioner or nurse practitioner considers appropriate [can be used] in the circumstances.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067347"> There already is a provision to deal with this issue. There is no need to make changes. The situation has been contemplated and addressed in the current legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067348"> Another area of concern is the lack of safeguards for the mentally ill. Mental illness is a very complex situation. Patients diagnosed with an underlying mental health challenge are not required to undergo a psychiatric assessment by a psychiatric professional to determine whether they have the capacity to consent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067349">There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the issues of mental health. However, it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which a person is in a particularly dark period and considers MAID. It may well be that with proper professional help that person can work through the darkness and emerge a bit better. This may not always be the case, but that is why having a general waiting period is so important. It eliminates the ability of medical professionals or others to make a quick decision that they regret.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067350"> A poll in January found that Saskatchewan and Manitoba had the lowest support in the country for MAID. In 2018, in Saskatchewan, only 67 of 172 applicants for MAID actually received medically assisted death. Some were declined, some withdrew and some died before the request could be completed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067351"> In summary, I would make the following observations. Most importantly, in the words of a constituent I spoke with this week, “We need to slow this down, not speed it up.” Yes, we need to deal with the Quebec court decision, but that only requires one change. There is a legislated review that will happen this summer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067352">Let us wait for a proper consultation and use that lens to view any proposed changes. Let us have a pan-Canadian strategy for palliative care. Let us put full conscience protection in place for physicians and health care professionals. Let us put conscience protection in place for institutions. Let us leave the 10-day waiting period and the ability to create exceptions the way it is. Let us deal with the Quebec court decision and leave the rest until after the legislated review this summer. Let us slow this down. </ParaText>

If there were more and better palliative care options, while I do not know about the specific case the member mentioned, then more people would have other options than MAID. I believe, though, that is another solution.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6067368">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in this House to speak today about Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>. This bill would amend the medical assistance in dying regime in the Criminal Code to address the Superior Court of Quebec's decision in the Truchon case. As members know, in September 2019, the Quebec Superior Court struck down the eligibility criterion of “reasonably foreseeable natural death” from the medical assistance in dying, or MAID, regime in the Criminal Code. Our government has made significant efforts to consult and engage with Canadians in order to inform the proposed approach to address this decision and amend the MAID regime in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067369">An online consultation was launched, and over 300,000 responses were received from Canadians. In addition, the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> had the opportunity, along with their parliamentary secretaries, to meet with stakeholders and experts across the country during a series of round tables all over Canada. These consultations were an extremely important part of the development of Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067370">Medical assistance in dying is a sensitive and challenging social issue that we are currently faced with, one that is deeply personal for very many people and for me personally. I worked as an oncology nurse at St. Joseph's hospital in Toronto and have seen end-of-life care first-hand. I have seen individuals making difficult end-of-life decisions for themselves or their loved ones, and I appreciate our government's decision to consult and listen carefully to Canadians on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067371">In addition to being deeply personal, the issue of medical assistance in dying is also legally and ethically complex, which is why it was so important for our government to meet with experts, stakeholders and practitioners during the round tables. Our government listened. It listened to the health care experts, doctors, nurses, legal scholars and regulators, but most importantly, it listened to Canadians. The bill takes into account what was learned during these consultations and responds to the Truchon ruling by proposing amendments to the Criminal Code that would ensure consistency of the MAID law across the country by broadening eligibility, and adjusting the safeguards accordingly, for a MAID regime that is no longer limited to end-of-life circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067372"> Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes to amend the Criminal Code in response to the Truchon ruling in three ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067373">The first is by expanding eligibility to those whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable but who are still experiencing intolerable suffering. This will give those who are suffering in a wider range of situations the choice of a medically assisted death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067374">At the same time, the amendments would exclude those suffering from only a mental illness. This is in response to very specific concerns voiced by experts and mental health professionals about eligibility on the basis of a mental illness. Many members will also recall that during the study of former Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the government asked the Council of Canadian Academies to look into such cases. The experts in this field could not come to a consensus on this very complicated issue in their report on the subject, which was released and tabled in this chamber in December 2018. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067375">Our government recognizes that the unique considerations for the availability of MAID for individuals experiencing suffering only from mental illness requires further discussion and public debate. I believe the parliamentary review that will begin in June 2020 is the appropriate forum for the further consultation and deliberation that are needed before considering any changes in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067376">The second main feature of this bill is the creation of two sets of safeguards to be followed before medical assistance in dying is provided, depending on whether a person's natural death is reasonably foreseeable or not. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067377">The bill would continue to use the expression “reasonably foreseeable natural death” as the element that determines which safeguards to use. This approach for a MAID request is consistent with the view that medical assistance in dying for people whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable presents more complexity. Many experts believe that the assessment of a request should be tailored to these different types of cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067378">New safeguards for those whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable will focus on ensuring that assessments take adequate time and involve the relevant expertise to detect and address the sources of the person's suffering. They will also ensure that people receive information about the appropriate and available services and options to improve their quality of life. They will need to give serious consideration to those options before concluding that medical assistance in dying is the choice for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067379">Finally, the bill would relax some of the existing safeguards, in particular for those whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Those whose deaths are reasonably foreseeable will not need to undergo the 10-day reflection period. These individuals have already given a lot of thought to their request before they made it, and requiring them to wait another 10 days after they have been approved for medical assistance in dying may prolong their suffering unnecessarily. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067380">Just as importantly, the bill proposes to permit the requirement of final consent to be waived in the case of people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable when certain conditions are met. These conditions are that the patient's death must be reasonably foreseeable; they must have been assessed and approved for medical assistance in dying in accordance with all safeguards; they are at risk of losing decision-making capacity before their preferred date to receive medical assistance in dying; and they have a written arrangement with their practitioner, in which they have given consent in advance to medical assistance in dying being administered if they lose capacity, and in which the practitioner agrees to provide medical assistance in dying on their preferred date, or earlier, if they can no longer provide the final consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067381"> These proposed amendments would also clarify that practitioners would not be allowed, in this situation, to provide medical assistance in dying if the patient demonstrates refusal or resistance by words, sounds or gestures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067382">For individuals whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable, the remaining criteria defining the grievous and irremediable medical condition in the Criminal code would expand eligibility to medical assistance in dying to people with a wide range of conditions. A grievous and irremediable medical condition is defined in the code as a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability; an advanced state of irreversible decline in capacity; or intolerable suffering that cannot be alleviated under conditions that the person considers acceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067383">This means that a grievous and irremediable medical condition could include conditions producing chronic pain or other symptoms. Canada's medical assistance in dying regime would move away from being an end-of-life regime to becoming a regime in which MAID could be chosen to relieve unbearable suffering that occurs outside of the dying process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067384">To conclude, the bill before us today proposes the amendments required by the Truchon decision. It also reflects what we heard in 300,000 responses to the online consultation. This is what we heard from stakeholders when the ministers and parliamentary secretaries held consultations from coast to coast to coast. It takes into account the opinions and input of health care professionals, doctors, nurses, legal scholars, provincial regulators, civil society, non-governmental advocacy organizations and those with lived experiences. The bill strives to achieve a balance between respecting personal autonomy and protecting vulnerable individuals. Perhaps most importantly, it respects the equality rights of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067385">For those reasons, I call on the members of the House to support this bill, send it to committee where it can be looked at even more thoroughly and make this a reality in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067386">Mr. Speaker, I want to comment and pose a question to the member around one of the strands in today's debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067387">Members on our side have raised the need for safeguards because of the risk of abuse. Responding to an argument that was not made, government members have said they trust health care professionals to make good decisions in the vast majority of cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067388"> Of course, we also trust health care providers to make good decisions, to have good intentions and to do all they can to stay within the bounds of a patient's well-being in the vast majority of cases. However, the reason we have safeguards is to deal with that small minority of cases in which someone could actually lose his or her life as a result of pressure, as a result of a proper review not taking place, or as a result of being rushed into decisions in less than ideal circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067389">We talked about examples of this small minority of cases in which human lives are still very much in the balance. Because of this need to have safeguards for these situations, would the member accept that a default to a 10-day reflection period would provide some degree of insulation against the possible risk of someone in a dark moment, in a short-term thinking process, opting for something that on balance they would actually not opt for with the proper engagement of their full support structure? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067390">The 10-day reflection period can be waived in extreme circumstances already, so what is wrong with a 10-day reflection period?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067391">Mr. Speaker, I know this is very complex and a very personal issue. For those whose death is reasonably foreseeable, the bill proposes to eliminate the 10-day reflection period, 10 days that many practitioners say can prolong unbearable suffering. It is about patients and about the individuals and their rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067392">The requirement for two independent witnesses, which many experts indicated created difficulties for certain types of patients, would also be eased for eligible persons. Health care workers would be able to act as independent witnesses, provided that they are not the provider or the assessor.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067416"> It is very interesting for me to be here in a new Parliament discussing something we spoke about in the last Parliament. I was a fairly new member when Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was before the House. I had a lot of constituents calling my office, sending letters and emailing us on this very important issue. I spent a lot of hours responding to people, talking to them on the phone and hearing their stories. What I really respected was the thoughtfulness. There were concerns of course, which is legitimate, but there was a lot of hope for some people as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067417">Here we are back at it again. It reminds me of a dear friend and loved one who used MAID in his journey. His name was Joey. When I think of the core issue and value we are discussing today, which for me is unnecessary suffering, I cannot help but think of Joey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067418"> Joey had an illness that was slowly killing him. In fact, it was so painful for him that he made this decision. He rearranged his time of death so I could be there with him, which was a huge honour for me. I was so grateful for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067419">I think about the process we went through together that day. It was a beautiful process, but it was also a hard process. Part of the reason why it was so hard was he could not take any of his pain medication that day. He had to be totally able to answer that question. After a lot of thoughtful discussion, he had to stay in pain all day. We spent the day with him, but it was hard to see him suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067420">When we look at the bill before us today, that is what I hope all Canadians and all parliamentarians remember. We are here ensure nobody goes through unnecessary suffering like that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067421">One of the things that really struck me about the day when Joey passed was his doctor came to be part of the process. His doctor had made a decision that he did not want to be in a role to administer MAID, but he came. There were a lot of tears and remembrance of the long-term relationship. We also have to talk about the length of time some of our doctors have known us. Some have known us for years in some cases, and in Joey's case that was the reality. Another doctor was there for the process, but Joey's doctor was with him. His loved ones were around him. It was a peaceful process when he left us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067422">Today we are here to do this important work. I hope this goes to committee. I have had discussions with doctors in my riding who administer this process and they have a lot of good things to say about the bill, as well as some concerns they would like addressed, and I hope that will happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067423">As this process started, a lot of people started writing my office again. We did some outreach. We wanted to let people know that this would be coming up. We wanted them to know that there was a process for them to connect with us and give their feedback to the government on this issue. A lot of my constituents participated in the process online. Not only did they participate, they were very thoughtful to ensure that the information they submitted was also given to my office. In front of me, I have a small portion of the comments from the people who sent us information and shared their stories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067424">I want to be clear about something, and we have to remember this as we go through the legislation. I represent a rural and remote community. The doctors who provide this service sometimes spend the whole day travelling to the community to provide this very important service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067425"> There are some specific barriers and we want to ensure that in all our legislation we do not let those people in rural and remote communities down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067426"> There are three of these doctors in my region. The riding I represent is just under 60,000 square kilometres, it has several ferries and many small islands. The doctors in that area provide the total service for that area plus a portion of my neighbour's riding. They deliver the service to a huge number of people over a vast distance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067427"> Message after message thanked those doctors. In fact, Dr. Daws, a doctor in my riding, was mentioned repeatedly for being compassionate and for helping people go through this process in a very respectful way. People wrote me before they were going to participate in MAID. They just wanted tell me that this doctor had been very helpful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067428">I want to recognize the amazing health care providers in our country who provide this service, who do it in a sensitive and beautiful way. They are with people at one of the most precious moments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067429">I want to talk about Margaret who told us about her nephew. Her nephew had participated in MAID and that this was his decision. The biggest issue for her was the lack of the advance consent clause. He was given a choice of either going through this process two months earlier or not at all. Due to the medication he would have to take for his illness, it would automatically disqualify him from having the capacity to provide the consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067430">This is the biggest issue for me, because people were having to leave sooner than they wanted to because they were afraid they would lose the capacity to give their consent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067434">I think about Dolores, who sent me a beautiful message about ensuring the process was clear for people, wanting to have the accessibility to this be very clear and easy, and in an information package. Her biggest concern was that her family physician did not believe in this process and would not give her the information she needed to make the decision. She said that it would be good to have an information package that was a little more effective, so when a doctor was struggling with that personal choice, it would not impact the patient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067435">As a parliamentarian, these are the moments when I really respect the role I have on a whole new level, when people are telling me about the precious experiences they have had in their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067436">Another family talked about its father-in-law who spent seven years with dementia and was very well cared for, but in his last year, he rapidly deteriorated. His dignity plummeted. A loving son said that he was convinced that if he could have projected how his final years of deterioration would happen, he would have chosen MAID as an option, if it was available to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067437">Then there is Milt whose wife is in a care home. Because of her Alzheimer's, she will not be able to express herself. He is so concerned that she will suffer way too long and he does not want to see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067438">Another family talked about a friend who had cancer of the brain. Then she had a stroke. After her stroke, she was concerned that if she had a second stroke, she would be unable to state her wishes. Because of that, she participated in MAID sooner than she would have wanted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067439">This is a precious decision people make. It is a decision they make with their loved ones and their health professionals. I will be supporting the bill because I do not believe in people suffering unnecessarily. There are some challenges in the bill that I hope are clarified, especially looking at the realities for rural and remote communities. However, when people tell these personal stories, we hear again and again that they do not want to see people suffer, that they do not want to see people lose their dignity and that they want to ensure their wishes are honoured.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067449">I would like to talk to her about that dynamic specifically here. The bill states that the patient's death no longer must be “reasonably foreseeable” but requires patients to still have a “grievous and irremediable medical condition”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067450">The member and I appreciate our veterans but we are deeply concerned about the number of them who are choosing to end their lives because they do not feel well when they come back home.

Just bringing people food and reminding them to eat when they were going through that incredibly sad time is something I will never forget.

              <ParaText id="6067456">Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to once again rise in this House and speak to Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code (medical assistance in dying). This bill proposes amendments to the Criminal Code provisions on medical assistance in dying, or MAID, in response to the Superior Court of Quebec Truchon decision, which struck down the eligibility criterion that natural death be reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067457">I would like to highlight five major components that stood out for me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067458">First, it repeals the condition that a person's natural death be reasonably foreseeable, with the exception of patients whose sole underlying condition is mental health issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067459">Second, it introduces new safeguards in addition to existing ones for patients whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067460">Third, it permits the waiver of the requirement for final consent, allowing patients to provide consent to health care practitioners in advance, in the event that their death is naturally foreseeable and they are at risk of losing capacity to consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067461">Fourth, it permits the waiver of the requirement for final consent if a patient chooses MAID by self-administration, in case complications arise following self-administration, such as a loss of capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067462">Fifth, it modifies the MAID monitoring regime to require that health care providers and pharmacy technicians provide regulated information when assessing a patient's eligibility or when dispensing a substance for MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067463">Over the last two days, many of my colleagues from both sides of this House intervened on a fair number of details. It gives me great pleasure to see that there is broad agreement that this legislation, with these amendments, gets voted in and move to the committee for further study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067464">I rose in this House during the 42nd Parliament back in 2016, and shared my experience, which dealt with the tragic loss of my father as a result of stage 4 cancer back in 2014. Such assistance was not available to us and we saw the loss of dignity. We saw the loss of the person I called “my hero” losing the capacity to be able to function and lead our family, as well as the fact that his desire would have been met, had we had this type of assistance available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067465">Also, as the chair of the all-party mental health caucus, I have been advocating, and our caucus has been advocating, for the consideration of mental health and the exclusion of that. I am pleased to see that that remains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067466">As I was listening attentively to the interventions over the last two days, at times there were questions raised about why it took so long. Considering that, and considering that we are almost halfway through this debate, I decided to focus my intervention mainly on the journey that our government has gone through over the last four years. The key concepts within that journey are the challenges that we are faced with; the stakeholders that we engaged with; the consultations during the studies; and the implementation, successes and challenges we have had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067467">Having said that, since the introduction of the legislation for medical assistance in dying in 2016, we have witnessed a steady increase in the number of Canadians and health care providers who have adopted this new regime. We have seen a relatively smooth integration of MAID assessments and delivery in end-of-life care service available across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067468">The enactment of this historic legislation was just the beginning of our efforts. Our government has since been very active in supporting the implementation of MAID across Canada. The 2016 legislation included clear directives for action, including the need for government to initiate independent reviews on three complex issues not addressed in the bill back in 2016. Some of my colleagues before me touched on those complex issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067469">Rather than proceed too hastily, Parliament felt that it required more study and a review of available evidence. The government tasked the Council of Canadian Academies with undertaking these studies and that is where the journey started.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067470">The resulting report tabled in Parliament in 2018 reflected an extensive review of academic and policy research, stakeholder submissions and international expertise in all three areas. It documented a range of perspectives from health care professionals, academic disciplines, advocacy groups and indigenous leaders; hence, the stakeholders that we have engaged with. We expect dialogue on these issues to continue during the parliamentary review and, as I have indicated, I hope that everyone in the House votes for this so that we can move it to committee and continue this dialogue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067471">Taking into account our federal system and division of responsibility for health care and criminal law, the federal government developed the monitoring and reporting regime to collect valuable information about requests for and the provision of MAID. In all other jurisdictions permitting assisted dying, there is an oversight and monitoring mechanism in place. The roles and responsibilities of these monitoring regimes vary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067472">In the wake of this monumental shift toward legalized assisted dying, Canadians wanted to know what kind of uptake there would be. Some were keen to know how accessible MAID would be across this vast country. Others want to know how safeguards would be applied and if there were protections in place for the vulnerable. Our government worked quickly with the provinces and territories to establish an interim reporting system, collecting and reporting on the best data available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067473">I want to acknowledge our provincial and territorial partners that had the challenging task of arranging safe access to MAID services from scratch, in a short period of time and in collaboration with multiple partners, such as health care providers, professional associations and health care delivery institutions. This tremendous task involved setting standards of practice for physicians, nurse practitioners and pharmacists to support the consistent and safe delivery of MAID within a legally sound framework. It also helped minimize the disparity to access in rural and urban areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067474">Our government produced four interim reports using data voluntarily transferred by providers and various jurisdictions from 2016 until the creation of the permanent regime in late 2018. These reports covered a six-month period and provided information on the number of MAID deaths, patient demographic information, underlying medical conditions and predicted MAID requests. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067475">In reviewing these reports, we know that the awareness of MAID as a legal option is growing. There appears to be a growing comfort among health care providers. In the interim period, our government worked to establish a permanent national monitoring and reporting system as considered in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067476">Through stakeholder consultation and collaboration with provinces and territories, the government enacted federal monitoring regulations in late 2018. These regulations set out the reporting requirements for all physicians, nurse practitioners and pharmacists who participate in MAID. We were mindful of balancing the need for information while limiting the reporting burden on health care providers and avoiding duplication of effort. This system has been operating for just over a year. Late this spring, our government plans to release the first annual report using data from this new monitoring system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067477">Budget 2017 announced $11 billion over 10 years to support home and community care services, including palliative care, mental health and addiction services; $6 billion was specifically allocated to those services I talked about. In 2019, our government worked with all the provinces and territories to develop the framework for palliative care in Canada, which I consider a cornerstone of this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067478">Over the last three and half years that MAID has been available, our government has worked to support a smooth integration into the health care system based on the foundation I have just laid out. On the evidence that we have gathered, we have put together a bill that represents the Truchon decision and addresses other issues where there is clear consensus and a reasonable path forward. It is my hope that, after due consideration and debate, we move this bill to committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067479">I will close by saying that I support this bill and I thank all members for intervening on this topic.</ParaText>

While I do not want to impute unworthy motives on the part of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252915" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> with respect to his bill, it does raise certain questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067508">I submit that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252915" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> is attempting to do indirectly what he knows he cannot do directly. I submit that the practice of placing a bill on notice, making public the content of the bill, then placing another bill with a slightly different title to avoid a charge of premature disclosure of the content of a bill would set a dangerous precedent. In short, using this approach would subvert the principle that members should be the first to see the contents of a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067509">I would also like to draw the attention of members to the Speaker's ruling earlier this day concerning two bills that were substantially similar, despite a different long title. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067510">The Speaker stated, “I would like to take a few minutes to inform members of an error on the Order Paper. Two private member's bills, which are substantially the same, are currently listed under Private Members' Business. Items outside of the Order of Precedence, specifically Bill <Document DbId="10639683" Type="4">C-221</Document> on the Employment Insurance Act standing in the name of the member for Elmwood—Transcona was introduced and read the first time on Thursday, February 20, 2020, and Bill <Document DbId="10639072" Type="4">C-217</Document> standing in the name of the member for Salaberry—Suroît was introduced and read a first time on Monday, February 24, 2020. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067511">“Pursuant to Standing Order 86(4), the Speaker can refuse notice if he determines the two items as to be substantially the same. As a result, Bill <Document DbId="10639072" Type="4">C-217</Document> is currently before the House in error. I therefore direct it that the order for the second reading of Bill C-217 be discharged and the bill be dropped from the Order Paper.” </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067512">It would be interesting to see if the first bill that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252915" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> had placed on notice, if introduced, would be determined to be substantially similar to Bill <Document DbId="10660265" Type="4">C-238</Document>. While I cannot confirm this to be the case, it certainly gives rise to the assumption that the bills would be substantially similar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067513"> I further submit that if this practice was determined to be an acceptable practice, I can only assume that this approach could become common practice. Imagine the government placing a bill on notice, then making a public statement which comprehensively discloses the content of a bill, then make a slight change to the long title and place this new bill on notice followed by its introduction. This would be seen by members and perhaps by you, Mr. Speaker, as a clear departure from the long-standing principle that members should be the first to see the contents of a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067514">I will not waste the precious time of the House reciting the numerous precedents that support the conclusion that the premature disclosure of the contents of a bill between the notice and introduction period has been determined to be a bonafide question of privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067515">I do not begrudge the member for <Affiliation DbId="252915" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> for his attempt to get out his message about what his bill would accomplish and to provide the details of his bill to solicit the public's support for the bill. The fact remains that it is an affront to the privileges of the House to disclose a bill's contents before members of the House have had the opportunity to see the bill once introduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067516">I understand that there was a very similar issue raised on February 25, with respect to the unfortunate premature disclosure of the medical assistance in dying legislation. As a result, if you determine, Mr. Speaker, that this matter is a prima facie question of privilege, I would suggest that both matters be heard together at the procedure and house affairs committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067517">Mr. Speaker, I await your decision, and if you agree, I would be prepared to move the appropriate motion at the said time.</ParaText>

The Carter decision overruled that previous decision, and now Parliament has the difficult task of balancing the autonomy of Canadians with our responsibility to create safeguards for vulnerable Canadians. It is one of our most sacred responsibilities to protect the lives of our citizens. We need to get laws on assisted dying right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067535">The adoption of medical assistance in dying after the 2015 election is an event I am very familiar with. I had the honour of serving under the member for <Affiliation DbId="252830" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> as he took the lead as the Conservative vice-chair of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying. During this time, I was involved in all aspects of the committee that was making recommendations on a new law. I heard from all the witnesses, and I listened to all deliberations regarding what direction our country should take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067536"> That committee recommended a radical departure with very few safeguards. These recommendations did not reflect the testimony of experts, but instead the political agenda of special interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067537"> The Conservative minority report provided at the joint committee was entrenched firmly in the principles of the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, and included recommendations that were laid out by key witnesses, such as the former president of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, Dr. Karandeep Sonu Gaind. It outlined key principles for us on the issue of physician-assisted dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067538">These included not accepting the provision that assistance in dying be provided to those under the age of 18, in line with the Carter decision, which stated that only competent adults should be allowed access to assisted dying. We also did not accept the extension of medical assistance in dying for those suffering exclusively from mental illnesses. We did not believe that any mental illness is irremediable, as the Canadian Psychiatric Association stated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067539"> We also did not believe in the validity of advance directives to allow Canadians to consent to an assisted death far in advance of its administration. This change would stand opposed to the express will of the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that consent must be contemporaneous with the time of death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067540">We also recognized the lessons of the Quebec experience, as the first jurisdiction in this country to legalize euthanasia. In its regime, medical assistance in dying could only be rendered on adults with a severe, incurable physical illness, characterized by an advanced state of irreversible decline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067541">I believe many Canadians can sympathize with this limited exception for assistance in dying; however, even these safeguards have proved to be short-lived. Barely five years later, the courts and the government have decided that these safeguards are far too restrictive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067542"> How did we get here today? Barely had the ink dried on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> before proponents of expanded assisted dying launched their campaign to eliminate necessary safeguards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067543"> As a Conservative who strongly believes in the sanctity of human life, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was a difficult pill to swallow. However, it was one that I believed upheld many of the values that I hold and the values that many of my constituents hold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067544"> The previous legislation recognized that we must tread carefully with this new reality of assisted dying. It introduced safeguards that limited mature minors, those with exclusively mental illnesses and those whose deaths were not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067545"> I believe this is where the majority of Canadians are, and I believe the government largely got the balance right under Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. Unfortunately, there are a radical, vocal few who want to undermine even these protections and push this country headlong into a permissive regime for assisted dying, a regime that, as we know from international experience, has resulted in the deaths of vulnerable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067546"> If we continue to go down this road and liberalize all safeguards, we will continue to see mistakes and deliberate actions that end the lives of vulnerable people. This new legislation outlined in Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, although not taking these large, radical steps that I outlined, is opening the door to a wider radical departure from principles like the protection of the vulnerable and the sanctity of human life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067547">I am particularly concerned about the inclusion of the term and policy of advance consent. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067548">The Supreme Court of Canada was very clear, crystal clear, that an assisted death should only be administered with the consent of a person at the time of death. We know that there are some cases where people fear losing their capacity to end their lives. However, we cannot allow the precedent of advance consent to gain legitimacy in our system. Advance consent in this legislation I believe is a Trojan horse designed to build the legal case to accept the adoption of advance directives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067549">Advance directives are a concept by which people can direct the actions of medical professionals after they have ceased to have the capacity to consent to an assisted death. Many Canadians are familiar with DNRs: do-not-resuscitate orders. DNRs are a completely ethical and morally acceptable practice, whereby a patient can designate that no action should be taken to attempt resuscitation. By respecting the will of the patient and not acting, medical professionals are allowing the patient to die a natural death. Medical professionals can also hasten the natural death of their patient through pain remediation. I believe this is also an acceptable practice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067550">I support do-not-resuscitate orders, and I think many Canadians are being deliberately misled into believing that an advance directive is the moral and ethical equivalent of a DNR. It is not. An advance directive does not ask medical professionals to withhold action allowing a natural death. It requires medical professionals to take direct action to immediately end the life of the patient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067551">This is a leap in practice that goes far beyond what I believe is ethical. It undermines one of the greatest medical principles: first, do no harm. I can imagine, in a not-so-distant future, someone with dementia or Alzheimer's who had previously written an advance directive, believing that life would be not worth living with this disease. Imagine in the future that we had the medical expertise and the breakthrough pharmaceuticals that could make life better for those suffering. How can someone consent to have life end without contemporaneous consent at the time of death, when they cannot know what their quality of life will be?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067552">It introduces a high level of subjectivity to the question about what kind of life is a life worth living. This is a dangerous question that will lead us down a lethal road, a road that I do not think anyone wants to go down today. I believe it is unethical and dangerous to allow someone's life to be ended by an advance directive or consent, even with the meagre protections offered in Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which includes a provision that no resistance be shown. There is still a threat of abuse. If people are unable to understand and consent to death, how are they supposed to know to resist when someone comes to administer their death? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067553">Parliament is being rushed into liberalizing a practice that is not even half a decade old. Its members lack the experience, the data and the moral understanding to press forward with such a life-and-death issue. I am disappointed that the government abdicated its responsibility to stand up for vulnerable people when it chose not even to appeal the Quebec court's decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. What better court to clarify what safeguards are acceptable than the very court that originally dealt with these significant matters? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067554">Instead, the government has given Parliament little time to contemplate such an important issue. Canadians are still catching up to the reality of assisted dying being legal in this country, and now we are foolishly pressing forward before we can fully understand the impacts of this legalization. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067569">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which proposes amendments to the Criminal Code's medical assistance in dying regime, in response to the Superior Court of Quebec's Truchon decision. I will provide the context for the change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067570">As we know, in September 2019, the Superior Court of Quebec struck down the federal and Quebec criteria that limit the access to MAID based on circumstances where death is reasonably foreseeable. The court, whose ruling only applies in Quebec, suspended its declaration of invalidity for six months, until March 11, 2020. On February 17, the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> filed a motion to request a four-month extension to give Parliament the time needed to implement a response and ensure that the law across the country is consistent as it relates to the federal MAID regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067571">I will provide a brief overview of the amendments to the Criminal Code that are being proposed under Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067572">First, on the eligibility criteria, the bill would repeal the reasonably foreseeable natural death criteria and exclude persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness. Second, with regard to safeguards, the bill would create two sets of safeguards, depending on whether a person's death is reasonably foreseeable, while easing some existing safeguards and adding new ones for persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable. Finally, the bill proposes to allow for a waiver of final consent on the day of the procedure in specific circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067573">How did these changes materialize? The development of this legislation was informed by the Truchon decision; available Canadian and international reports, such as the December 2018 report of the Council of Canadian Academies; the experience of existing international regimes; and our government's recent consultation on MAID, held in January and early February.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067574">The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation>, along with their parliamentary secretaries, hosted several federal MAID round tables across the country. These events were attended by experts and stakeholders, including doctors, nurse practitioners, representatives from health regulatory bodies, legal experts, representatives of the disability community, indigenous representatives and other key stakeholders. They shared their experience and insight into MAID and its implementation in Canada over the last four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067575">In parallel to these efforts, our government heard from over 300,000 Canadians who participated in the online public survey on MAID between January 23 and 27, 2020. There was an unprecedented number of respondents, reflecting the significance of this issue for Canadians. This kind of input is invaluable to government and, I am certain, was seriously considered by the ministers in the development of the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067576">I would like to provide a personal perspective on the issue of MAID in its previous iteration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067577">In 2015, when the Liberal government came to power, it was tasked by the Supreme Court to amend MAID. A special joint committee was established, involving both Houses and all parties. The special joint committee conducted an enormous amount of consultation and came up with a proposal. The then minister of justice and minister of health were presented with this proposal. Through intense discussions and consultations, the proposal was amended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067578"> In my riding of Don Valley East, I did a consultation in the sanctuary of the Donway Covenant United Church. Various constituents, as well as other members from across Toronto, participated in the town hall. Members of CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, were also on the panel. It was an emotional meeting. I clearly remember one of my constituents, who was non-verbal and had to use her communication board, telling me that she wanted advance directives while she was lucid but could not predict whether she would be lucid in the foreseeable future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067579">In 2019, I had to do another presentation at a church in another riding. Here, overwhelmingly the audience was against the phrase “foreseeable future” and also wanted advance directives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067580">I am glad to see that some of the changes requested through consultations have now been incorporated. I look forward to the five-year review that is scheduled for June 2020 to see the discussions around advance directives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067581">I will now go to the bill itself and some of the changes it proposes to the eligibility criteria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067582">With regard to the proposed Criminal Code amendments in relation to eligibility, the bill proposes to make two changes to the current set of eligibility criteria for MAID. First, it would repeal the reasonable foreseeability of natural death criteria from the list of eligibility criteria in response to the Truchon ruling. That is good news for some of my constituents in Don Valley East. The legal effect of this amendment would be that those whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable and those whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable would be eligible for MAID if they met all other eligible criteria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067583">Second, the bill proposes to exclude people whose sole underlying medical condition is mental illness. Many practitioners, stakeholders and experts have identified increased complexities regarding individuals seeking MAID whose sole underlying condition is mental illness. I suggest that this could be an item for Parliament to look at it in its upcoming mandatory five-year review of the MAID regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067584">The Council of Canadian Academies' experts group issued a report in 2018 on the same issue and could not come to a consensus on this question. The Government of Quebec has also announced that access to MAID for cases where mental illness is the sole underlying condition would be suspended and that a broad consultation process would be conducted on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067585">Regarding safeguards, the public needs to know some of the safeguards that will protect the vulnerable. With respect to the applicable safeguards proposed, the proposed Criminal Code amendment would create two different sets of safeguards depending on whether a person's natural death is expected in the near term or not. The first set of safeguards would continue to be tailored to persons who have a reasonably foreseeable death where risks are reduced. The second set of safeguards would be tailored to persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable and would address the elevated risks associated with the diverse sources of suffering and vulnerability that could lead a person who is not nearing death to seek access to MAID, such as loneliness, isolation, lack of adequate supports and hopelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067586">Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes to use the reasonable foreseeability of natural death standard to determine which set of safeguards applies to a particular case. This standard would also determine whether a person who is assessed and approved for MAID but who risks dying before the day of the procedure can give consent in advance. I will be discussing that proposal shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067587">How will these safeguards be applied? Specifically, it would require that a MAID request be witnessed by one independent witness instead of two, and it would allow individuals who are paid to provide either health or personal care to act as an independent witness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067588">On the advance consent or directives, the bill proposes amendments that would allow people who have a reasonably foreseeable natural death, and who have been assessed and approved for MAID, to retain their ability to receive MAID if they lose the capacity to consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067589">The bill represents a significant paradigm shift in Canada's legal landscape with regard to medical assistance in dying. I call on members to support this important legislation and send it to committee for further review.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067603">Madam Speaker, during this debate time, we have an opportunity as legislators to ensure that we carefully and thoughtfully examine Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> with the best interests of Canadians in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067604">On September 11, 2019, the Superior Court of Quebec found that it was unconstitutional to limit access to medical assistance in dying to people nearing the end of life. Although the current bill before the House, Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, responds to the court's ruling, it goes far beyond the scope of Quebec's decision and it weakens the important safeguards that have been put in place under Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067605">Since the Liberals put this legislation forward, I have heard from hundreds of my constituents in a matter of days. They have shared with me that they are very concerned about the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067606"> I will use my time today to share a number of the concerns they have raised and to issue a thoughtful word of caution to this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067607">First, there is a parliamentary review of the original legislation scheduled for June. The question has to be asked. Why are we rushing to expand the scope of the current legislation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067608">We are literally discussing life and death issues. Death, something so final, deserves just a little of our time, our attention and due diligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067609">The government's original legislation went through a very lengthy consultation process. This time, however, the consultation only lasted a couple of weeks. That is not the sole concern I have. In addition to that, when I look at this survey, the questions that were asked were quite vague and the multiple choice answers that were provided were drafted in such a way that the party in power could interpret those answers to the secure findings it desired. It was unclear and therefore unhelpful, if we really are going to respect the voices of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067610">However, the fact that this survey was so unhelpful goes to show that the current government was not interested in hearing from Canadians. The current government was interested in pushing through its agenda and therefore being able to twist and manipulate the survey data to its end, which is absolutely wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067611">It is wrong, because it goes against the very essence of this place, which is 338 common people representing common people. This place exists for us to deliberate the issues that matter most in our country and to speak up on behalf of Canadians. Unfortunately, what we have before us is a bill that represents the Liberal agenda rather than the voices of the Canadian people. This is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067612">With legislation of this magnitude, I would urge the members of the House to slow the process down, to consult extensively and for us to come back to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067613">I cannot think of another responsibility we carry as legislators that is more crucial, more obligatory than our duty to protect the most vulnerable in Canadian society. Therefore, we have to take every effort to alleviate any possibility for abuse or misuse based on what is in this bill or based on what is left out of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067614"> My Conservative colleagues have raised many concerns and have given multiple examples where extreme liberties have been taken with physician-assisted suicide where there are looser restrictions in place. I do not wish to rehash all those examples here today, but I certainly will draw the House's attention to a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067615"> Sadly, members across the floor have disregarded many of those examples provided by my Conservative colleagues. They have suggested that the differing jurisdictions and rules should deem these cases irrelevant in this place.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6067616">We have the opportunity and even the duty to learn from other countries and the way they have legislated, to learn from cases within our own country and to make changes that are necessary to properly protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067617">It is undeniable that as one's medical condition progresses, the individual inevitably become more vulnerable. It is our responsibility to stand up for the vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067618">Individuals could lose their ability to speak, to move autonomously or they could lack the coherent and cognitive ability to be able to interact correctly. When an individual reaches this state, this is precisely when the safeguards around MAID, medical assistance in dying, should be strong enough to keep them safe rather than weak enough to make them vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067619">The proposed change in the bill would allow for advanced directive, which takes away the need for the patient to consent immediately before having medical assistance in dying administered. This proposed change is alarming and dangerous as well to the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067620">When we are faced with difficult physical ailments, they often fluctuate in intensity and as they do, our decision-making ability shifts. Think for example about people who are suffering from terminal cancer. They have been advised by medical professionals that their quality of life is likely to deteriorate to a certain degree by a specific date. Let us say that does not happen. Those cancer patients who want to avoid unnecessary pain have already given the date on which their lives will be terminated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067621">Changes take place. What if the diagnosis the doctor gave was not right? What if those patients have actually faired much better? Health care professionals could in fact euthanize these individuals at any point without needing to obtain consent immediately before death is administered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067622">This should concern all of us because of the vulnerability that is in place here. There should be a requirement for contemporaneous consent. We cannot allow one's former self to dictate the will of his or her present self. Minds change, circumstances change, so final consent is an absolute necessity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067623">This example has been raised in the House at least once before, but it is worth raising again because it is close to home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067624"> Taylor Hyatt is a staffer on the Hill. I had the opportunity to interact with her personally. She has a linguistics degree from Carleton University. She lives on her own and she loves her life. Taylor has cerebral palsy and is restricted to a wheelchair. She lives an incredible life and contributes to Canadian society in a multitude of ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067625">Two years ago Taylor went to the hospital because she was feeling quite ill. The doctors did some tests and they said that whatever it was it really was affecting her breathing, and if it came to it, should they administer oxygen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067626"> Taylor was quite surprised at the question. Of course she would want oxygen, that seems like a very basic thing. It is not like it was life support or something that people often take, those decisions of that magnitude, quite seriously. It was the simple administration of oxygen. A few seconds later, the doctor asked "Are you sure?", and he said it in such a way that he was actually applying pressure on her to reconsider her decision, as if to say that her life lacked the value that she felt it had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067627">That is atrocious. If we are sending that message to the most vulnerable in our society, then what have we become?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067628"> I would like to also address one other thing, and that is the need for palliative care. If we are going to talk about administering death to Canadians, then why are we not having a conversation around long-term care? If we are going to talk about the dignity of a human life, then what about those who want to live a dignified life right up until their last breath?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067629"> Why is the government not moving forward with the plan it promised to put in place with regard to palliative care? Why is it not spending the money that needs to be spent on preserving the dignity of those who wish to choose this type of death? These are essential questions with which the House must wrestle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067630">I would caution those within this place to take a step back, because we want our country to be one that supports all people.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067631">Madam Speaker, I thank the member opposite for her contributions. I will clarify on a couple of points and then I will ask the member a question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067632">The first point the member raised was about looking at other jurisdictions. We have done exactly that. We evaluated this regime against every jurisdiction that permits medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067633">With respect to the member's point that changes have been made that were not needed by Truchon, this is both a less restrictive regime and also a more restrictive regime, depending on whether a person's prospect of death is reasonably foreseeable. In the context of whether there are increased procedural safeguards, when someone's death is not approaching imminently, there is a 90-day assessment period and also a period in which an expert doctor must be involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067634">The member opposite expressed considerable concern with respect to the advance consent regime and the Audrey Parker amendment, as it is colloquially known. Is the member willing to address the fact that failing to amend this legislation and address the concerns in terms of Audrey Parker actually leads to premature deaths such as Audrey Parker's, which is a violation of section 7, according to the jurisprudence?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067635">Madam Speaker, I once again would caution this House. If we are going to talk about advance consent, that is one thing; but if we are going to remove the need to give final consent to the issuance of death, that is another thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067636">We are talking about an individual who is going to have his or her life ended. That is very final. It might be good for the medical practitioner to ask the question as to whether that patient is sure that it is indeed what he or she wants in that moment. This is common sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067637">I actually take offence at the question from the member opposite, because it is an incredible degradation of human life.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067641">Madam Speaker, before this House is a piece of legislation having to do with medical assistance in dying. This process has been discussed for the last four and a half years. Of course, there was legislation put in place, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, in 2016. That legislation allowed for medical assistance in dying in Canada. That is covered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067642">My question is this: Where are the millions of dollars that were promised for palliative care? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067643">To the hon. member's point, this country exists on the precedent that there is choice, but if people have the choice for euthanasia, then where is the choice to live until their last breath in a place where they are cared for and where they are pain-free? That is called palliative care, and the current government has failed to deliver on that. By not doing so, it has actually forced a number of people to choose euthanasia when they would not normally choose that, but because their pain levels are so high and because palliative care is not offered, they choose death. </ParaText>

When she points out that the government is making changes that were not demanded by the courts, I would like to point out that there are many Canadians and Canadian families who are dealing with issues of intolerable suffering at the end of life who are asking for changes like Audrey's amendment, and they are asking for them right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067646">As I mentioned earlier, because this debate is going on today, I have had someone I know quite well contact me to say they wish this bill would move quickly because it would assist them in making a choice in maintaining their control at the end of their life. They are facing intolerable suffering that cannot be alleviated.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6067650">This bill represents a major improvement and reflects some of the amendments that I made but that failed in the House, in the 42nd Parliament. Some of those amendments, in fact, were picked up and approved by the Senate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067651">I want to stop and reflect on the trajectory of this issue in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067652">As identified when I rose in my place, I am a member of Parliament for Saanich—Gulf Islands and I believe that Saanich—Gulf Islands may have more constituents concerned with and calling for medical assistance in dying than perhaps any other riding in Canada. There are two active death-with-dignity groups within my community, one on Salt Spring Island and one on the Saanich Peninsula, and I think it is for a very simple reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067653">Feelings run high, and honestly, my constituents persuaded me in 2011 and 2012 that I had to stand up for ensuring that there was access to medical assistance in dying and stand up for removing the Criminal Code punishments for people who, motivated by compassion and basic human dignity, assisted someone who was dealing with unbearable suffering in their last days and weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067654">The reason that my community is so very implicated in this issue is that Sue Rodriguez was a resident of North Saanich. She was unable to take her own life due to the effects of ALS, but she was able to find a doctor, who remains anonymous to this day, who assisted her in ending her own life.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6067655">It is clear that many people in my riding support the measures in Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, as they did supported Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in the previous Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067656">This is about helping to alleviate suffering through medical assistance in dying. This difficult and very serious situation is unfair to anyone.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6067657">Sue Rodriguez went to court, so it is also a trajectory of court cases. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 1993 against Sue Rodriguez. She was suffering from ALS. ALS runs as a thread through what I want to talk about today. Sue was losing ability and had lost ability to speak, to swallow and to walk. We know the trajectory of ALS. She asked the court to change the law and she was unsuccessful. That was in 1993. By the way, it was a very close decision. It was five to four, a very close decision. She died a year later, on February 12, 1994.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067658">Then we take it to 22 years later. That is how slowly the laws evolve. It takes a while. The Supreme Court of Canada and the laws of Canada evolve to meet the changing circumstances. I think part of the reason is that we also realize now, unlike 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, that we can prolong lives and sufferings through miracle advancements in medical science, but before we passed this law in the 42nd Parliament, we were denying people death with dignity and the ability to control their own decision-making about the timing of their own death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067659">Along came the Carter decision, finally, in 2015. Twenty-two years after the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Rodriguez, we had the decision in Carter. I felt very strongly when we debated the bill for medical assistance in dying in this place in the last Parliament, the 42nd Parliament, that our legislative efforts fell far short of what the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Carter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067660">I felt quite sure, and said many times in this place, that the legislation we were passing, while an improvement, would not stand up to legal scrutiny and would be ruled unconstitutional by the courts. Now we have the decision that came out last September in the Truchon case, and again a court has given us a deadline to come up with an improvement. It is being called Audrey's amendment. Certainly a lot of people have identified with that situation, and their hearts have been broken by knowing that medical assistance in dying was out of the reach of people who were suffering gravely but feared they would not be able to form the required consent on the day of the procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067661">I think the bill before us is a substantial improvement, and it really reflects on how courts grapple with this issue and how society grapples with it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067662">I have to say that in the 42nd Parliament, I found the debate remarkably respectful. Across all parties, we recognized that these are serious matters of life and death, not to be trifled with and not to be turned into partisan debate. The reality is that in this legislation we do make amends for some mistakes in the previous bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067663"> I always find it rather odd that we have to find that a person's natural death is “reasonably foreseeable”. I do not think any of us in this place fancy ourselves immortal. All of our deaths are entirely foreseeable; we just do not know exactly the time and place in which they will occur. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067664">Doctors of those who are suffering from a terminal illness are not even able to say the reasonably foreseeable date. What does it mean to be reasonably foreseeable? We put people in a stricture where even if they knew they had a terminal illness, such as ALS, they could not necessarily get aid from this legislation and they could not necessarily give advance consent to a doctor to indicate that they did not want to go through what they knew lay ahead of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067665">One of my best friends emailed earlier today to ask me to stand up and fight this bill, because she is dying with ALS and she did not think the bill would cover her. I spoke to the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> to confirm that I was reading the bill correctly and that, yes, they were thinking specifically of people with ALS. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067666">Our friend who used to sit in that chair, Mauril Bélanger, was lost to us so quickly through ALS. My friend, who is losing the ability of speech, is in a chair and has tubes in her stomach that cause enormous pain. She knows that her lungs will give out, so she is emailing me while we are having this debate. I was really relieved to talk to the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and realize that I am reading the bill correctly, that my friend can get the help that is needed to be assessed and be able to say that she wants consent in advance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067667">However, I do think that there are some areas for amendments that should be made here, and I wish we had more time. I hope the court will give us the additional four months, but we do not know that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067668">Some of the bogeymen that have been raised here today I think are considered in the bill. We do have the requisite safeguards to keep vulnerable people safe. No one can give permission for medical assistance in dying other than the patients themselves. They still have to meet very tight criteria. They have to have a sworn witness. They have to have a doctor.

              <ParaText id="6067688">This bill was introduced in response to a ruling made September 11, 2019, where the Superior Court of Quebec found, in Truchon versus the Attorney General of Canada, that it was unconstitutional to limit access to medical assistance in dying to people nearing the end of life.</ParaText>

It creates two sets of safeguards that must be respected before medical assistance in dying may be provided, which differ in application depending on whether death is reasonably foreseeable. It also creates an advance directive wherein a medical practitioner can proceed with assisted suicide without consent immediately before administering it, assuming all other criteria are met and the patient enters into an arrangement in writing with a medical practitioner or a nurse practitioner to cause death on a specified day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067694">While these changes are significant, it is the other things where I will focus most of my attention. In responding to Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in the last Parliament and now to this bill, it has always been our priority, on this side of the House, to ensure that legislation permitting euthanasia and assisted suicide includes safeguards for the most vulnerable in our society, as well as for the conscience rights of physicians and allied health professionals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067695">Of all the proposed changes, I am most concerned about the removal of the 10-day waiting period. This was not a change mandated by Truchon. Rather, it is a deliberate choice by the Liberal government to strike down one of the most important safeguards for vulnerable people facing uncertain medical prognoses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067696">Nearly every one of us can think of someone in their lives, perhaps a friend, a grandparent or even a spouse, who has received a serious diagnosis.

              <ParaText id="6067697">I am sure many of us can also think of people we know who have received terminal diagnoses and went on to beat their illness and live for years afterwards. However, with the safeguard of a 10-day waiting period gone, such stories may be fewer and farther between.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067698">Without having to take the time to come to terms with their situation, to speak to their families and to learn about treatment options from their doctors, many people will make emotional decisions based on fear. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067730">We also heard how the legislation is working from many of the conscientious health care providers involved in delivering this service. Canadians are engaged and aware of the importance of bringing the compassionate, sensible measures contained within Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code (medical assistance in dying).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067731">This bill builds on the foundation laid by the current legislation on MAID, passed by Parliament in June 2016, and extends eligibility for MAID to persons who, while suffering intolerably, may not be at the end of life. This bill respects the Truchon decision and supports the autonomy of Canadians wanting to make an informed choice to end the suffering they face as a result of serious illness, regardless of whether their condition is life-threatening in the near term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067732">Respecting the autonomy of Canadians while protecting the safety of vulnerable people remains our central objective. That is why Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes a two-track approach to safeguards, based on whether or not a person's death is reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067733">We have proposed to ease certain safeguards that had the unintended consequence of creating a barrier for someone accessing MAID whose death is deemed reasonably foreseeable, and we will introduce new and modified safeguards for eligible persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067734">Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> would permit the waiving of final consent for persons at the end of life who have been already assessed and approved to receive MAID, but who are at risk of losing their decision-making capacity before it can be provided. There was very strong support for this type of amendment from Canadians, experts, health care providers and their professional regulating bodies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067735">Our government recognizes the importance of data and science-based evidence in the decision-making process. That is why this bill proposes that we expand data collection through the federal monitoring regime to provide a more complete picture of MAID in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067736">I would like to note that following the Truchon decision there has been widespread speculation about the potential for persons solely with mental illness to be eligible for MAID. However, many stakeholders in the mental health community have expressed deep concern about this possibility. They feel this option directly conflicts with important treatment principles, which are that there is always hope for recovery and that people can live fulfilling lives with a mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067737">From the perspective of many health care providers and many health care specialists, assessing eligibility for such individuals poses numerous challenges. Mental illnesses are not generally considered to be incurable, which is a requirement under the current law. In addition, the trajectory of such conditions can be more difficult to predict. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067738">In light of the multiple challenges we heard and the lack of support from the practitioner community who would bear the responsibility for conducting eligibility assessments, this bill does not permit MAID for persons whose sole medical condition is a mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067739">This decision was not taken lightly. It in no way implies that suffering associated with mental illness is any less severe or more tolerable than that associated with another medical condition, such as one arising from a physical condition. Rather, this decision reflects the many uncertainties underlying this question and a concern that allowing MAID in these circumstances could place Canadians at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067740">We recognize that there are proponents who support MAID eligibility for persons solely with a mental illness. However, in light of the Quebec court decision and the compressed time frame for legislative amendments, there is insufficient time to fully address this topic and determine whether a regime that allows access to MAID for persons whose sole underlying condition is a mental illness is viable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067741">For these reasons, we are adopting an incremental and cautious approach. It is our view that this issue should be explored as part of the parliamentary review process, which is expected to begin later this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067742">It is easy as parliamentarians and as legislators to lose the human element of what we do and to focus on talking points and politics, but these compassionate and sensible measures have come from extensive consultation with Canadians, experts and folks who have lived with the unintended consequences of the original legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067743">These are folks like the late Audrey Parker, a Nova Scotian who wanted to spend just one last Christmas with her family but ended her life through MAID two months prior, while she could still give consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067744">I want to take this time to read some of Audrey Parker's final posts into the record so they will be preserved in Hansard, because this legislation includes her amendment. As my colleagues in the House debate, discuss and study the bill, I want them to remember that there are many folks like Audrey across Canada who deserve this autonomy and this compassion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067751"> “As I near my death today, it is even more evident than ever before, that late stage consent has got to be amended and removed from MAID in Canada for my category of end users.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067763">Madam Speaker, obviously this debate engages all of our emotions and often from both sides. We have heard the testimony that the member shared. I shared in my speech a story of a woman who had her life taken in very sketchy circumstances. It was at a hospice in Vancouver, where someone took that person's life and said it was based on a demand for euthanasia and that the testimony was based on her own notes, but there had been no consultation with, or awareness by, the local staff. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067773">Madam Speaker, all of the speeches in the House come from a great place. On my side of the House we value life, and that is meritorious. We have heard other perspectives that talk about ending suffering and that truly has merit, so I appreciate all of the speeches that have taken place on such an important topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067774">I know members have gone over this, but just for clarity I want to go over the background for medically assisted suicide in Canada. The 2015 Carter case was a landmark decision for the Supreme Court of Canada. The previous prohibition for assisted suicide was challenged as contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In a unanimous decision, the court abolished the provision in the Criminal Code, thereby giving mentally competent Canadians who were suffering intolerably the right to medical assistance in dying when they had provided clear consent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067775">In June 2016, the first legislation on medical assistance in dying was passed in Canada's Parliament. In the recent 2019 Truchon decision, the Superior Court of Quebec considered the constitutionality and Quebec's requirements in accessing MAID. The plaintiffs in the Truchon case were suffering from grave and incurable medical conditions that were causing tremendous suffering and a total loss of autonomy. However, they had each been refused MAID under the legislation in Quebec and federally. Because they were not at the end of life for the Quebec legislation and federally, death was not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067776">Madam Justice Baudouin held that “reasonably foreseeable natural death” in the federal provisions infringed the plaintiff's fundamental rights under sections 7 and 15 of the charter. The court declared the impugned provisions unconstitutional. In a surprising and, in my mind, incorrect decision, the government chose not to challenge this decision, thereby getting guidance from higher courts such as the Supreme Court. By not challenging this legislation, the Liberal government was admitting that the legislation the House passed was deeply flawed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067777">The court's decision in Truchon gave the government until March 2020, which is now in the process of being extended, to amend the legislation to remove the reasonable foreseeability of death criteria from the MAID legislation. Prior to the introduction of this bill, the government conducted a narrow consultation process, limiting its consultations to urban centres and online surveys. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067778">The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> noted several times, in his address to the House, that the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> were the result of this process. However, he will not share that consultation with Parliament. This lack of respect is disheartening, and counterproductive to open and meaningful dialogue. I wish the government would stop playing games with such important topics and share the information it has with this minority Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067779">Given that there is a limited timeline, that we are in a minority Parliament, and that MAID legislation will be subject to a complete review this summer, I would have expected the government to take a limited approach. Rather, the government has chosen to take a very different approach. The legislation makes substantial changes to the MAID eligibility far and beyond what is required to the Truchon decision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067781">Madam Speaker, this is a bit frustrating because I have asked the same question of the government so many times. I hope I will be clear enough as to give the government no excuse this time. Hopefully I will actually get some degree of an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067782">My question is why the government has not listed the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, a terrorist entity and if it is still the policy of the government to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067783">I will give a quick historical background on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067784"> Approaching two years ago, we passed in the House a motion to list the IRGC as a terrorist entity. That motion passed with the support of all members of the Conservative caucus and all members of the Liberal caucus, at least all those who were present. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and other leading ministers, such as the former ministers of public safety, foreign affairs, etc., were part of that vote and voted in favour of listing the IRGC as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067785">In fact, the motion did not just say to list the IRGC, it said to do so immediately. The Conservatives followed up immediately. We told the government that it voted for a motion and that the House of Commons had expressed its desire to immediately list the IRGC as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code. We had asked for it to be done immediately and the government had agreed. We asked what the government would do about it. The government said that it would think about it, would study it and that the process was under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067786">We understood there was a process that could take a month, two months or three months. It is not really plausible that it is approaching two years after the fact. Surely the listing process does not take that long. In fact, there have been cases where terrorist entities that have existed for less time have managed to be listed in a much shorter period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067787">The typical response, and maybe the response we will hear from the government tonight, is to usually talk about other things that have been done on human rights related to Iran. The government will not say that all those things are continuations of things that were done under the Harper government, but nonetheless it will point to those things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067788">The government will say that the IRGC Quds Force, which is part of the IRGC, is listed. Again, that was an action taken by the Harper government, not by the current government. The Quds Force is still listed as a terrorist entity. However, the motion that passed, approaching two years ago, was not to list the Quds Force. It was already listed. The motion was to list the IRGC in its entirety and to do so immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067789">Maybe tonight will be the night. Maybe we will not hear the smoke and mirrors of it still being in process. It is going to be in process for another 50 years. Hopefully we will not hear this “still in process” nonsense. Hopefully the government will not just remind us about the Quds Force, which is already listed, has been for a long time and is not the topic here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067790">Hopefully the government will answer the question. Is it still the policy of the government to list the IRGC? Is there a reason the government did not list the IRGC earlier, and why? What is its intention with regard to the listing of the IRGC? It should be a simple question. It has been asked over and over again in question period and late shows. Hopefully now is the time we get an answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067791">Is it still the policy of the government to list the IRGC, why has it not done it yet and does it plan to do it in the future?</ParaText>

The plane was carrying 176 people when it crashed, and all of those on board were killed, including 57 Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067793">After initially denying its responsibility, Iran has since admitted that it unintentionally shot down the plane. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, there will be much thought given to the potential consequences in the course of the coming weeks. For now, we are seeking full clarity on the circumstances that led to such a horrific tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067794">The downing of flight 752 has brought renewed focus to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC. Canada continues to have in place a series of strong measures to hold both Iran and the IRGC accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067795">In June 2019, Canada added three new Iran-backed groups to the list: Al-Ashtar Brigades, Harakat al-Sabireen and Fatemiyoun Division. Iran provides these three groups with substantial resources, including training and weapons to carry out terrorist acts that advance its goals in the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067796">The Al-Ashtar Brigades, or AAB, aims to overthrow Bahrain's monarchy and targets Bahraini security forces primarily through the use of improvised explosive devices. Canada is not alone in designating AAB. In 2017, AAB was listed by the U.K., and the U.S. designated it as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067797">Harakat al-Sabireen, or HaS, is an Iranian-backed Shia group that supports the destruction of Israel. HaS was founded and is led by a former leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is itself a listed entity in Canada. Members of HaS fight against Israel alongside Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The U.S. designated HaS in 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067798">Finally, the Fatemiyoun Division, or FD, is supported and trained by the Quds Force and Hizballah. It serves as part of the Iran-backed forces fighting in Syria and has a presence in Afghanistan. FD is also known to have used Afghan children as child soldiers. In January 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the FD for providing material support to Iran's Quds Force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067799">Canada continues to list the IRGC-Quds Force and a number of terrorist entities that have benefited from the force's patronage, including arms, funding and paramilitary training, and who help advance Iran's interests and foreign policy. These include Hizballah, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067800">We have imposed sanctions on Iran and the IRGC, as well as on senior members of its leadership under the Special Economic Measures Act. The regulations explicitly target the IRGC and several sub-organizations, including the IRGC air force and air force missile command. Iran also continues to be designated as a state supporter of terrorism under Canada's State Immunity Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067801">The member can be assured that Canada is looking at all possible options to constrain the activities of Iran that threaten national security.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067802">Madam Speaker, that response clearly demonstrates how uninterested the government is in engaging in a serious response to a serious and important question about foreign affairs and national security. We gave the opportunity to the minister, the parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs or the parliamentary secretary for public safety to respond to the question, and we have the great fog read out of policy detail that in no way engages with a very simple and clear question. It is not as if the government did not have advance notice of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067803">Members know the way these late shows work: The government knows a long time in advance that the question is going to be asked and exactly what the question is going to be. Again and again we ask the same question, and not only has the government not bothered to answer, but the foreign affairs and public safety teams could not even be bothered to show up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067804">Again, this is a simple question: Why did the government not list the IRGC as a terrorist entity? Does it still intend to list the IRGC? If the answer is no, it should just tell us no. The House deserves an answer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067805">Madam Speaker, this listing of regime is an important tool for countering terrorism in Canada and globally, and it is part of the government's commitment to keeping Canadians safe. Listing is just one component of the international and domestic response to terrorism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067806">With that in mind, I would reiterate that Canada has already taken action against Iran and the IRGC specifically, including listing the IRGC Quds Force. These actions are broadly consistent with our international partners, who have designated components of the IRGC under their own sanctioned regimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067807"> This past June we listed three militant groups that are aligned with, and controlled by, the Quds Force and operating in Bahrain, the Gaza strip, Syria and Afghanistan. A listing imposes severe penalties for people and organizations that deal with property or finances of a listed entity. Another important point is, of course, that once listed, an entity falls within the definition of a terrorist group in the Criminal Code. This helps to facilitate the laying of terrorism-related charges against perpetrators and supporters of terrorism.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067808">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067809">I have said before and I will say again that, when I was appointed by the leader of the official opposition as the shadow minister for ethics, I told the leader, and I have told folks who have asked, that I hoped to be the most bored in the shadow cabinet, that I would not have any work to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067810">Regrettably, the government has demonstrated through its top-down model of disregard for the rules, not only of this place but the rules writ large, that we seem to find ourselves constantly following up on the ethical violations of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his cabinet members and his backbenchers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067811">I had the opportunity to ask a question in the House a few weeks ago about former member Joe Peschisolido, who was found guilty of having broken the conflict of interest code. The code is laid out in such a way that it is very easy for us to follow. The purpose of the code, as colleagues know, is so that Canadians can continue to have confidence in their elected officials and have confidence in public institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067812">When we, as the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation> did, forget to disclose that we have a French villa, for example, Canadians find that a bit incredible to believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067813"> Madam Speaker, when you and I filled out our disclosures, I do not think that we paused too long on the French villa box. You and I both know how many French villas we have, as I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067814">In Mr. Peschisolido's case, he failed to disclose a wide range of things. I encourage interested Canadians to take a look at that. I also encourage the government to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067815">The response I got from the government when I asked the government House leader was that, “Oh, that member is no longer a member of our caucus, so we don't know how it has anything to do with us.” That speaks to the culture that exists in the government benches. That speaks to what we have seen with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> twice being found guilty of breaking the Conflict of Interest Act, which is also in place to ensure that Canadians can have confidence in their executive, the Prime Minister and his or her ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067816">Whether it is the SNC-Lavalin scandal, clam scam or forgotten French villas, we have seen this litany of ethical breaches with the government. Most recently, again on the subject of disclosures, we make these disclosures to the commissioner with regard to members' personal dealings so that we can make sure members aren't being unduly influenced financially in a pecuniary manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067817">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> just did not answer the questionnaire. He is required to do so. He did not do it. In response, when he was called out on it, it was an administrative oversight. A week later, the Ethics Commissioner published who had failed to file their disclosures. Canada's <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s name appeared again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067818">When will the government start taking the confidence that Canadians have put in them seriously? Do they need any help following those rules?</ParaText>

He stated, “Where I conclude that a Member has contravened the Code and I find no mitigating circumstances, as was the case in this inquiry,” as the member referenced, “I may recommend a sanction for the House to impose on the contravening Member. However, in the present case, given that Mr. Peschisolido is no longer a Member and therefore not subject to the rules governing Members of the House of Commons, issuing such a recommendation would serve no purpose.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6067823">Madam Speaker, there have been so many days when I have seen that the primary objective of the official opposition was character assassination. Its members will constantly go all out to try to identify an issue as an ethical breach, as if the Conservatives, the New Democrats or any other political party has never done anything wrong. Members need to be careful when they throw stones in glass houses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067824">The member cited how the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> broke the code of ethics. We respect what the commissioner ruled on that. Does the member know that the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> did not intentionally do what the member is proposing he did? In the case of that so-called French villa, it was shortly thereafter that the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> had a house in France was published in a major newspaper here in Canada. There was no attempt to intentionally hide it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067825">Yes, sometimes mistakes happen. Members of Parliament on all sides of the House make mistakes, and the commissioner investigates them and comes up with recommendations. To try to give the illusion that there is only one political entity that makes mistakes inside this House is a false impression. There are mistakes made on all sides of the House. When a mistake is made, we need to recognize it and take corrective action. That is what we have seen with this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6067826">If the member wants to talk about proactive measures, I would remind him of the proactive disclosures we made with respect to the allowances of all members back when we were the third party in this House. We had to literally drag the Conservatives into supporting proactive disclosure. This <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this government have taken the responsibility of being open, transparent and accountable very seriously. I would argue that this is something this government has been very good at, especially if we compare it to the Stephen Harper era. We have seen much more open government, transparency and accountability, which was lacking when Stephen Harper was the prime minister.</ParaText>
