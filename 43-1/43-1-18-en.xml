              <ParaText id="6050279">This bill addresses a critical issue, which is the securing of the biosecurity of our food supply, especially when there are trespassers on farm property and facilities. As the House may be aware, there are numerous protests on farm property and process plants across this country, and it is certainly not relegated to one segment of agriculture or one area of Canada. We have seen people enter hog farms in Abbotsford, B.C. and Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, a pork breeding facility in Ontario, and activists have even tried to remove animals from dairy farms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050280">In my own riding of Foothills, a farmer was startled to come to his farm in the morning and see that dozens of protesters had broken into the property and into a barn and were trying to take turkeys. There are numerous examples, and I fear the situation will get worse if producers do not see something is done. I do not think activists understand the full consequences of their actions. We want them to understand that they are endangering the safety of livestock, families, farmers and workers. We understand that they care deeply about the soil, food safety, animal health and the environment, but I think my colleagues in this room would also understand and agree with me that mental health and anxiety within agriculture are at a crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050281">These are important issues that we hope to address, but I have decided to focus my amendment to the Health of Animals Act to create a new offence. The act provides for the control of diseases and toxic substances that may affect animals or could be transmitted by animals to persons. The risks from viruses like the African swine fever are very real and potentially devastating to Canadian agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050282">Currently, there is nothing that addresses trespassers, which is what this bill aims to change. I look forward to engaging with my colleagues as we work together to address this important issue and the safety of Canada's food supply.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050284"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege today to introduce an act to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050285">Agriculture is a pillar of our economy and it is part of the fabric of our society. Agriculture, though, has been having a particularly difficult time. Our farmers are struggling out there. They are now facing multiple blockades in addition to pricing instability and trade disruptions. The pressures on our farmers today are innumerable. Therefore, it is with great satisfaction that I am introducing a private member's bill that would provide some relief to our farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050286">One of the things I heard when I was travelling my riding, from farmers and non-farmers, is that the carbon tax is impacting the way they operate their businesses. In fact, the carbon tax is taking away up to 12% of their net income, so this is having a significant impact. There is currently an exemption for farmers, but only for gasoline and diesel. For whatever reason, both propane and natural gas were left out. That left many grain growers and farmers out in the cold, as they were drying their grain and paying thousands of dollars in carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050287">Our friends in the government like to say that the carbon tax is revenue neutral. However, for farmers that simply is not the case. Their rebate may account for less than 10% of the carbon tax. Many are paying thousands and thousands of dollars in carbon tax every year, making their prices higher and making it more difficult to compete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050288">My private member's bill would allow an increase in the exemption, to include both natural gas and propane, making life just a bit easier and more affordable for our farmers. This would allow farmers to invest in technologies to fight climate change, such as sequestering carbon and other sustainable practices that would make life a bit better for all Canadians.</ParaText>

The petitioners are calling on this House to reject the proposal for a very large expansion, with over 14,000 hectares of wetlands to be lost. Petitioners note that if the expansion goes ahead, it would produce 260,000 barrels of bitumen a day and substantially increase greenhouse gases, blowing through our Paris targets. The petitioners call on this House assembled to reject Teck's Frontier mine and halt any existing or planned construction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050319">As we are talking about the relationship between first nation people, I rise on a question of privilege pursuant to Standing Order 48, to state that I believe my parliamentary privilege was violated by the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and his staff. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050320">It is my belief that the minister and his staff misled the House on a fundamental issue, which is the legal cost of fighting indigenous children at the Human Rights Tribunal and in Federal Court. I consequently believe that, because they have provided this misinformation, the minister should be held in contempt of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050321">We have had a lot of talk this week about the importance of the rule of law. I find this issue especially pertinent when we are talking about the actions of the justice department and the Attorney General, who apparently believe they are above Parliament when it comes to their obligation to respond to Order Paper questions on fundamental questions of fact, not opinions on facts. If you will indulge me, Mr. Speaker, I will present the facts of this case as succinctly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050322">On December 9, 2019, I gave notice pursuant to Standing Order 39 of a written question seeking information regarding the legal fees for the hours and the associated costs the government has incurred due to legal proceedings related to Human Rights Tribunal cases against first nation children between 2007 and 2019. The Department of Justice provided a written response to this question in late January 2020 stating, “Based upon the hours recorded, the total amount of legal costs incurred amounts to approximately $5,261,009.14, as of December 9, 2019.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050323">As a stand-alone figure, the idea that the federal government would have spent $5.2 million fighting the rights of the most vulnerable children in this country is shocking. However, it has come to my attention that these numbers are extremely misleading. I have brought this forward because evidence contrary to the justice official's came out last week when I was representing Canada in Washington, so this is my first opportunity to address this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050324">Ms. Cindy Blackstock, who has been involved in this case from the beginning, has tabled documents she has received through multiple ATIPs from the justice department about the costs incurred between 2007 and 2017. The number Ms. Blackstock has provided, through the justice department's own documents, is $9.4 million spent fighting indigenous children in court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050325">APTN has analyzed the numbers and has come up with a slightly more conservative figure of $8.3 million as of 2017, but that is still substantially higher than what the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> stated the department has spent up until now. This does not include any of the costs incurred after 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050326">I will remind the Speaker that when the government was found guilty of reckless discrimination against first nation children in 2016, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a solemn vow that he would respect the rulings of the Human Rights Tribunal. He said he would address this and would not fight this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050327">However, there have been nine non-compliance orders, as well as a battle in Federal Court attempting to quash the ruling and deny the rights of children who are in the broken child welfare system. It is clear the numbers we have up to 2017 from the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>'s office are higher than $8.3 million and higher than the false $5.2 million he provided through the Order Paper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050328">How can the House make sense of these contradictory numbers? We are not talking about opinions. The issue goes to the heart of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise on reconciliation to create a new relationship based on trust. It must also be based on the trust of parliamentarians, when they use tools like the Order Paper question to get factual responses so they can do their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050329">This ongoing legal battle against first nation children has had a corrosive effect on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s brand and it would appear to me that it cannot be explained away as a matter of opinion attempting to downplay the numbers.</ParaText>

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050354">He said: Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. NDP member for not taking up our entire opposition day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050355">We are hearing about some very serious issues in the news, issues that have been commanding our attention and that will now be debating in the House, and rightly so, as we just agreed. I thank the Speaker for that. However, I am asking members today to make room in their thoughts, hearts and minds for an issue that may, on the surface, appear to be less urgent but that, in its own way, has a serious impact on the lives of tens of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands of Quebeckers and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050356">I would like to tell a little story. A few months ago, I met a Quebecker who told me about the situation being faced by his daughter Émilie Sansfaçon. This woman, who worked and paid EI premiums throughout her entire career, suddenly found herself unable to work. That is the very principle behind what we call insurance. It is an amount that you pay yourself or with others in order to be able to cope with a difficult situation that is hopefully temporary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050357">However, Émilie was being granted only 15 weeks of benefits, when a regular worker employed by a given industry or the government could receive up to 50 weeks of benefits. That is a major problem for someone who has a serious illness, such as cancer, or who had a serious illness and then relapses, which is even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050358">When I met with Louis Sansfaçon, Émilie's father, I was shocked to learn that this discrimination exists. To me, that seemed extremely unfair to people in serious need in our supposedly generous and open society and completely devoid of compassion toward them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050359">We therefore raised the issue in Parliament and organized several meetings, one of which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did us the honour of attending, along with the minister. It emerged from that meeting that the Liberals would consider not only their own election promise of extending benefits from 15 weeks to 26, but also the possibility of extending them from 15 weeks to 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050360">I left the meeting thinking that we had gone from a ceiling of 26 weeks to a floor of 26 weeks, so that what might have been the maximum had become the minimum. The number of weeks would be somewhere between 26 and 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050361">Of course, there is no such thing as “semi-discrimination”. Either there is discrimination or there is not. If an ordinary worker is entitled to 50 weeks, someone who is unable to work for whatever reason should also get 50 weeks. It would be discriminatory to give that person 32 or 41 weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050362">At least we were seeing some openness and some progress. At the time, we agreed that although we were seeing some progress and discussions—and of course things would move more quickly in the lead-up to the budget—we would exercise discretion in a spirit of collaboration, as we always do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050363">Sadly, it did not happen. The reports we are hearing suggest that there is no measure, that the 26 weeks will not necessarily be guaranteed in this budget, and that the 50 weeks will not even be considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050364">By its own analysis, either the government came to the conclusion that this is not a good measure, and I would be curious to know why, or we got taken for a ride. Apparently they wanted to stretch this out, buy some time and see what they will do with this issue later. Obviously, that is not satisfactory to us.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6050365">The government, and particularly the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, is quick to see discrimination everywhere, however it defines it and however imagined. In some situations, there truly is discrimination, but not in every case. In Quebec, we certainly feel the repercussions of comments that we believe are not entirely true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050366">In this case, we have a technical and mathematical issue. People contribute to an independent employment insurance fund and then, one day, find themselves unable to do their job, either because it no longer exists or for a wide range of other reasons. Some of those workers will receive employment insurance benefits for 50 weeks, and others for fewer weeks, which is a clear example of discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050367">I am appealing to the government's real or purported values to ask it to be fair. Fairness means not being discriminatory. Fairness means applying the same rules to everyone. In this case, there are no linguistic, territorial, religious or other variables. We are talking about the ability to work, a foundation of modern western economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050368"> Politicians tend to brag about Canada having a generous social safety net. The primary purpose of the social safety net is to protect the purchasing power of individuals, who in turn support economic activity while successfully maintaining a minimum standard of living and quality of life. In a way, parliamentarians have a solemn duty to protect this 20th century benefit.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050369">In this case, we would tend to say that it is good for some and not so good for others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050370">Naturally we could make the argument about the cost. Still, Canada is not too poor to buy a pipeline, just to mention an arbitrary example. Canada is not too poor to chase a seat on the UN Security Council—which costs millions of dollars—even if it means casually shaking hands with Iran's foreign minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050371">We have the money for lots of things. However, when it comes to the fair implementation of values shared by Canada and Quebec that we consider to be fundamental, we suddenly do not have the money. Clearly, we cannot accept that argument. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050372">The Parliamentary Budget Officer studied the issue. He found that it would cost just over $1 billion annually if all workers with serious illnesses received EI benefits for the entire period of 50 weeks. We know that very few people with an illness preventing them from working will actually be away from their jobs for 15, 25 or 30 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050373">Therefore, the real costs are unknown, but they surely represent less than half the estimated amount. We are talking about amounts that the government readily allocates to matters that could be deemed to be less important. Employment insurance is a fundamental responsibility of the state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050374">This is ultimately all about compassion. Some of us are naturally a little more sensitive than others, while others are a little more ostentatious about it. I would like us to be less ostentatious and to take real action.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6050375">I would like to see us be unanimous, or at least in agreement, about Canada's and Quebec's shared values. I would like to see members stop hiding behind ostensibly economic arguments that may or may not be valid to put off doing the right thing. The government and its leader have expressed values, and I want nothing more than to take them at their word. I encourage them to be clear on their position today and for the vote tomorrow, so that we can put an end to this discrimination that is just as unacceptable as any other form of discrimination. I encourage everyone to show compassion, understanding, justice and fairness to the tens of thousands of people who are suffering in the worst possible way. I believe this to be our fundamental duty, and I urge the House to vote accordingly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050415">As everyone knows, workplaces and families are changing. Naturally, employment insurance sickness benefits need to change as well. The employment insurance system has remained a pillar of Canada's social safety net since it was created in 1940. Since then, life has changed considerably.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050416">It is time to see how employment insurance sickness benefits can better support Canadians. I will first take a moment to describe what the program is currently meant to do and what it is like now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050418">Employment insurance sickness benefits were designed to help Canadians stay connected to the labour market and to provide them with financial support during the healing process. This will allow them to return and contribute to the labour market without having to bear any undue financial hardship. These sickness benefits are in addition to other support measures available in the case of illness or long-term disability through the Canada pension plan disability benefits and employers' health care plans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050419">On average, people who claimed sickness benefits in the fiscal year 2017-18 used 10 weeks of the benefit and then returned to work. However, quite a large cohort, 36% or about 150,000 Canadians, exhausted their full 15 weeks before they could get back to work. Among these 150,000 Canadians, we know that women and older Canadians were more likely to need more than the 15 weeks. This is a very serious issue facing Canadians with sickness or injury.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050423">People are troubled by what they have been witnessing this past week. Young, old, indigenous and newcomers are asking themselves what is happening in the country. They are asking what lies ahead for themselves, for their communities and for Canada. They know that these protests are serious, that this is a critical moment for our country and for our future. So do I.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050424">On all sides, people are upset and frustrated. I get it. It is understandable, because this is about things that matter: rights, livelihoods, the rule of law and our democracy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050425"> To those affected by the blockades and protests, I know that you are going through difficult times. Rest assured that our government is working hard to find a solution. Our government’s priority is to resolve this situation peacefully, but also to protect the rule of law in our country. That is a principle we will always stand up for.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050426">It is past time for this situation to be resolved. However, what we are facing was not created overnight. It was not created because we have embarked upon a path of reconciliation recently in our history. It is because, for too long in our history, for too many years, we failed to do so. Therefore, finding a solution will not be simple; it will take determination, hard work and co-operation. There is no relationship more important to Canada than the one with indigenous peoples. Today, as Prime Minister, I am once again formally extending my hand in partnership and trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050427"> Over the last 11 days, our government has been working on a path forward, even as many have been saying we should give up. We know what is at stake. We know that we cannot afford to fail. Therefore, we are creating a space for peaceful, honest dialogue with willing partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050428">As we heard this morning from Mohawk leaders and from National Chief Perry Bellegarde, we need to resolve this through dialogue and mutual respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050429">To the Wet'suwet'en and Mohawk nations, and indigenous leaders across the country, we are listening. We are not asking that they stop standing up for their communities, rights and for what they believe. We only ask that they be willing to work with the federal government as partners in finding solutions. They remind us, rightly so, that too often trust has been betrayed in the history of indigenous negotiations with Canadian governments. In fact, that underlines the difficulty of solving this situation today. However, our common ground is the desire to arrive at solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050430"> We cannot resolve this alone. Just like we need indigenous leaders to be partners, we also need Canadians to show both resolve and collaboration. Everyone has a stake in getting this right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050431"> Let us be clear. Our government will continue to work night and day to quickly find a peaceful solution. In the past, we have seen just how quickly these situations can change. I know that we all want to find a solution, and at the same time we must prevent things from escalating. I again convened the incident response group yesterday to discuss the situation and our path forward. I have also spoken with premiers across the country about the impact of blockades on farmers, entrepreneurs, families and workers across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050444">In this country, we are facing many important and deep debates, debates about the future livelihoods of our children, the future of our environment, our relations with countries around the world and our positioning on things that are fundamental at a time of anxiety. More and more Canadians are impatient to see those answers. More and more people are frustrated that there is such uncertainty. More and more we see those debates carried with increasing intensity on the margins of our democratic conversations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050445">The place for these debates is here in this House. The place for these debates is around kitchen tables and community centres in the country. Yes, there is always a place for Canadians to protest and express their frustrations, but we need to ensure we also listen to each other. The reality of populism, and its siren song in our democracies these days, is a desire to listen only to ourselves and to people who agree with us and not to people of another perspective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050446">The concern with action before discussion and the need for reasonable, reasoned debate in this place are at the centre of what we have to continue to move forward with as a country. Indigenous rights, climate action, law and order and building a clean economy are things we will not achieve by degrading our democracy. We must be honest about why we are here. We must be open to working together to move forward, not just in the days ahead but as we make progress on everything from implementing indigenous rights and title, addressing historic wrongs and ending long-term drinking water advisories. As a country and as a government, we need to continue the work we are doing and we need to continue to walk this road together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050447">I say to everyone that we are extending our hands in good faith for dialogue. The opportunity is there on the table right now. We are in this together: the worker, the senior, the indigenous leader, the protester and the police officer. Let us have the courage to take this opportunity and take action together to build a better path for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050448">Mr. Speaker, that was the weakest response to a national crisis in Canadian history. I listened to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s word salad just now and at least two key things were missing: a clear denunciation that the actions of these radical activists are illegal and some kind of an action plan that would put an end to the illegal blockades and get our economy back on track. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s statement was a complete abdication of responsibility and of leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050449">We are at an important time in our country's history, a time when we have to decide who and what our country stands for. Will we be a country of “yes”, where big national projects can get built and our country can grow and develop, or will we be a country of “no”, where a few loud voices can shut down development and prosperity for all? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050450">Will our country be one of the rule of the law, or will our country be one of the rule of the mob? Will we let our entire economy be held hostage by a small group trampling the legal system that has governed our country for more than 150 years?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050451">Let me be clear. Standing between our country and prosperity is a small group of radical activists, many of whom have little to no connection to first nations communities. They are a bunch of radical activists who will not rest until our oil and gas industry is entirely shut down. They may have the luxury of not having to go to work every day, and they may have the luxury of not facing repercussions for skipping class, but they are blockading our ports, railways, borders, roads and highways, and they are appropriating an indigenous agenda, which they are willfully misrepresenting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050452">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s elevation of these protesters to the same level as the thousands of men and women in first nations communities across our country who have been trying in good faith to right the wrongs of Canadian history is a disservice to the spirit of reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050453">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has emboldened and encouraged this kind of behaviour by cancelling other big projects based on political considerations instead of science and facts.</ParaText>

Every single elected band council on the Coastal GasLink route supports this project. Even the majority of hereditary chiefs support this project. The vast majority of first nations community members themselves support this project because it will create jobs and it will create opportunities. It will lead to investments in their communities and, in the end, it will help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050455">This is a fantastic opportunity for the Wet'suwet'en people, so why are these radical activists opposing this project? For them this is just a warm-up act. It is a warm-up act for what they consider to be the next fights against Trans Mountain and against Teck Frontier. In the end their goal is to shut down our entire energy industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050456">It is important to remember who the victims of this have been and who have been victimized by Liberal inaction. They are the farmers who cannot get their grain to market. They are the small business owners who cannot get their shipments in time. They are the homeowners who may face trouble getting their home heating fuel for the winter. They are the workers facing layoffs. The ultimate victims are the Wet'suwet'en members themselves who are looking for prosperity for their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050457">Conservatives have been calling for common sense and appropriate recommendations to end these illegal blockades. We have called on the Liberal government to enforce the rule of law. What we were expecting today was some sort of an announcement about a plan that would put an end to these illegal blockades.

              <ParaText id="6050461">Mr. Speaker, I must clarify what the Conservative leader means when he uses the phrase “this side of the House”. We sit on the same side of the House, but clearly, no member of the Bloc Québécois would ever take sides within a first nation, calling some people bad guys and others good guys, depending on whether they agree with the Bloc. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050463">Furthermore, I have to ask the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> why it took him 12 days to intervene when it was clear from the very beginning that this would be a serious national crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050464">Also, why do I feel like I just heard an election speech from 2015? We heard statements about all sorts of highly laudable values, principles and virtues, but with nothing concrete behind them. I understand that negotiations must happen somewhere. I understand that open lines of communication are needed. I understand that the Prime Minister does not want to negotiate in public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050465">That is fine, but the government does not convene Parliament to make a ministerial statement if it has nothing to say, and yet, that is what we just witnessed. The way forward does not seem much clearer, but the errors do. First, it seems we have to make a decision. It is almost like we have to choose today in the House between respect for first nations, respect they deserve, and the Canadian economy, as though those two things are automatically and hopelessly irreconcilable. It is almost as if it were impossible to find a solution to the crisis that would get key components of the Quebec and Canadian economies moving again without undermining the talks requested by the first nations. I, for one, think it is possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050466">As a brief aside, I want to once again ask who we are to judge. After all, we are claiming our approach is legitimate based on a law passed in 1876 that imposed a governance model on first nations that stemmed from our great sense of white superiority. Some first nations members are not convinced that this is the best approach. This debate is theirs to some extent. That is mainly what this is about. We are somewhat obligated to respect and listen to first nations. In that respect, I agree with the fact that the government wants to finally have a conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050467">However, there are certainly some existing tensions. Members must remember that, not so long ago, the government either authorized or turned a blind eye to the use of snipers near Wet'suwet'en territory. I can see how that might create some tension. I can see how some people might not feel safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050468">On the heels of that, the message is to avoid going down a path of tension and violence. I could not agree more. That should never have been allowed. We have heard a litany of excuses over the years. This is a good opportunity to apologize for allowing such a thing to happen, which is certainly a fundamental aspect of the current crisis. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050470">I can imagine everyone's relief at the thought that maybe, by their own initiative, there would be conversations, processes or reassurances that would produce the urgently needed result of ending the blockades. Negotiations necessarily involve people reacting to other actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050471"> That is what has to happen. It is also vital to be open to profound, fundamental cultural differences, instead of simply imposing our own values by banging on desks. First nations have the right to be different. I think we need that perspective and restraint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050472">Although the Wet'suwet'en are not unanimously agreed on the issue of the Coastal GasLink pipeline, I think it is important to at least have the wisdom to give them a space where they can have the necessary discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050473">What actions should be taken? I do not have the authority to answer that question, because I am an observer who only speaks for Quebec. However, this crisis is having a serious economic impact on Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050474"> This crisis falls within the purview of British Columbia, and we respect provincial jurisdiction. However, apart from all the otherwise highly commendable speeches and values, I wonder if it might be advisable to seek a complete suspension of the work, if only on a temporary basis. It would then be perfectly legitimate to ask the first nations to dismantle their blockades across Canada and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050475">I think that would be a clear, concrete and measurable action that the first nations could surely interpret as a gesture of genuine openness, one that would go beyond mere words, which have all too often only led to disappointment over the past few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050476">I urge the government to take concrete action and propose a clear, measurable solution that I hope will be well received. I want to reiterate that the methods adopted by the first nations are unacceptable and are harming their own economy as well as the Canadian and Quebec economies as a whole. This issue needs to be resolved quickly and definitively. If that is the government's intention, it can count on our collaboration.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050486">There have been centuries of broken promises to indigenous people, and those broken promises are not just broken words: They have resulted in massive injustice, massive inequality and the deaths of indigenous people. Indigenous people have been denied basic human rights. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to be different, but he broke his promises and did not show himself to be very different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050487">Let us look at his record. The Prime Minister and the Liberal government members talk about their record, so let us look at what is going on in our country right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050488">A Human Rights Tribunal decision found that the government did not just underfund or discriminate against indigenous kids, but did so recklessly, willfully, purposefully. To add insult to injury, the government is taking first nations kids to court and is not even being clear about how many millions of dollars it is spending to fight them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050489">Not only in child welfare has the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government let down first nations, Inuit and Métis, but also when it comes to the funding of education for first nations and the funding of programs. Something as simple as the program to allow women to rightfully reclaim status has been underfunded. There have been massive inconsistencies between what the Prime Minister says and what he does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050490">We are in the year 2020. I can accept no excuse that the Liberal government, coming off of a five-year majority, cannot ensure that every single indigenous community in this country has clean drinking water. With the technology and the wealth of our country, there is no excuse why clean drinking water cannot be assured as a right.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050492">On top of that, when a young activist raised concerns about clean drinking water in a community at a private fundraiser, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> mocked that young person in front of his wealthy donors. That was the response of the Prime Minister and it is part of why this crisis is where it is right now. The Prime Minister said he knew better than elders and that what young indigenous people really need is a place to store their paddles and canoes. That does not show a respect for the seriousness and gravity of the problem that colonialism has left for the first people of this land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050493">On the current issue, more than a month ago the Wet'suwet'en chiefs made a request for the federal government to play a role. They specifically asked for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the federal government to play a role in resolving this conflict. New Democrats asked a question of the government weeks ago. At the time, that question was laughed off. At the time, the Prime Minister said it was not his problem. He said it was “entirely under provincial jurisdiction.” I am glad to see that the Prime Minister now understands that a nation-to-nation relationship means that all levels of government must play a role and that the Prime Minister must play a role as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050494">It is encouraging to see that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not calling for police to be sent in.

              <ParaText id="6050500">Madam Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for giving me this opportunity to speak about this emergency situation that confronts us all with the reality of injustice and the challenge of reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050501">This is a very important debate and this is a very important moment. During the constituency week when I was home in my riding, we discussed the blockades, the inconvenience, what it means for settler culture Canadians to face inconvenience when indigenous people have had their land, children and culture stolen from them, and efforts to annihilate who they are as people. We have to weigh our inconvenience against the challenge of the moment. One of my constituents, Priscilla, said that we should focus on the opportunity of such a rich conversation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050502">Listening to some of the words of my colleagues, the<Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9"> leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> reminded me of something. On May 4, 1877, General Oliver Otis Howard spoke of the frustrations he felt in dealing with the Nez Perce and their chiefs as they discussed what mattered to them. He stated that, “Twenty times over I hear that the earth is your mother. I want to hear it no more, but come to business at once.” This is not simple and it will not end overnight because it is based on a century and a half of injustice, oppression and colonialism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050503">It is also based on the reality that since 1997, the Wet'suwet'en have had every reason to believe that based on a Supreme Court of Canada decision, the federal government would come and talk about the title for the Wet'suwet'en, which could be 22,000 square kilometres, and about what it means that the Supreme Court of Canada has said that their title and indigenous form of government, which predate Canada by thousands of years, have status in Canadian law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050504">We must not ever set out the notion that there is a rule of law on one side and indigenous people on the other. Indigenous people have the law on their side. When the <Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9"> leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> referred to “a small group of radical activists”, perhaps he meant the nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada. They are the ones who said that title is title is title and that indigenous title is collective and intergenerational. Acknowledging that will explain why we stand in solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050505">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252987" Type="2">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Affiliation> went up on January 19 and met with the hereditary leadership of Wet'suwet'en. The Green Party has been trying to appeal to the federal government from the beginning to not let the RCMP arrest people. The huge encampment cost Canada a whole year of a remote location of RCMP detachment encampment on the edge of Wet'suwet'en territory. It is very remote. My colleague from Nanaimo—Ladysmith went up there and found that they had offered an alternative route. This was acknowledged in the injunction case that granted an injunction to Coastal GasLink. The Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs had offered another location that would avoid the Kweese trail, but according to the court, Coastal GasLink unilaterally rejected the alternative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050506">The federal government has to step up. I am glad the federal government is stepping up. It is true that on February 5 in this place, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that “This is an issue that is entirely under provincial jurisdiction.” That is true insofar as the pipeline goes. It does not cross a provincial border, but it is massively untrue. We talk about indigenous rights, the Delgamuukw decision of 1997, the Tsilhqot'in decision of 2014. The big question to ask when first nations win in our courts is this: What is the statute of limitations on us doing anything about it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050507">The Wet'suwet'en have been enormously patient and the Unist'ot'en camp has been sitting there for 10 years.</ParaText>

This is an aspect of solidarity. This is the solidarity of indigenous people across Canada and their allies, people like me who are settler culture Canadians, who recognize that this is a turning point for this country, where we actually mean what we say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050510">I heard a comment from the brilliant senator and former justice Murray Sinclair from the other place, who said, as in Paul Simon in <I>The Boxer</I>, “For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises.” We must set aside our pocket full of mumbles.

              <ParaText id="6050515">Madam Speaker, today we are talking about the Canadian value of how we take care of each other when we are sick. We are talking about improvements to the employment insurance sickness benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050516">On average, people who claimed sickness benefits in fiscal year 2017-18 used 10 weeks of the benefit and then returned to work. However, quite a large cohort, 36% or about 150,000 Canadians, exhausted their full 15 weeks before they could go back to work. Among those 150,000 Canadians, women and older Canadians were more likely to need more than 15 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050517">This is a very serious issue facing Canadians who are sick or injured.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050518">Imagine being a single parent and then overnight no longer being able to pay the bills. Nobody needs that kind of pressure while trying to rest and get better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050519">It is the government’s responsibility to put measures in place to keep the Canadian workforce strong, healthy and productive.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050520">A healthy, strong and productive workforce means a healthy, strong and productive economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050521">That is why our government has committed to increasing the sickness benefit from 15 weeks to 26 weeks. This commitment was praised by the Canadian Cancer Society and aligns well with the requests from The Conference Board of Canada and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to enhance the support of people living with MS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050522">The main goal of the EI program is to support people and at the same time maintain their connection to the labour market. This is doubly important, as we know that employers face shortages in labour in all sectors across the country. Keeping Canadians connected to active work lives is important both for the well-being of Canadians and for the well-being of our economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050523">As the minister responsible for disability inclusion, I attach paramount importance to this matter. Part of my work, under the Accessible Canada Act, is to ensure that barriers faced by persons with disabilities are removed so that they can fully participate in society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050524">To explain the connection with employment insurance sickness benefits, let me use multiple sclerosis as an example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050525">Those with multiple sclerosis have what is called an episodic disability. This means that they go through periods when they are well enough to work, and others when that is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050526">In 2018, we made changes to the employment insurance sickness benefit to allow claimants to use the rules governing work during a benefit period. Workers therefore enjoy greater flexibility in availing themselves of the assistance provided by employment insurance while doing part of their work in the same week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050527">According to the Conference Board of Canada, if those with multiple sclerosis could remain in or re-enter the workforce more easily, it could increase our economic activity by $1.1 billion annually. That is a win-win situation. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050528">Our government has committed to extending sickness benefits to 26 weeks. I want to impress upon my colleagues the importance of getting this right, of acting from the best evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050529">I encourage the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities to study this matter as soon as possible. We do not want Canadians falling through the cracks.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050530">As I mentioned earlier, we are determined to improve the employment insurance plan so that it better serves employees and employers. We are continuing to work hard to improve the program. I will talk about that now and let my parliamentary secretary add some details shortly.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050531">I am very proud and pleased to say that Canada recently scored 100, a perfect score, on the World Bank's women, business and the law index. This was due in part to our recent reform regarding parental leave benefits that reserve five weeks of paid leave for the second parent, typically the father. With this step, we are ensuring that Canada is a place where everyone can be on equal footing in terms of work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050532">As Unifor national president Jerry Dias said, “In addition to making it easier for women to return to work this extra leave will help to even out childcare responsibilities and break down gender-based parenting roles.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050533">Another major improvement was to reduce the time people have to wait before receiving their benefits. In January 2017, we reduced it from two weeks to one week in order to ease the financial burden for those receiving employment insurance benefits. This change puts more than $650 million into the pockets of Canadians each year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050538">An example of this is the creation of the employment insurance family caregiver benefit for adults. This new benefit is making a big difference in the lives of many Canadians who work hard, but must also take off work to care for a loved one. For a maximum of 15 weeks, it allows eligible family caregivers to provide care for an adult family member who is critically ill or injured. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050539">I would also like to highlight that for the first time, immediate and extended family members of children who are critically ill now have access to a benefit that was previously available only to parents. This goes beyond immediate family and even relatives. Individuals who are not relatives but considered to be like family, for example, a neighbour, could be eligible to receive the benefit to provide care to a critically ill child. Caregivers can share the available weeks of benefits at the same time or separately.</ParaText>

He was contributing the whole time and here he is now, at a time when he needs help, and the government is not honouring it.

I am quite disappointed to see that it will remain capped at 26 weeks. As our leader said earlier, in my opinion, only a minority of people would need the full period. For those who have cancer and need a year to get back on their feet and get a little financial support, let us show a little compassion and extend it to 50 weeks, even though the Canadian Cancer Society is asking for 26.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050580">I mention that because in the first Parliament of which I was a member, we spent the better part of our time in a majority government opposing opposition day motions. Such is the norm of majority governments. In the last Parliament, I experienced an opposition day motion on the other side of that scenario; in fact, I was privileged to submit my own opposition day motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050581"> If I may take a moment, it was an eminently reasonable motion, calling on the Liberal government to expedite the Comeau case in the Supreme Court. Members may recall that Mr. Comeau was ticketed by his home province of New Brunswick for purchasing alcohol in nearby Quebec. His efforts to economize by shopping for the best prices is a situation that I am sure more and more Canadians can relate to, and they would question why the state was cracking down on someone who had purchased products lawfully, as Mr. Comeau had done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050582">As many have overlooked, the Liberal government had actually joined in the fight against the Comeau case in the eventual Supreme Court proceedings. It did not truly support internal free trade among all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050583">However, that is not the point of my sharing this memory. The point is that my motion, an eminently reasonable one, to expedite the Comeau case ended up in a vote, as opposition motions do, and that vote was one of the rare times, at least in the previous Parliament, when the NDP, the Greens and, as I recall, the Bloc Québécois all voted in support of my motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050584">The Liberal majority government, to my surprise and of course disappointment, voted against it. Privately, after that vote, I had several Liberal MPs confide in me that they were whipped to vote that way and had no idea why the all-powerful inner circle and PMO had whipped them to vote against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050585">I share this story today because we all know that in this minority Parliament, we collectively have the power to vote in favour of an opposition day motion and see it pass. To date, opposition parties have a pretty solid record of seeing opposition day motions getting passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050586">To go on to this motion, once again I feel the need to share some personal comments. It does not happen often in this place, but there is the odd time when I very much want to support a motion but at the same time have strongly considered voting the motion down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050587">Why the dilemma? It is because I believe we are all here to help build a better Canada. However, at times we may have some disagreement on the best ways to do that. At times we may even agree on an idea or a program but have disagreement on the details of how that idea, project or program should be written into legislation. This is one of those times.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050589">I absolutely agree that employment insurance sickness benefits are an important program. I also agree that extending the term in which these benefits are available is something that should be seriously looked at. The term has not changed since 1971, so as the minister said earlier, I believe this should go to the HUMA committee. I believe this should be looked at, because I have some issues concerning the motion and how the magic number of 50 weeks was literally drawn out of a hat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050590">Why 50 weeks? Why not 52? Why not 43? Why not 54? Why not 26? Some adherents of Douglas Adams, not to be confused with Tommy Douglas, would say the answer is obviously 42.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050591">Can anyone explain the logic and science of 50 weeks? Every week of added eligibility adds costs that both current and future workers and their employers have to carry. The member who spoke before me was the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>, and she actually talked about more benefits that the government is looking to pass. We need to recognize that ultimately those costs would mean employers will pay more, which makes them less competitive, and employees would net less take-home pay in an era of ever-rising costs and taxes, which could create hardship and fiscal pressures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050592">What if very few people accessed this program? What type of serious illness would qualify or not qualify for this extension? These are all unanswered questions, but they are important ones.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050593"> When most of us in our personal lives sign a cheque, we want to know exactly how much it is for and what that cheque will actually buy. In many respects, I feel like this motion asks us all collectively to sign a blank cheque for a worthy and well-intended cause, but with a random number of 50 weeks just because someone liked the sound of 50 weeks, or roughly 11 and a half months. Again, when I asked the leader of the Bloc Québécois, he said that it was to match with what the program currently offers. Depending on one's local situation, how the labour markets are, it could be anywhere between 15 and 45 weeks. The number 50 seems to be in defiance of that. The <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> had said that the Canadian Cancer Society had made a different recommendation, and that is where they are landing on this. We do need to investigate this further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050594">What could be done instead of 11 and a half months or 50 weeks? In the last Parliament, HUMA, the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, studied the issue and recommended an extended time period. Unfortunately, the extended time period was not defined by the committee. Perhaps further study with relevant experts could help guide us all to having more information with more data and more evidence so we can collectively make a more informed decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050595">Again, the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said there is a potpourri of different additions she is planning to the EI system. Those need to be studied. I believe the more collectively we can study those, the better we can get a sense of what the costs are going to be. One impact added on may be incremental costs, but when one starts adding multiple different impacts, those complicated formulae do take more time to assess and do take more costs to deal with. It also must be pointed out that the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated this EI sickness benefit extension of 50 weeks would cost over $1 billion immediately and would continue to rise every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050596">I know there are those who would dismiss an extra $1 billion annually in payroll costs, but in British Columbia today, we now have B.C.-based forestry companies shutting down their lumber mills in order to invest and open new mills in the United States. While there are many reasons why this occurs, one of the reasons is that the cost of doing business in Canada is no longer competitive for their business models. It makes more sense for them to operate outside of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050597">When that happens, we lose thousands of well-paying jobs like we have seen in British Columbia. It also means we have thousands of workers now unemployed, collecting EI and no longer contributing to it. That is why competitiveness should never be overlooked in a motion such as this one that ultimately proposes to create new costs that decrease our competitiveness. For those small businesses that cannot afford to expand into jurisdictions outside of Canada, let us not forget they are competing against other small businesses in jurisdictions outside of Canada that do not have to swallow these costs and pass them along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050598">We also need to bear in mind that such a change to medical employment insurance does not cover the employers themselves. I was recently contacted by an entrepreneur in my riding who complained that the government restricted her use of what is called a health savings account because her business was too small. I am sure there are many people in this place who have seen how agencies like CRA continue to assess and audit and audit and assess small businesses and make all sorts of demands, regardless of the health of the business or the entrepreneur.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050599"> In my home province of British Columbia, small businesses account for 98% of our total business. Oftentimes these are sole proprietors, partnerships and small corporations that often have to stop work when the entrepreneur does. We should be mindful that while there are some able to self-fund or purchase short-term disability, more often than not it is not practical for their enterprise. Entrepreneurs might welcome this change, some who want to see their employees supported when they receive a serious diagnosis, but when time after time these entrepreneurs and their family members are frequently told to give up more time, energy and cash, they might wonder where they factor in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050600">Ultimately, these are some of the serious concerns I have heard with this motion. EI premiums are paid for by workers and their employers. We should always be mindful that this is money that they have paid. When it comes to a time when people are facing potentially their greatest life challenge, the EI fund that they have paid into, working for their entire lives, should be there for them in their time of need. We are not talking about government money. We are talking about money that has been put aside by employers and their employees for them. That is money off the backs of workers and employers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050601"> A serious medical illness is stressful enough. One does not need the added pressure of trying to pay the bills at the end of the month and coming up short. </ParaText>

When I spoke to the CEO of the largest private employer in the area of west Kelowna, I asked him about competitiveness and he told me it was not Belgium or Spain that he was worried about competing with. It was the former eastern Soviet bloc countries where the labour is very adequate, costs and regulations are extremely low and there is a high availability of fibre supply. They have seen investment shift from some of those northern countries in Europe over to the eastern bloc countries.

              <ParaText id="6050610">Mr. Speaker, the simple argument in response is that the Liberals have been proposing a whole bunch of different changes and have not made this change to an existing program. That is part of the problem I think we have as a society, but more importantly, it shows up in the Liberal government time and time again. Rather than try to consolidate and examine the current benefits that exist for supporting Canadians in their time of need, the Liberals tried to move into other areas that were never designed for the EI system. </ParaText>

The government may pretend that money is not getting tight, but Canadians know. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050618"> I would like to start by saying that I am really torn over this motion. We have an expression that explains why.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050619">The phrase is to put one's money where one's mouth is. I think this is something that is very important to do. It means that we put our money in places that matter. In regard to this motion, as a nation and as a government, let us put our money where our people are. It is very important to put our money where our people are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050620">Sadly, like many people in the House, I am no stranger to cancer. My father had cancer. It is a very difficult thing to see any loved one go through. It is never a short process. Recovery takes a long time after an operation. Some people, after having gone through radiation, have to turn the heat up at night because they are cold. This stuff is very devastating and touches the lives of Canadians and everyone in this House personally.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050621">I understand why the Bloc Québécois felt that it was a good idea to introduce this motion.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050622">It really truly touches the lives of Canadians and has the potential to make life much better for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050623">I receive many cases in my office about people who face the things my family went through. I have a note here about a constituent who was dealing with cancer and whose doctor told him he needed to be off work for a specific number of weeks before he would be given a letter that he was in the clear. The gap between his sick benefits running out and his date for going back to work was significant. He said that he did not know how, other than remortgaging his home or borrowing from friends and family, he was going to be able to survive. He would have to either try to return to work before he was cleared to do so or remain at home with no money coming in. His wife was also dealing with health issues and had not been working for some time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050624">This motion has the potential to help people. As the previous speaker mentioned, it would allow for a lot less stress in people's lives as they could focus on their recovery and getting better, which is all that they want to do. It would allow them to focus on returning to work and becoming a productive member of society. Every Canadian wants to contribute to this amazing nation of ours. From a fiscally conservative perspective, I believe this would relieve billions from our health care system over time. Individuals would be given the time needed to fully recover before returning to work rather than being forced back to work before being ready or able to do so, as we have seen in these cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050625">In the short three months I have been shadow minister for families, children and social development, I have learned that the system is broken. It is absolutely broken. This is why I have a difficult time supporting this motion. While it is a small change to go from 15 weeks to 50 weeks, it has life-changing potential, but so much more has to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050626">We are a nation that needs a national anti-poverty strategy. We are a nation that needs a housing strategy of $40 billion over 10 years. We are a nation with seniors who are not able to make ends meet. OAS and CPP need a major re-evaluation. We are a nation where so many families rely on the Canada child benefit. To me, all of this really speaks to the fact that our nation is broken. Our system is broken. Will this motion be enough? Sadly, I am really not sure.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050627">However, I do know that there is a lot of waste. Until this point, 2020, there has been a cost of $1.1 billion for this implementation. There will be $1.3 billion by 2025. Those are not small amounts at all, especially with a 2019 budget projection of $355.6 billion. That is just so much money that I am very torn about this as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050628">As I said, I am torn because I see the benefit of this for Canadians in terms of their quality of life and time for recovery, but I also worry about the entire system and the costs of it as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050629">We have seen no shortage of waste from the government, unfortunately, with $20 million going to the food waste reduction challenge. That is a lot of money for such a challenge. The last time we sat here, we saw the government give $50 million to Mastercard. That is a significant amount of money. We have to ask if this large budget is being spent effectively. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050630">In the last Parliament, we talked about the $12 million that went to Loblaws to retrofit fridges. These are not insignificant amounts at all. It goes back again to what I said about putting our money where our people are, rather than wasting it. As I also mentioned, the system is broken. I wish I could say the waste stops there, but it does not: $950 million was allocated for an innovation supercluster initiative to create 50,000 jobs. We do not know if that is actually happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050631">It is very hard to consider investing so much more money in our government on the backs of taxpayers when we have this incredible amount of waste, this incredible debt and this incredible deficit. These are definitely things that we have to consider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050632">As my colleague and the previous speaker alluded to as well, the government does things halfway. I saw in its 2019 platform that it was considering going to 26 weeks, not quite halfway but somewhere between the 1971 precedent, which I agree is outdated, and the amount of time proposed by the Bloc in this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050633">Again, it is a government that does things halfway, such as letting Trans Mountain go on and on with no approval, then finally purchasing the pipeline for $4.4 billion, but to what end? We are seeing the government waffle and waver again here with Teck Frontier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050634"> There is the government's inability to take a stand or make a decision on something. It just tries to find a sloppy compromise without being principled, really making a difference or changing anything. It is incredibly frustrating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050635">I thank the Bloc for bringing forward this motion today, although I was very disturbed to see that one of their final three proposed motions was to vote down Teck Frontier. It was a complete rejection of that. I feel that we as Conservatives have been very kind toward the Bloc and Quebec initiatives, especially in regard to NAFTA, steel, aluminum and those sorts of things. It was very disappointing to see that motion made it to potentially be one of the final three.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050651">Mr. Speaker, I recognized all of these programs to indicate just how broken our society is. In fact, I thank the speaker because I cannot think of a single better example. In the last four weeks, I had visits from the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253812" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary</Affiliation> for housing. They handed out 296 units to people in Calgary, in a province where they have lost over 100,000 jobs. This is exactly the problem that I am talking about. It is putting band-aids on the destruction of our economy as a result of the legislation of our entire livelihood and natural resources sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050652"> I am saying we cannot do this any more. We cannot put on band-aids and say to people we gave them a house or so many dollars a month. These problems go beyond that. Canadian families want to be independent, to take care of themselves and their children. They do not want to rely on programs like this, and the government is perpetuating that. This is not an example of a resolution. This is an example of the symptoms and the bigger problems.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050653">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues for bringing forward this important motion, allowing us to debate this important priority for the NDP. As many people will know, this was an NDP campaign promise in the most recent election. It put this idea forward in a bill in the past two Parliaments and is delighted to do so in the 43rd Parliament as well. However, this has not been the case with the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050654">When they were not in government, the Liberals voted for increases in special employment insurance sickness benefits, but as soon as they were elected, that support vanished. Instead, we were told that they would “revisit” the issue. The flip-flopping at the expense of sick Canadians is unconscionable and I urge my government colleagues to support this important motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050655">While I am so proud to be a member of the New Democratic Party and am delighted to stand in support of this motion, I would like to take this opportunity to share a deeply personal story, which I hope will illustrate the need for the House to pass this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050656">On November 26, 2016, my doctor told me that I had a very aggressive form of cancer and would require emergency surgery and the removal of a significant portion of my large intestine. I was the mother of a nine-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter and I have never been more afraid than I was at that point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050657">My life very quickly changed. I went from being a very busy mother, driving kids to swim practices, hockey games and music lessons, and being the executive director of a non-profit organization, to a cancer patient who had non-stop medical appointments and tests. It took me months to recover from my surgery and cancer treatment. I could not do anything. I could not get groceries. I could not do the laundry. I could not drive or even get out of bed without assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050658">It was a terrible time in my life, but I still recognize how lucky I was. I had access to incredible medical care. I had an incredibly supportive husband and family, and my husband had a good job with benefits. We were able to continue to pay our bills, buy the expensive pain medication and medical supplies and make ends meet. I did not have the added stress of worrying about supporting myself and my family while undergoing medical treatment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050659">In a country with as much wealth and prosperity as Canada, I hope that no Canadian would have to bear the additional burden of being unable to pay their bills, buy the nourishing food they need to heal or access the medication they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050660">The Parliamentary Budget Officer published a report entitled “Cost Estimate of an Increase in the Duration of Employment Insurance (EI) Sickness Benefits” and found that to increase the number of weeks of sickness benefits to 50 would require the employee premium rate to rise by a total of six cents from the baseline rate of $1.62 per $100 of insurable earnings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050661">The PBO found that 77% of recipients who used this benefit survived following illness, but were not ready to return to work once they had exhausted their 15 weeks. We are letting more than three out of four Canadians with major illnesses like this simply run out of options over an increase of six cents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050662">Almost one in two people in Canada will develop cancer at some point in their lives, an illness with an average treatment length of 52 weeks. Fifteen weeks of benefits are simply not enough to allow people to heal before returning to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050663">With breast cancer, 25 to 36 weeks is the average time for treatment and recovery. For colon cancer, it is 37 weeks. With the benefit currently at 15 weeks, we know that it is not meeting the needs of patients experiencing these cancers. When will the government finally commit to making this change to increase these special benefits to 50 weeks? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050664">We know that 50 weeks is what we give mothers after they give birth. Why would people who have life-threatening diseases not be given the same benefits? The Liberal government has just given $50 million to Mastercard and over $10 million to Loblaws, yet it cannot uphold its own promise to increase El benefits to the sick and injured. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050666">More than 600,000 people have signed the petition, calling on the government to increase EI sickness benefits from 15 to 50 weeks for workers who are sick. The NDP wants to fix the employment insurance system that many Canadians need to rely on when they are dealing with an illness so it no longer falls short by not providing the flexibility to support those who want to work when they can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050667">I will be splitting my time, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050668"> In addition to an increase in special benefits, the New Democrats would like to see expanded access to retraining and the creation of a pilot project that would allow workers with episodic disabilities to access EI sickness benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050669">We want to prevent the situation that occurred in 2010, when the federal government transferred $57 billion from the employment insurance account into the government's general revenue.</ParaText>

It is intended to assist Canadians who are facing financially challenging events like unemployment, injury and new parenthood. It is also intended to support Canadians who are afflicted with a serious illness like cancer and require lengthy periods of recuperation. They require the support the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050671">Consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments have neglected our EI system, allowing it to become decimated and broken, unable to meet the needs of Canadians. It has not been revised since before I was born in 1971. It is time for an upgrade.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050693">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak today to the importance of extending the EI benefit to 50 weeks for people who are suffering illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050694">Those who have followed the House for some time will know that in the last Parliament, the NDP had a private member's bill to accomplish exactly this. In the Parliament before that, the NDP had a private member's bill to accomplish exactly this. We are happy to continue pushing and arguing for this change, because we know it matters to a lot of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050695"> I think everyone in the House and across the country who might be listening will have had the experience, either themselves or that of a loved one, a good friend or a work colleague, where they cannot perform their regular work duties due to an illness. We know what a difficult time that is in their lives, and that of their families and friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050696">However, that difficulty is compounded, seriously, when they cannot pay their bills at the end of the month because there is no wage replacement in place. That is exactly why people might want to insure their wages, which is what Canadian workers do in conjunction with employers under the employment insurance program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050697">It is incumbent on us to allow that vehicle for Canadians to insure themselves. This is not a charity case. This is not a government handout. This is a program that employer and employees pay into to insure the wages of employees when they need it. Certainly, when people get cancer or some other form of serious illness that inhibits them from being able to go to work and do their jobs, that is exactly the kind of case in which they need that wage replacement. It is one of the reasons we have, and ought to have, employment insurance in the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050698">Earlier in the debate today, a number of members asked “Why 50 weeks? What is special about 50 weeks?” The <Affiliation DbId="252623" Type="2">Bloc leader</Affiliation> mentioned one reason why 50 weeks was important. If employees have been working for the amount of time required to qualify for employment insurance and they get laid off, those employees would get up to 50 weeks of coverage. It makes sense that if through no fault of their own, not because they were laid off but because they have become seriously ill, they would qualify for the same treatment as those who were laid off. That is certainly one very good reason why 50 weeks matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050699">Another reason why 50 weeks matters is that one in two Canadians, in his or her lifetime, will have some kind of serious illness, with an average treatment length in the neighbourhood of 50 or 52 weeks. At some time, in all likelihood, half the people in this room will face a serious health challenge that will take almost a year to treat. It makes sense that if we are insuring ourselves against lost wages in the event of sickness, we do it in a way that is commensurate with the likely absence from work resulting from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050700">A third reason why it makes sense to extend sickness benefits under EI to 50 weeks is because a lot of long-term disability plans kick in at the one-year mark. Right now, to get from the end of the 15-week coverage to when long-term disability would kick in takes somewhere in the neighbourhood of 40 weeks. If we had a 50-week sickness benefit, that would make that transition period a matter of only a couple of weeks, effectively giving every Canadian, no matter what workplace they work in, whether they are unionized or non-unionized, whether their collective agreement has a short-term disability plan or not, a short-term disability plan to help bridge them to when a longer-term disability plan might kick in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050701">Those are three very good reasons to set the goal at 50 weeks. The only reason not to would be if there was a significant financial cost that Canadians could not bear. However, the Parliamentary Budget Officer has done a study on this very issue and has said that the difference in premiums would be approximately 6¢ on every $100 of insurable wages. Folks can correct me later if I am wrong. This sounds quite affordable to me. I think a lot of Canadians would not mind paying for this. That is purpose of having this debate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6050702">We have had this debate many times in the House and we have heard a lot of compelling testimony as to why we ought to do this. It is frustrating for us on this side of the House that we have not been able to get there yet, because the reasons for getting there are quite compelling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050703">If we think about what that means for the plan, we are not talking about raising taxes. We are talking about somewhere in the neighbourhood of $1 billion a year to provide this important insurance to Canadians who are sick and not able to perform their duties at work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050704">I recall when the Liberal government in the mid-nineties made significant changes to the EI program. That government made it harder to access EI and it raised the premiums. Over 15 or 20 years, a relatively short period of time for the amount of money we are talking about, that government accumulated a $57-billion surplus in the EI account. The Conservative government then transferred it under the auspices of the PMO to do we know not what. We do not know where it went. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050705">The idea that the employment insurance fund, which is funded apart from tax revenues through premiums paid by employees and employers, cannot afford to do an extra $1 billion a year, when that represents only 6¢ on $100 of insurable earnings, and when the government had such a massive surplus that was squirrelled away, is just a farce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050706">The fact is that $57-billion surplus could have paid for the extension of this benefit, which will do a lot for many Canadians right across the country, for over 50 years. We had the money. Where did it go? That is the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050707">Even without getting that money back, the go-forward cost of making this change is a reasonable one for a very concrete benefit to Canadians who are living out some of the worst times of their lives. The sickness and the health challenges are enough. They ought not to be compounded by further financial difficulty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050708">Let us not kid ourselves either. Getting a 55% wage replacement is not exactly a financial paradise. It is not a panacea. Figuring out how to get by on that level of wage replacement is challenging enough for people who are facing serious illness. The least we could do is extend a hand to Canadians and ensure that the employment insurance program they already self-finance, along with their employers, covers them in times of great need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050709">That is why we are very proud to support the motion today. It is why we have been proud to bring this proposal forward many times in many other Parliaments. It is why, notwithstanding whatever might happen on this particular motion, the NDP is going to be there every step of the way fighting for this change until we get it done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050711">I would like to hear his thoughts on the use of the EI fund versus general revenue for these kinds of things. Generally speaking, in terms of the efficiency of taxation, having employment deductions, that is, taxing work, is a less desirable and less efficient form of taxation. To be formally correct, we would not say it is taxation exactly, but deductions at that point have more of a negative impact on the economy than revenue raised in other ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050712">Does the member think there is an argument for providing this kind of support for people in this situation through other mechanisms not involving the EI fund? I am curious to hear his thoughts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050714">When I hear the idea of governments providing this benefit directly, having seen what governments have done, even when they should have been arm's length, I prefer the idea that we do this in a way that is arm's length and managed in a transparent way. Canadians will then know they are paying a fair premium dollar for the insurance they are receiving, and employers will know they are paying a fair premium dollar for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050715">We need to get government out of this one. We need to set up the fund in a way that is open, transparent and meets the needs of Canadians. We then need to leave well enough alone instead of having governments needlessly running up surpluses within EI while restricting access and then spending the money on something else.</ParaText>

Does the member agree that perhaps there is no one answer to fit everybody? I had a family member who had cancer and lost her battle with it. She could not work for two and a half years. I know we have done things with maternity leave like spread out the unemployment to a year and a half versus a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050718">Would it not be the best path for something like this to go to committee? Members could examine it and come back with some good, firm recommendations. It is not just about looking after people for one year because, as I said, it was two and a half years that somebody could not work. She did qualify for other benefits, but still, there was no EI or anything like that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050720">Mr. Speaker, there is no question that each person is going to live out a major health issue differently. Some cases will be resolved more quickly and others will take longer. We know that approximately a third of the people who qualify for the benefit as it stands report that by the end of the 15 weeks they are still in need and in treatment, and that it is not enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050721">We know the program is already not working for a significant cross-section of people, and we know the 50-week mark would help us transition to long-term disability plans and cover that gap. It seems to me that 50 weeks is the way to secure the maximum amount of flexibility and make things easiest for Canadians. That is why I support the 50-week amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050722">I would also say we are in a funny position. If we look at the caregiver benefit under the compassionate care EI stream, Canadians can get up to 26 weeks off of work insured under EI in order to help a family member with a serious health issue, but that family member can only qualify for a 15-week benefit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050723">There is serious tension, and I am being generous by calling it only a tension, in the current EI policy. There are always questions about where we draw the line, but it is our job here to draw that line and I think it makes sense to draw it at 50 weeks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050725">We know that employment insurance needs to be overhauled. This government did not get the job done in the last Parliament. The Bloc Québécois has always advocated for improvements to the employment insurance program and all its benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050726">Improvements to the special EI benefit for serious illnesses are long overdue. We can really see the problem when we know someone dealing with a serious illness like cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050727">On December 9, the leader of the Bloc Québécois and I spoke publicly in support of the demands of two cancer survivors. You will remember that Émilie Sansfaçon and Marie-Hélène Dubé came to the House as they had been fighting for years to have the federal government make necessary changes to the special sickness benefits and increase them from 15 to 50 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050728">To that end, our motion is very simple and very clear. I am going to repeat it.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House call on the government to increase the special Employment Insurance sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 50 weeks in the upcoming budget in order to support people with serious illnesses, such as cancer.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6050730">In its election platform, the Liberal Party promised to increase EI sick benefits from 15 to 26 weeks. That is fine, but it is not enough. It is not nearly enough.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6050731">Need I remind hon. members, as we did earlier, how this program got started more than 40 years ago? In fact, the Parliamentary Budget Officer talked about it. The original EI sickness benefit period of 15 weeks was based on surveys by the Department of Employment and Social Development showing that only 23% of claimants returned to work immediately after the 15-week benefit period ended. Among the remaining claimants, 82% took 16 weeks or more before returning to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050732">Even when this benefit was created it was clear that just 15 weeks was woefully inadequate. The content of the program was therefore based on the proportion of claimants who returned to work more quickly rather than on the majority of the program's claimants. We could correct this mistake, which I would describe as historic, by supporting the motion before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050733">Let us imagine for a moment that we were diagnosed with a serious illness that prevented us from working and forced us to rely on these special sickness benefits. I am sure that we all have family or friends who are going through this. As if getting such news were not bad enough, these people also have to take the necessary steps and meet several criteria before they can access the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050734">I will not get into details, but in order to qualify, a worker must have worked 600 hours to receive 55% of their earnings for 15 weeks. The House can raise that number from 15 to 50 to genuinely reflect the reality of those in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050735">According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, extending EI sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 50 would cost an additional $1.1 billion a year. To absorb the cost, EI premiums would have to be raised by six cents per $100 of insurable earnings. That is feasible. We must not forget that this $1.1-billion cost is based on a benefit period of 50 weeks. However, that is not the reality. The 50 weeks of benefits would be in line with what workers receive when they lose their job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050736">Not everyone will take full advantage of 50 weeks of EI sickness benefits. The goal of every worker is to go back to work healthy, and the purpose of this program is to protect people who are really in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050737">In terms of fairness, compassionate care benefits are a special case. We do not object to offering 26 weeks of benefits to people caring for loved ones at risk of dying within six months. What we find peculiar is that people caring for a loved one get more weeks of benefits than people who are sick themselves. That is not right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050738">When we say that the Liberals promised to offer 26 weeks of benefits because the Canadian Cancer Society and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada called for it, we are talking statistics. When we talk to people who are affected, like Ms. Sansfaçon and others who have received multiple cancer diagnoses or been diagnosed with MS, people who have been unable to work for more than 50 weeks, people who have been fighting for years, and unemployed workers' associations from all of our regions and those of other provinces, it becomes very clear that extending benefits to 50 weeks is a matter of fairness and dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050739">It is possible that not everyone will use 50 weeks of benefits. However, one thing that is certain is that 26 weeks of benefits are not enough. We will be creating a space where we neglect people who need benefits. We do not want to create a black hole in EI sickness benefits as we have done for seasonal workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050740">We absolutely must guarantee 50 weeks of benefits to avoid future situations like the ones experienced by two individuals who came to testify. When someone is diagnosed with cancer and knows they will need treatment, their first thought should not be how they will make ends meet. Financial considerations should not be a greater concern than care and treatment. The testimony was very compelling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050741">We are talking about returning to work. Everyone hopes to go back to work. Our system is based on that. People who lose their job want to find another one. People who need sickness benefits for serious illnesses also hope to recover and go back to work. According to the Supreme Court of Canada, the employment insurance power “must be interpreted generously. Its objectives are not only to remedy the poverty caused by unemployment, but also to maintain the ties between unemployed persons and the labour market.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050742">The Conseil national des chômeurs et chômeuses provided some good statistics in the brief it submitted to the Standing Committee on Finance, including this fact: “Of all the G7 countries, excluding the United States but including Russia, Canada has the worst health benefits coverage of any country”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050743">Here, we make choices. We take care of our people. Employment insurance provides only 15 weeks of special benefits to a person with a serious illness, while workers who lose their job are entitled to benefits for up to 50 weeks. We have to restore fairness and give sick people the chance to recover with dignity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050744">Several similar bills have been introduced in the House. In 2012, the Liberals, who were on the opposition benches at the time, introduced one such bill, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who was just an MP back then, voted in favour of it, so it is possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050745">The Liberal government claims to be working in a spirit of co-operation. It says it supports the middle class and workers. That means this bill could be passed quickly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050758">The EI fund is an independent fund paid for by employee and employer contributions. It is a guarantee, an insurance policy for people who lose their job or fall gravely ill. Special benefits have been added. </ParaText>

For the benefit of those who are watching us on TV and who may be wondering why I am wearing a green ribbon, I want to point out that this week Quebec is celebrating Hooked on School Days. The members of the Bloc Québécois who rise today are proud to support Hooked on School Days, which are so important to our nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050762">As I have said many times, I am a social worker by training. Before I became a member of Parliament I worked in a CLSC. I worked with the most vulnerable members of our community, including the sick and those who needed support. I am very proud to share a little about my job today, because it shows why I support this important motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050763">Social workers in Quebec's health care network are fortunate to have good, unionized, secure jobs with group insurance that guarantees they will get paid in case of illness. The union negotiates this insurance. It helps workers get treatment and return to work quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050764">Today, I can say that, over the course of my career, I have met many people who do not have the privilege of having insurance or of having a job that gives them everything they need to get through difficult times in their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050765">The people we are talking about today and who will be affected by this motion, should the government support it, are the type of people who are not that fortunate, who do not have the privilege of having a job that guarantees them group insurance coverage at times of personal hardship. They are workers who like their jobs and have the misfortune of getting sick. When the doctor tells them about chemotherapy and radiation, the first thing they think about is how they are going to pay their rent if the treatment takes a long time or if the cancer comes back. I am not talking about a mortgage here, because people who own their own homes often have mortgage insurance that covers payments in the event of misfortune. I am talking about people in precarious jobs, who live in apartments, who do not own their own homes, and who get sick. I am talking about people who have to fight to beat a serious illness and quickly get back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050766">In my professional life, I met with people in this situation whose jobs were precarious, who were good workers, men and women who wanted to work and who paid EI premiums, fulfilled all their responsibilities as workers, but who became ill. This motion, this amendment of the Employment Insurance Act that the Bloc Québécois has been championing for many years, seeks to meet the needs of these people and of these workers in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050767">The government is telling us that it is too much to ask for 50 weeks, that benefits are increasing from 15 to 26 weeks. It is saying that the opposition always wants the maximum amount. That is a rather odd way of looking at things. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252775" Type="2">Thérèse-De Blainville</Affiliation> stated, when someone has this serious illness and requires treatments that prevent them from working, when they become that statistic, the person who goes over the 15 or 26 weeks, it is not about exaggerating, it is about being compassionate, understanding and inclusive. This is a social safety net that Quebec and all provinces want to provide to their workers who become ill. <Sup /><Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050768">Let's now take a look at the 26 weeks that are provided to family caregivers. People in their mid-fifties like myself are often parents, grandparents and also family caregivers. As society is changing and people are living longer, people of my generation must support their children, grandchildren and parents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6050769">Essentially, the Employment Insurance Act was amended to make things right and address this new social reality by increasing special benefits for caregivers to 26 weeks. It is a very good idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050770">I have worked in a CLSC, and I can honestly say that this measure was really helpful, particularly for providing at-home support to seniors in rural areas. It enabled seniors and very sick people to leave this world with dignity, while surrounded by their loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050771">Now, it is not right for someone to lose their income because they get sick and their treatments require them to miss work for more than 15 weeks. Clearly, the last thing someone in that situation wants to think about is how they will meet their financial obligations if they require further treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050772">When somebody has cancer and lives in a rural area, they must not only shoulder the burden of the disease, but also pay to travel in order to receive treatment, which is often only available in large urban areas. For example, if someone from Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, which is in my riding, needs to get to Montreal for chemotherapy or radiation therapy, it takes an hour to an hour and a half to drive there and costs an average of $45 to $50. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050773">Basically, people get only 15 weeks of employment insurance, even though they often have low-paying jobs that barely allow them to meet their financial obligations. These people have to pay out of pocket to travel for treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050774">The Liberals claim that the Bloc Québécois is being a bit greedy because they have already promised to extend the benefit period from 15 weeks to 26. They say that this is already a lot and that we should not cry wolf. They are suggesting that we keep thinking and that an amendment to the act, such as increasing the benefits to 50 weeks, could be introduced a little later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050775">I have seen a situation first-hand. A member of my family was diagnosed with cancer and fought it. His recovery and treatments lasted over 15 weeks.

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050798">We know that far too many Canadians are coping with serious illnesses, and are worried about being able to get the treatments they need and ending up relying on their families. A serious health problem can disrupt all aspects of their lives, whether it is a chronic or life-threatening illness, such as cancer, mental health illness, stroke, heart attack, etc.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050799">We know that workers and their families face difficult, stressful situations because of this, particularly if they are also dealing with financial burdens. That is why we made changes to the employment insurance plan to make it more responsive to Canadians' actual circumstances.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050800">First, I would like to highlight the employment insurance sickness benefit, which is an important measure supporting Canadians who are unable to work because of illness, injury or quarantine. It allows workers time to restore their health so that they can return to work.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050801">Today, under the Employment Insurance Act, eligible claimants can receive sickness benefits for a maximum period of 15 weeks. Recipients have the flexibility to use their 15 weeks of sickness benefits during the 52-week benefit period. For example, in 2017-18, a total of approximately $1.7 billion in sickness benefits was paid to over 412,000 claimants.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050802">Of that number, 64% of recipients did not use the full 15 weeks of benefits to which they were entitled. That being said, some recipients use up 15 weeks before they are able to return to work, and we are sensitive to the experiences of these Canadians and their families. That is why our government is committed to extending the EI sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 26 weeks in order to help workers pay the bills while they rest and recover.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050803">The proposed extension would support Canadians who are diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer and who need to take time off from their jobs to receive treatment. Sickness benefits are a short-term income replacement measure for temporary absences from work. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050804">It is important to note that in cases of chronic and long-term illness, workers also have other financial support measures at their disposal; for example, Canada pension plan disability benefits, private insurance plan benefits and support from provinces and territories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050805">Since 2016, our government has improved the flexibility of the employment insurance special benefits, which include maternity leave, parental benefits, sickness benefits, compassionate care benefits and family care benefits. Today, millions of Canadians provide informal care and support for critically ill family members. Canadians told us what they wanted, and we found ways of being more flexible and more inclusive for all families.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050806">We announced special measures in budget 2017 to make it easier for caregivers to access EI benefits and give families more flexibility. These measures are making a real difference in the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050807">One example is the creation of the new employment insurance family care benefit for adults.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050808"> This new benefit has made a huge difference in the lives of many hard-working Canadians who must take time off work to care for a loved one. This benefit of up to 15 weeks allows caregivers to provide care for a critically ill or injured adult family member. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050809">I would also like to point out that, for the first time, immediate and extended family members of children who are critically ill have access to a maximum of 35 weeks of benefits, which was previously accessible only to parents.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050810">This goes beyond the immediate family and relatives to individuals who are not relatives but are considered to be like family. For example, neighbours could be eligible to receive the benefits to provide care for a critically ill child. Caregivers can share the available weeks of benefits at the same time or at a separate time. It is estimated that approximately 22,000 families have accessed the new EI caregiving benefit since its creation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050811">Another very important aspect applies to caregivers of both children and adults. More specialists, family physicians and even nurse practitioners will now be authorized to sign medical certificates confirming that a child or adult is critically ill or injured. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050812">This also applies to caregivers who access compassionate care benefits while providing care, including end-of-life care, for a child or adult family member. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050813">This change makes the administrative process easier while allowing Canadians to focus on what really matters, being at the side of their loved ones. Every Canadian situation is unique, with different family and work needs, but every Canadian family deserves our support. That is why the EI benefit is now more flexible and more inclusive for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6050814">In conclusion, what matters most to us is family. When a family member needs help, people must be able to provide care, and we must support these caregivers.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6050831">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here today and to rise in the House to talk about the employment insurance program and, more specifically, about maternity benefits, extended parental benefits and parental sharing benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050832">Becoming a parent can be a stressful time for many Canadians. The weeks leading up to the birth can be fraught with nerves and worry at the best of times. In other complicated cases, mothers-to-be may be on bed rest or even hospitalized. Whatever the case, we want to give Canadians the flexibility to choose the option that best meets their needs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050833">Our employment insurance program is robust and covers a wide range of life situations during which Canadians may need financial support, and maternity benefits is certainly one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050834">We understand how hard it can be for hard-working families to balance their career and their family responsibilities. This is why we have done a lot for parents so far. In December 2017, we launched the extended parental benefit, helping parents across the country to find the right work-family balance. Parents of newborn or newly adopted children are now able to choose between two options. The first option is to receive 35 weeks of parental benefits paid at the standard rate of 55% over 12 months. The second option is to receive 61 weeks of parental benefits for an extended period of time, corresponding to 33% of their average weekly income. They may in fact be paid over a period of 18 months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050835">In March 2019, we launched the parental sharing benefit. This benefit helps support parents, including adoptive and same-sex parents, in sharing a more equal distribution of the joy and the responsibility of raising their children. It does so by offering two options: providing an additional five weeks of employment insurance parental benefits when parents agree to share standard parental benefits; or providing an additional eight weeks for those who choose to extend parental benefit options. The increased flexibility will support parents in their ability to spend quality time in raising their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050836">In addition, eligible mothers are now able to receive maternity benefits earlier, up to 12 weeks before their due date. This is more flexible than the benefits provided under the previous government, which limited benefits to eight weeks before the expected delivery date. I am proud that our government can help Canadians when they need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050837"> Since 2015, we have embarked on a journey to modernize the program so that it reflects today's realities. One of those realities is gender equality. As a side note, I would like to mention that since 2018, the fourth week of September is now Gender Equality Week in Canada. This has been an opportunity for people to celebrate the progress we have made in advancing gender equality in Canada while reflecting on the work that remains to be done to make sure that everyone, regardless of gender, could reach their full potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050838">Gender equality week is now enshrined into law, which is a very good thing. It is a good thing because it reminds us to celebrate our progress as a society, but it is also a week to reflect on the challenges and work that still lie ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050839">I mention this today because even if Canadian women are among the most educated women in the world, they are still the least likely to participate in the labour market and most likely to work part time. On average, women in Canada earn 87 cents for every dollar earned by men on an annual basis. Canadian women are under-represented in positions of leadership, and businesses in Canada are overwhelmingly owned by men.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050840"> It has been estimated that adding more women to the workforce could boost the level of Canada's GDP by as much as 4%. Providing Canadians with the opportunity to realize their full potential is not just the right thing to do: It is the smart thing to do for our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050841">Now, what does gender equality have to do with employment insurance maternity and parental benefits? The answer is, everything. In 2017-18, women represented 84% of all parental benefits claims. This indicates that child care duties continue to fall heavily on mothers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050842">Our government is committed to making evidence-based decisions that take into consideration the impacts of policies on all Canadians, and it fully defends the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6050843">If we are serious about gender equality, we have to integrate it into everything we do. That is why as government, we applied gender-based analysis plus to the decisions that Canadians have elected us to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050844">Equality between Canadian women and men will lead to greater prosperity, not just for women and their families, but for all Canadians. Gender equality is a principle that has guided this government in all our budgets. It has allowed us to take important steps to a more prosperous Canada. It is what drives the employment insurance parental sharing benefit. It is intended to support young families and encourage gender equality in the workplace and at home. This benefit helps to support a more equal distribution of home and work responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050845">As I mentioned earlier, it provides an additional five weeks of EI parental benefits when parents, including adoptive and same-sex parents, agree to share parental leave, or an additional eight weeks for those who choose the extended parental benefit option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050846">Since it was launched, more than 32,000 parents established a claim for extended parental benefits, higher than the anticipated 20,000 claims per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050847">As an interesting fact, in Quebec, 81% of spouses or partners of recent mothers claimed or intended to claim parental benefits in 2017, compared with only 12% in the rest of Canada. In large part, this is due to the Quebec parental insurance plan, the QPIP. This “use it or lose it” approach is designed to create an incentive for all parents to take some leave when welcoming a new child, and to share equally in the responsibility of raising their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050848">Equitable parental leave may lead to equitable hiring practices, reducing conscious and unconscious discrimination against women by employers and reducing stigma against men for taking parental leave. This benefit has been enforced since March 2019. As many as 97,000 Canadian parents are expected to claim the parental sharing benefit annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050849">In closing, I would like to say that for the employment insurance program to continue successfully and play a major role, the government has to continuously make the program more adaptable, more flexible, more inclusive and more accessible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050850">We are committed to doing so, and continue to listen to all Canadians. Their preoccupations are ours. We took action to further the well-being of Canadians and we will continue to do so. By promoting equality, our government will help to create long-term prosperity for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6050854">Mr. Speaker, since 2015, our government has reduced the EI waiting period from two weeks to one week. Since 2015, we introduced new legislation for caregiver leave. Since 2015, we made the working-while-on-claim provisions permanent, and expanded them to include people receiving maternity and sickness benefits. Since 2015, we created new EI provisions for workers in seasonal industries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050855">Finally, we gave parents the choice of taking either 12 months or 18 months for parental leave and introduced a new parental sharing benefit to make it easier for parents to share in the raising of their children, resulting in more equality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6050856">Moving forward, we will further our commitments on EI to expand and build on our promise to Canadian workers and our commitment to equality for all Canadians, continuing to do what we have been doing since 2015.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051136">Mr. Speaker, I was saying that the Bloc Québécois is again calling on the government to take action on employment insurance. This is not the first time we have made this call.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051137">We have always been committed to a thorough reform of the program, whether by establishing an independent fund, improving access to current benefits, ending the classification of the unemployed based on their claims, or, of course, improving benefits, all benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051138">For almost 30 years now, we have been demanding that the EI program be designed for our world—not for the needs of the government, but for the needs of our people, those who have given us the privilege of representing them in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051139">Right now, we have a program that is a direct attack on those who are already in precarious situations, that hurts seasonal workers in our regions and that leaves out those who are ill, seriously ill. The reason is very simple, and that is a lack of political will. The EI program cannot adequately and properly support those truly in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051140">This is precisely why the Bloc Québécois moved the motion we are debating today, which calls on the government to increase the special employment insurance sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 50 weeks in the upcoming budget in order to support people with serious illnesses, such as cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051141">The main motivation for this demand, if one is necessary, is that the period of special employment insurance sickness benefits was based on the use of barely one-quarter of recipients. When the special benefit program was created, the government knew that the number of weeks was insufficient for over three-quarters of recipients. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the Department of Employment and Social Development chose the number of weeks based on survey data that indicated that just 23% of recipients returned to work after the 15 weeks of benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051142">In other words, the government at the time and successive governments since then have known that the EI benefits provided do not adequately meet demand. It is completely unfair that every government elected since has knowingly accepted this situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051143">The EI sickness benefit is inequitable because of the number of hours required to qualify. No matter where they live, be it Vancouver or Blanc-Sablon, claimants need to accumulate 600 insured hours of work to be eligible for benefits. It is also more difficult to qualify for sickness benefits than for regular benefits if the regional unemployment rate is greater than 8.1%, which, according to various economic indicators, is the case for one in four economic regions, despite strong overall job numbers. I shudder to think what things would be like if the economy were doing poorly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051144">In my riding, people in Minganie and the Lower North Shore have to work 180 more hours to qualify for sickness benefits than for regular benefits. The same goes for people in the Gaspé and the Îles-de-la-Madeleine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051145">It seems that no government has wanted to admit that the purpose of employment insurance is not to have a petty cash fund alongside the budget, so that it can dip into it to cover up its deficits or make money off the sick. The purpose of employment insurance is to make life easier for people who are forced out of the labour market for reasons beyond their control. It is insurance, a social safety net to which workers contribute in return for the guarantee and assurance that they will be compensated following an unfortunate event, such as the loss of a job or a serious illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051146">The worst part of it all is that no one chooses to get sick. There is no such thing as someone getting up in the morning and saying to themselves, “I think I am ready for a little serious illness. I am ready for a tragedy. I am ready for some misery.” Getting sick is a tragedy. It turns people's lives upside down. It is a daily struggle. It is stressful and demanding for people. We should be there to support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051147">It is not right for a person to worry and fret about their financial health before their personal health. Situations like that of Marie-Hélène Dubé should not exist. Because she did not work 600 hours, she had to mortgage her house several times while she was fighting cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051148">In such a wealthy society, no one should ever be unable to pay their rent and end up on the street when they are in remission. It is not right for people to be left with nothing when they are going through one of the most difficult ordeals of their lives. It is not right, because we have the power to change things and to enable our people to have some measure of dignity during those trying times.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051149">Also, the government might want to remember the last time it was in opposition when it responds to our motion. In 2012, the Liberal Party overwhelmingly supported a bill that would have extended EI benefits from 15 to 50 weeks and eliminated the wait times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051150">Today, we are reaching out to the Liberals. We are inviting them to follow our lead and to do what should have been done a long time ago, namely make life easier for people who are forced to take time off work because of illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051151">During the vote on the motion, I would like each member of this House to remember that every second person living in Canada will get cancer during their lifetime. If we set aside every other serious or chronic disease that could affect our lives and think only of cancer, half of us will have to rely on EI benefits. We could have to cope with the disease and all the added expenses that go with it with only 15 weeks of benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051152">I think that it is time we did what we should have done a long time ago, namely help people who cannot work and give them time to heal. Providing 50 weeks of benefits is the only way of giving the sick time to heal with dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051153">In closing, I would like to point out that I am thinking about all the people in my riding, about all Canadians, and about one person in particular, who has long fought for the unemployed and who is now fighting an illness. I would like this person to have peace of mind, and I know that the only thing that will do that is to abolish all inequities for all EI claimants, in particular those who are sick.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051154">Mr. Speaker, as many members of the Liberal caucus will say, it is important to recognize that as a government, we all believe very passionately in EI benefits for sickness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051155">We have seen many EI reforms take place over the last number of years. We have listened to the stakeholders, in particular to the Canadian Cancer Society, which has recommended 26 weeks. We have now seen the Liberal government, this government led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, say that we are moving toward a half-year of benefits. That is significant progress. For many years I sat in opposition, and back then the Conservatives completely ignored the issue. We now have a government that is taking tangible action in moving towards a half-year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051156">Would the member from the Bloc not agree that at the very least, we could recognize that? Maybe what we could do or should be doing, because we are not saying “absolutely not” into the future, is advancing the idea of expanding, not only in this area but other possible areas, by recommending that this issue go to a standing committee as opposed to just adding additional weeks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051159">When a person is really passionate, there are no limits, especially when the means are there. I therefore expect to see benefits extended to 50 weeks.</ParaText>

They have been there from the start, and they have faith in me. I must honour them, since what happens here during the 43rd Parliament will determine what happens in Canada in the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051175">I would also like to recognize someone who gave me the courage to do this, and that is former MP Johanne Deschamps. She was a member of the House for four Parliaments, from 2004 to 2011. She made a significant contribution to the well-being of constituents, particularly when it came to employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051176">I would like to explain why I decided to go into politics. In my short life, I have worked in various sectors where employment insurance was very important. I am talking mainly about the forestry industry, which experienced a crisis, and the health sector, which underwent a significant reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051177">I also worked in the arts, in the community sector and in social development. That brings me to the positive impact that an increase in EI sickness benefits would have, and we sincerely hope that will happen. I am sure that members of the House will agree to quickly increase the number of weeks of benefits from 15 to 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051178">As I was saying earlier, I hope that we will be able to improve the employment insurance program during this Parliament. I am sure that we can do so. That is what we have been talking about since this morning. Right now, the system is unfair because it provides only 15 weeks of sickness benefits. People have no control over their health, just like they have no control over a plant closure. This warrants analysis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051179">I have to admit that the employment insurance system has been improved in recent decades. I will admit that, but there is still work that needs to be done to make the system fair. This system is not accessible to most people who contributed to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051180">Let's look back in time, since the best way to know where we are going is to know where we have come from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051181">I want to remind everyone that until 1990, in Canada, the government paid into the EI fund. In 1990, the Conservative government upset the balance by putting an end to federal contributions to the EI fund, meaning it had to be funded entirely by employers and workers. This created a very large deficit. What happened? The government tried to make up for the deficit by slashing the coverage provided by the system, reducing the amounts paid to claimants and tightening the eligibility rules for workers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051182">This had a major impact. It cut the number of people covered by the system in half between 1989 and 1997. It also created a huge surplus, and I have proof. Figures show that labour income accounted for 2.3% of Canada's GDP in 1990 and 0.6% in 2015. The people of Laurentides—Labelle were directly affected by those rules, which put them in an extremely vulnerable situation. I must admit that I even experienced it myself, and I could go on and on about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051183">Those cuts helped amass a slush fund of nearly $50 billion. Who suffered? Our workers and employers suffered. For the last 30 or 40 years, they have been the only contributors to the fund, and every year, the surpluses in the fund are swallowed up by a federal machine whose appetite knows no bounds. I would like to know why taxpayers' money is being used for things that are not in their best interest. It saddens me today to know that many of our friends, colleagues and relatives have been deprived of this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051184">Now I wonder. I think the employment insurance program in its current form is no longer about helping workers. Should those who benefit from this program not be the ones who contribute to it? Some of these people spend their whole life building up this fund without ever being able to access it when they really need it, especially when they involuntarily contract a serious illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051185">We all know that no one chooses to get sick. I would like to share with the House an experience I had a few years ago when I was a political staffer for the hon. member for Laurentides—Labelle, Johanne Deschamps. I was having a hard time helping a constituent when he told me he had just one week of benefits left and was not even halfway through his chemotherapy treatments. I checked the law. Indeed, this person had no other options, since he was not eligible for EI benefits because he had several assets. That bothered me because we had no way of giving him something he was perfectly entitled to receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051186">I would like to share another thought with the House about the term “insurance”. In my opinion, insurance exists to cover real needs, such as theft, fire or disability insurance. When workers have needs due to illness, the program does not do enough to assist them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051187">Do hon. members agree that the assistance should be equivalent to what a worker gets when they lose their job?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051188">I am sure no one can object to improving the well-being of our constituents. We have to make this program fair. Right now, it is not fair to everyone who contributes to it. I am calling on all hon. members to agree to extend sickness benefits to 50 weeks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051203">The NDP agrees with the proposals that have been put forward. It is unbelievable that sickness benefits last only 15 weeks, but that compassionate care benefits for informal caregivers last 26 weeks. Caregivers can take more time off work than sick people. This is an inconsistency in the program that must be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051204">Does my colleague agree with our party that we should reduce the number of hours required to be eligible for benefits in general, since less than 40% of unemployed workers are eligible for EI?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051206">I am wondering about something. If I am a fisher and am eligible to receive EI for seasonal work, but I happen to get sick, is it better to claim as a fisher or as someone with a serious illness? When a seasonal worker is off work, they are fortunately entitled to 50 weeks of benefits. However, if that worker falls ill, they are only entitled to 15 weeks. There is a contradiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051207">That said, the program certainly must be made available to all people who need it. For the time being, let us start by increasing benefits from 15 weeks to 50. We will propose other improvements to the program later.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051210"> Our government is proud of this long-standing program that has offered support to Canadians in times of need for 80 years. When a Canadian loses their job through no fault of their own, the EI program is there.

              <ParaText id="6051212">Since 2015, our government has made a series of changes to the employment insurance program that benefit Canadian workers across the country. For example, we reversed the 2012 changes to the employment insurance program that specified the types of jobs that unemployed workers were expected to search for and accept. The long-standing requirements that claimants must search for and accept available work while on employment insurance will continue to be upheld. This change took effect on July 3, 2016.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051213">In 2016, we also helped workers living in the regions most affected by low oil prices. We did that by temporarily extending the duration of EI regular benefits for all eligible claimants by five weeks in 15 targeted regions. Up to a maximum of 20 additional weeks were provided to long-tenured workers.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051214">That same year, we announced that as of January 1, 2017, the waiting period for EI benefits would be reduced from two weeks to one week. Today, I am able to say that as of October 1, 2019, approximately 5 million claimants combined have benefited from this change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051215">Reducing the waiting period from two weeks to one week relieves the financial burden on claimants when they need it most.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051216">In addition, about two-thirds of claimants return to work before they exhaust all of their weeks of benefit entitlement. As a result of the waiting period reduction, these claimants gain one extra week of benefits. In fact, it is estimated that this puts an additional $650 million in the pockets of Canadians annually.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051217">The reduced waiting period applies to regular, sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care, family caregiver, and fishing benefits. This means that Canadians in all workplaces are benefiting. The package of changes to the EI system does not stop there.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051218">The new measures put in place also include eliminating new entrant and re-entrant rules to increase access to EI benefits, making permanent the working-while-on-claim rules and simplifying job search responsibilities for claimants. Let me provide a little more detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051219">First, we amended the rules to eliminate the higher eligibility requirements that restricted access for new entrants and re-entrants to the labour market. Under the previous rules, new entrants and re-entrants to the labour market had to accumulate at least 910 hours of insurable employment before being eligible for employment insurance regular benefits. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051220">As a result of the changes we have made since July 3, 2016, those who enter or re-enter the workforce are subject to the same eligibility requirements as other claimants in the region where they live, namely from 420 to 700 insurable hours.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051221">Also, we made changes to working-while-on-claim rules, which help claimants stay connected to the job market and allow them to earn some additional income while receiving benefits. These improvements, which took effect August 2018, are that the 50¢-for-every-dollar-earned rule became a permanent part of the employment insurance program, and that the working-while-on-claim rules were extended to now apply to sickness and maternity benefits.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051222">We are also helping seasonal workers through a new pilot project announced in August 2018. This pilot project provides up to an additional five weeks of EI regular benefits to eligible seasonal claimants in 13 targeted regions. It is estimated that 51,500 seasonal workers will benefit from this initiative each year.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051223">Finally, we are supporting adult learners through skills boost. EI claimants now have more opportunities to go back to school to get the training they need to find new jobs without fear of losing their EI benefits. During our last mandate, we also improved conditions for workers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051224">Many Canadians are struggling to balance work, family and other personal responsibilities.

              <ParaText id="6051225">In 2017, our government introduced legislation to give federally regulated workers the right to request flexible work arrangements, such as flexible start and finish times. Subsequently, in 2018, we introduced further amendments to support even greater flexibility in the workplace. Among these changes are new breaks and leaves, including personal leave of up to five days with three days' pay. This new leave can be used for, among other things, medical appointments or sick days, or to take a dependant to a medical appointment. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051233">Of course, EI should be available for people who are not working, but what we could really do to support energy workers in Alberta is actually establish the conditions where they do not need to collect EI and they could be working. We have members of the Liberal caucus actively speaking out against the Teck Frontier project and supporting petitions opposing that project. We have members of the government caucus as well as other parties who are actively opposing these projects, which have indigenous and community support and are necessary to allow people to get back to work.</ParaText>

I was in Washington last year at a mining conference and I took the opportunity to talk with governors and senators in the U.S. about the issue of Keystone and where it was at, because on the Canadian side it had been approved and ready to go, but it was basically on the U.S. side. </ParaText>

That is where the number 26 comes from. It will make a big difference for people who are suffering. My father got cancer while he was employed. He had a hard time, because he was only allowed 15 weeks off. Increasing the benefit period to 26 weeks would help a lot. We hear what is being said today in the House, and we will see if we can do more, but the government wants to propose what we campaigned on.

              <ParaText id="6051248">The employment insurance program is one of the pillars of our social safety net. We are taking measures to ensure that it continues to serve workers and employers in a spirit of fairness and compassion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051249">Generally speaking, EI benefits are extremely effective. They fulfill the purpose for which they were created. They provide support for Canadians who are looking for a job, working to improve their skills, dealing with an illness or preparing to become a parent or caregiver. However, Canadian jobs and Canadian families are changing. This means that the program must change as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051250">As a result, we are committed to improving the employment insurance program so that it continues to serve people. Part of our government's commitment to Canadian workers includes expanding the EI sickness benefit from 15 to 26 weeks. This commitment was welcomed by the Canadian Cancer Society which said:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051252">In addition, our commitment to expand EI sickness benefits from 15 to 26 weeks matches the recommendations from the MS Society of Canada and the Community Unemployed Help Centre that were brought forward at the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051253">We have already worked hard to make improvements to the program. Let me detail a few of these now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051254"> In January 2017 we shortened the employment insurance waiting period from two weeks to one week. The goal of this change was to ease the financial strain on claimants, and I am proud to say that we reached that goal. By October 2019 about five million claimants had benefited from the reduced waiting period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051255"> Another change we made is helping to make the El program more flexible. Eligible pregnant workers are now able to receive employment insurance maternity benefits earlier, up to 12 weeks before their due date. This gives women more leeway to consider their personal, health and workplace circumstances as they decide when to start their maternity leave. As of December 2018, about 8,000 workers had made use of this new flexibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051256"> We know how challenging it can be to raise a family. That is why we improved the employment insurance parental benefits. Since December 2017 parents have been able to choose a longer parental leave at a lower benefit rate. It turns out that a lot of parents are taking advantage of this option. As of December 2018 approximately 32,000 parents had chosen the extended parental benefit option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051257">To further demonstrate the government's commitment to parents, the employment insurance parental sharing benefit was launched in March 2019. Its main objective is to promote greater gender equality in the home and workplace by encouraging parents to share parental leave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051258">More precisely, it offers an additional five weeks of employment insurance standard parental benefits reserved for a second parent. This approach is designed to create an incentive for all parents to take some leave when welcoming a new child and to share equally in the responsibility of raising their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051259"> There is also the family caregiver benefit. Our government knows that many Canadians have to take time off from work to care for a loved one. We wanted to help them as well. That is why we made changes to make employment insurance benefits for caregivers more flexible, inclusive and easier to access. These changes came into effect in December 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051260"> Caregivers can access up to 15 weeks of benefits to provide care to an adult family member with a critical illness or injury. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051261">We have also enhanced the benefits available to parents when they provide care or support to a critically ill child by extending eligibility to include additional family members who may provide care to the child. Also, in order to improve access to EI caregiving benefits, both medical doctors and nurse practitioners are now able to sign medical certificates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051262">As I mentioned, the Government of Canada is looking for ways to improve the EI program so that it meets the needs of Canadian workers. That is why changes were made to improve the sickness benefit. As of August 2018, the EI working while on claim rules were extended to EI maternity and sickness benefits, including those for eligible self-employed persons. This measure provides Canadians who are dealing with an illness or injury with greater flexibility to manage their return to work and keep more of their EI benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051263">Also, EI claimants in receipt of parental benefits, compassionate care benefits or the EI family caregiver benefit can switch to the sickness benefit if they become ill or injured while on claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051264">Finally, I want to mention one more change to the EI program. I am talking about our new EI skills boost measure, which was created to better support claimants who have lost their job after several years in the workplace. Through skills boost we are providing claimants with more opportunities to take full-time training while continuing to receive employment insurance benefits. The promotion and expansion of employment insurance flexibilities for training will encourage more claimants to upgrade their skills while receiving benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051265"> I also want to mention some important changes the Government of Canada recently made to the Canada Labour Code. These changes provide better work-life balance and strengthen labour standards protections in federally regulated private sector workplaces. Changes include new leaves such as personal leave and leave for victims of family violence, improved access to existing leave and general holiday pay, improved annual vacation entitlements and leave for traditional indigenous practices.

              <ParaText id="6051272">Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate my colleague's concern on this issue. Illness is disruptive and often devastating to families and Canadians. We know how much the EI sickness benefit means to Canadians. We know that over 400,000 Canadians utilize EI sickness benefits annually and we also know that about one-third of those Canadians max out their claim benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051273">We agree with the Canadian Cancer Society, which stated that 15 weeks is simply not enough. It does not provide the amount of time or the flexibility Canadians require, which is why this government is committed to extending the duration of EI sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 26 weeks, which is half a year, or six months. This is the first serious modernization in 40 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051274">We understand that this is a first step. This is a critical and crucial first step. We know it is just the first step, and we are committed to continuing our dialogue with the members of this House and other stakeholders across Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051279">Madam Speaker, indeed, Canadians want an EI system that is responsive and flexible. They have been waiting 40 years for changes to the system. It has been 40 years since a government has introduced any serious modernization of the EI system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051280">This government is 100% committed to modernizing EI and sickness benefits. That means reducing the EI waiting period from two weeks to one week. That means extending parental benefits and parental leave for an additional five weeks. That means making working while on claim permanent, providing flexibility to Canadians who are looking to reintegrate into the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051281">Now we are committed to extending EI sickness benefits from 15 weeks to a full 26 weeks. That is six months. This last change is absolutely critical.

              <ParaText id="6051283">The issue we are debating is a delicate one, especially for me. Yesterday, at 1:30 a.m., a close friend of the Fermont community passed away after a long struggle with illness. Her struggle was made easier because the entire community was behind her. I do not just mean the residents of Fermont, but people from Fermont who have moved all over the province and across Canada as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051284">We were all behind her. Some offered their time, while others quietly paid for her groceries or heating oil. She had a community to support and help her, but we did not talk to her about it, because she had too much pride and strength of character to accept that kind of help. That is often the case. Please forgive me if I am particularly emotional today. The ordeal this woman went through is something that my mother-in-law, my grandmother and my father went through as well. I would not wish it on anyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051285">Roughly 23% of sick people have access to these 15 weeks of benefits, so already, not many people have access to employment insurance even though this is supposed to be a universal measure. With only 23% of sick people getting better within the 15-week period, it is no longer universal, it is discriminatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051286">Illness, whether it be cancer or any other form of illness, is an ordeal for the person who is sick and for that person's friends and family. However, it is also a financial hardship. Perhaps some members have never been unemployed even once in their lives, so for those who do not know, employment insurance benefits are equal to 55% of the person's income. That is hardly a gold mine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051287">Sick people who are fighting for their health and their lives on 55% of their income are being told that they can have 15 weeks of benefits. What if they need 26 weeks to recover? Too bad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051288">However, healing requires not only family, friends, the community and money, but also good morale. It undermines people's chances of recovering when the morale is not there and when they are constantly stressed and do not know whether they will be able to put food on the table for their children the next day. That gives cancer or any other illness more power over the person's system. It has been shown that stress can have an irreparable effect on the immune system. If the immune system is already compromised and continues to grow weaker, there is less chance that the person will be able to recover from the illness or at least keep it in check. This may be difficult to understand for someone who has never been unemployed, who has never been sick or who has been lucky enough to have help. The purpose of my comments is to make members think. I am a teacher, as members know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051289">I was saying earlier that 23% of sick people will get better within 15 weeks. Most take 30 weeks to recover. That is probably why the Liberal government has suddenly agreed to increase the number of weeks of sickness benefits to 26.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051290">However, that still leaves 20% to 25% of people who will need 50 weeks or even more. That is a significant percentage. We are talking about human beings. I am not talking about 1% or 2% or even 0.5%. I am talking about 20% to 25%, or one-quarter of the population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051291">There are 338 MPs in the House. If we all became sick tomorrow, one-quarter of us would need 50 weeks. How many of us would want to be without any income from the 26th week to the final week of recovery? How many of us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051292">This is a matter of compassion, but also common sense. We have a duty to our constituents, and this is their own money. Workers and employers contribute to the fund. This is not the government's money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051293">When the employment insurance fund gets above a certain amount, the government starts dipping into it. The government needs to stop doing that. This fund exists for the future and for hard times. It is our nest egg. When the nest egg is full because regular contributions have been made day after day, year after year, we are able to provide adequate, caring and compassionate support to those around us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051294">It is unacceptable that a person without group or private insurance ends up without money at week 16, unable to pay for rent, groceries or socks in the winter. It is unacceptable that the person is unable to support themselves or others. Worse yet, that person is getting poorer. Their morale is low, and the money is no longer there. If they are lucky, they have a nest egg. If they are luckier still, they have a network to help them, and they start a fundraiser. <Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051295">Is that what Canada is? Is that the Canada we want for our people? Is that the Canada we want for the most vulnerable and marginalized members of our society?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051296">Surviving cancer is one of the biggest victories a person can have. Even more extraordinary is that all those who win their battle go on to get involved in society, volunteering in their own community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051297">How much is this help worth? How much is a life worth? How much is it worth for a person to be able to return to work and get their confidence, their honour and their pride back?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051298">We are talking about $1.1 billion if every sick person who is entitled to EI sickness benefits takes the full 50 weeks. When a person manages to heal and recover, they are eager to get back to work, because 55% of their salary is no gold mine, as I was saying. It is our duty to help our constituents, especially those who need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051299">I am calling on all hon. members to fulfill not only a duty of compassion, but also a duty of conscience and an economic duty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051328">I will structure my speech around three points: my work in the past as a political aide, which taught me certain things; the many cases that we are still seeing in our ridings these days; and, lastly, the impact that this blatant lack of compassion is having on sick people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051329">First, I was an assistant in a riding office from 2007 to 2009. People who were suffering used to come in in tears because their benefits were running out and they would no longer be getting the money they were entitled to from the plan they had contributed to. From 2009 to 2011, I worked as an assistant on the Hill, where I saw the work that the Bloc Québécois was doing. The Bloc Québécois was already working hard on this important issue at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051330">I recently had the opportunity to talk to a former MP, who reminded me of all the work that was done on this file, making it possible to really bring this and other similar bills to the fore. He even personally worked on helping pregnant women get the employment insurance benefits they deserve when they have to withdraw from the workforce because their job is too risky. In short, the Bloc has always been there speaking out on this issue, and this problem has been going on for far too long. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051331">Second, now that I am an elected official, I recently met with someone who was receiving compassionate care benefits. Let us remember that compassionate care benefits are equivalent to about 55% or 56% of a person's income and do not take into account expenses, such as adaptations to the home, medical equipment or home care workers. In a region like mine, the cost of travel must also be factored into this already long list of expenses. It is the same thing for special sickness benefits. This adds stress and really undermines the recovery of people who just need to take care of themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051332">Third, it is clear that we can measure the effects of inequality in this case. In 2016, the Coalition des Sans-Chemise called on the Liberal government to take its employment insurance reform even further and adapt the EI system to the realities of today's workers. The coalition, which brings together many associations and unions, had launched a post card campaign with the theme “Employment insurance is for everyone”, a theme that still resonates today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051333">Although the coalition commended the many improvements the Liberals made to the employment insurance system, it wanted to make the government aware of the need to overhaul the program. The coalition also asked for an increase in the number of weeks offered to workers with a serious illness. The spokesperson for the Conseil national des chômeurs et chômeuses, Pierre Céré, pointed out that caregivers can now get 26 weeks of benefits while those who are sick can get only 15 weeks. This is quite the contradiction and quite sad, honestly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051334">In December, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252623" Type="2">Beloeil—Chambly</Affiliation> was joined on Parliament Hill by the labour critic and hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252775" Type="2">Thérèse-De Blainville</Affiliation> and by Émilie Sansfaçon and Marie-Hélène Dubé, as well as their loved ones. They were calling on the government to take action and change the employment insurance system to ensure that those with a lengthy illness can get the help they are entitled to and need throughout their battle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051335">Ms. Sansfaçon thought she had beaten cancer, but when she was told that the cancer had returned, she had already exhausted all her weeks of employment insurance. She is not getting any support from the federal government and had to go into debt to deal with her illness.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051336">People need our help when they are facing adversity, not when things are going well. We know what the problem is and we also know how to solve it. There is no point in dragging our feet. We have to fix this now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051337">The Bloc Québécois decided to take up the demands of this group of citizens and have the federal government expand special EI benefits from 15 to 50 weeks to let the sick battle their illness with dignity. The program has not been enhanced since 1971 despite the demands of many stakeholders. Seven bills have been introduced to solve this problem, but nothing has ever been done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051338">Émilie Sansfaçon and Marie-Hélène Dubé chose to fight for their lives, their families, for those battling illness, but there is no reason why they should also battle the machinery of government. It is time we gave them some respite and dealt with this issue once and for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051339">I experienced a lot of heart-wrenching situations like this when I was an assistant to a member of Parliament from 2007 to 2011, and I am still seeing them in 2020. For quite some time now, I have seen that 15 weeks is not enough time to recover from an illness. Employment insurance must change to allow people to seek treatment with dignity. Again, 15 weeks of benefits is not enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051340">As you can read on the Conseil national des chômeurs et des chômeuses website, “The sickness benefit plan has not been changed since 1971, which is a long time ago!” Employment insurance must change and provide better protection for the thousands of people without group or private insurance who will go on to deal with health problems. To fix the situation, the Conseil national des chômeurs et des chômeuses is proposing to increase the sickness benefit period to 50 weeks in order to address cases of serious illness. That is what we are proposing as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051341">In closing, I cannot ignore my titles as critic for seniors, status of women and gender equality. This motion targets these groups in particular. For more fairness and less poverty for our vulnerable groups, let us take action. No one should have to choose between medicine, food and a place to live. The question is not whether we will one day be a caregiver or receive care, but when.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051360">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="253033" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051361">I was really happy to hear the last exchange between the NDP and the Bloc Québécois, on maternity assistance in particular, because this is exactly where I was going to start my discussion today to highlight something that happened in the previous session of Parliament that perhaps a lot of the new Bloc Québécois members are not informed about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051362">I was very lucky to be chosen as one of the first members to have a private member's bill. I brought forward a private member's bill in 2016 that specifically dealt with women who work in hazardous jobs and the hardships they were put through as a result of the employment insurance system when they were told they could not continue working in those hazardous conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051363">This bill called for a couple of things. It called for an increase in sick time. It called for a national maternity assistance program to look at the various ways that we could help women in hazardous working conditions, given that the labour force is changing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051364">I will say that the bill went through a lot of ups and downs. There were some discussions along the way. It did not receive unanimous support at the beginning, but it did make its way to committee. It was discussed at committee, where ideas were brought forward. It finally came back to the House, and this House almost unanimously voted in favour of it. All the Conservatives voted for it. All the NDP voted for it. All the Liberals voted for it. The Green Party member voted for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051365">Who did not vote for it? The 10 Bloc Québécois members in the House did not vote for it. They were the only members who did not support this private member's bill that was specifically about employment insurance sick leave for women who were working in hazardous jobs. I do not know why. For a while I thought they did not support it because the word “national” was in the title of the bill. I was not sure, but at the end of the day, we did not end up getting unanimous support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051366">I respect the fact that a lot of the current members of the Bloc Québécois were not here then. However, I am really glad to see that this is one of the issues that they are so focused on this time around, because it is critically important. For that matter, I want to give them credit for bringing forward this very important discussion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051367">I asked a few minutes ago about the difference between 50 or 60 weeks and 120 weeks. How did we come to 50 weeks? I did appreciate the answer. I thought I was given a really good answer by the member that specifically touched on the fact that this had to do with employment insurance benefits and what people were getting when they were going off on unemployment. It made a lot of sense to me, and I appreciate the answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051368">However, the problem is that we went into this election with a commitment. That commitment was to change from the existing 15 weeks to 26 weeks. We decided that this was the right thing to do. In fact, we saw that it was widely endorsed by various organizations and agencies, in particular those that are advocating on behalf of people who become sick or injured. For example, the Canadian Cancer Society said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051376">If we just focus this debate on talking about the time and whether 26 weeks or 50 weeks is the right number, we are going to pay a huge disservice to a lot of the other work that is going on in our country, particularly as it relates to people who become sick or injured and as a result have to take time off work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051377">I want to focus a bit of my time on talking about some of that research and some of the work that is being done to help sick people to have better lives and a better quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051378">The main agency that the government works with by funding its research is the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, in particular to look into things like finding a cure for cancer or giving people who have terminal cancer a better quality of life or making sure that people have the resources that they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051379">The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, spends $1.2 billion every year. Approximately 13,000 Canadian health researchers and trainees are supported under this program throughout the country. They research health and chronic illnesses, support the development of preventive treatments, and aim to get Canadians healthier and back to their normal lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051380">Over the last five years, the institute spent $305 million on mental health, $859 million on cancer research specifically, $522 million on cardiovascular diseases and $94 million on chronic pain. Last year in particular, the CIHR partnered with the Canadian Cancer Society for a joint $10-million investment aimed at improving the lives of those with cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051381">It is important to bring up all of this because the issue we are talking about here is not going to be solved just by giving more time and throwing more money at it. I do recognize that employment insurance has its own fund, but we need to ensure at the same time that we are helping to improve the quality of life for these individuals by making sure that we research these illnesses and chronic illnesses so that we can give people better treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051382">I want to give a couple of examples relating to cancer specifically. The money that is being used through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research is working to improve the lives of cancer survivors. Often this includes long-term treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. Patients have to go through these treatments for several months, and they involve a lot of hospital visits and sick days. The patient, the family, and the caregiver have to endure a lot of hardship as a result. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051383">We also know the economic impact of living with cancer. We need to pay more attention to the economic effects that cancer has on individuals. I know I am running out of time, but I wanted to highlight what is being done in terms of ensuring that research and resources are put towards cancer specifically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051384">Research is also being done on chronic pain. One in five Canadians lives with chronic pain. It is one of the most common reasons that people seek health care in Canada. The economic impact of chronic pain on this country is estimated to be $56 billion a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051385">In 2019, the government established the Canadian pain task force, which is tasked with better defining the causes of chronic pain and providing recommendations to Health Canada with respect to prevention and management. The objective is to reduce the overall impact of chronic pain. This is where the Canadian Institutes of Health Research comes into play. It funds organizations such as these to make sure that we do the research that we need to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051386">As I indicated a few moments ago, it is vitally important that we look not just at EI. Based on the private member's bill that I discussed before, I am always interested in having a discussion about the employment insurance system and how we can improve upon it. However, at the same time, it is important that we look at how we can better the lives of individuals from a research perspective to give them a better quality of life and better care during the time of their illness, whether it is cancer or chronic pain, the two examples that I have used.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051391">Madam Speaker, this is what I was trying to address. It is not just about the time that is being assigned to EI sick benefits. It is also about a government taking the responsibility of researching and looking into how to give people a better quality of life. The research and the product that is produced as a result of it can be used in addition to things like employment insurance to better the quality of life for individuals. From my perspective, that is what is important. It is more of a holistic approach, as opposed to saying that 50 weeks, 26 weeks or 80 weeks is the answer. We need to look at this a lot more holistically to find out how to improve the lives of people dealing with these illnesses, in particular when they are in the workforce.</ParaText>

As we found out over the weekend, he paid to have a petition from Queen's University put forward that asks to get rid of the Teck Frontier project. If we took more people off of employment insurance, there would be more room for people who need it, like people who are injured or have cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051393">Does the member think what he is doing right now is appropriate, using taxpayer-funded dollars to ensure that people in Alberta and Saskatchewan do not have jobs so they will be on unemployment longer? He is using money from his office to ensure that Canadians are not working. I do not think that is right. Does he?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6051401">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak today to the motion on employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051402">First, I would like to say that more people have come off employment insurance in the last four years than ever before. In fact, one million more jobs were created in the last four years, creating the lowest unemployment rate this country has ever seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051403">The employment insurance program pays billions of dollars in benefits to over two million Canadians every year, including to constituents I represent in Surrey Centre. It is one of the most important programs that make up the foundation of our social support system. The employment insurance system provides essential support to workers who have lost their jobs without being responsible for this, to those who cannot work due to illness or pregnancy and to those who have been absent from work to care for a newborn baby, recently adopted child or a seriously ill family member. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051404">An essential component of the EI program is the EI sickness benefit that helps Canadians who are unable to work because of illness, injury or quarantine. Currently, this program provides up to 15 weeks of income replacement. While a majority of Canadians are able to return to work before the end of the 15-week period, about 36% exhaust the full amount before they are able to go back to work. That is why our government and our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have included expanding EI sickness benefits to the minister's mandate letter and why our government is committed to expanding the EI sickness benefit from 15 weeks to 26 weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051405">This is an important initiative. It means Canadians will receive financial support at a time when they need to heal and can return as contributing members to the workforce without having suffered undue financial hardship. This commitment was lauded by the Canadian Cancer Society, which said, “The proposed extension would support Canadians who have been diagnosed with cancer and need to take time away from work to seek treatment.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051406">Canadian workers benefit from a dynamic employment insurance program that is designed to automatically adapt to changes affecting the unemployment rate of an employment insurance economic region. This helps to ensure that people who live in regions with similar labour markets are treated the same, with the amount of assistance provided adjusted to changing labour market conditions. In regions and communities across Canada, our employment insurance program provides income security to our families and workers during periods of unemployment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051407">Of course, it also provides support to seasonal workers during periods of unemployment. Our government understands the importance of seasonal industries for the success of our country as well as the reality of seasonal workers. Significant sectors, such as the construction industry, agriculture, forestry and fishing, contribute to Canada's economic prosperity. That is why we are working so hard to support these industries and their workers from coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051408">The recent decline in unemployment rates in some EI economic regions has resulted in an increase in the number of hours of insurable employment that is required to qualify for regular EI benefits. This increase has resulted in a reduction in the number of weeks of benefits to which claimants are eligible in these regions. This means that some seasonal workers stop receiving EI regular benefits before they are called back to their seasonal job. We know that regions such as eastern Quebec and Atlantic Canada are more severely affected by this lack of income, which is often referred to as the “black hole”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051409">We sympathize with the workers who find themselves in this situation every year, and I can tell members that our government is closely examining measures to be taken to help these workers. We are working with stakeholders to find solutions to this problem. Our government is committed to improving the employment insurance program to better meet the needs of workers and employers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051410">When I was a teen, I worked on my uncle's farm in the summer picking blueberries. I saw how hundreds of farm workers helped harvest fruit and produce during the spring and summer and relied on EI during the winters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051411">Many of the changes we have made over the past four years are already in place and can help seasonal workers. For example, in 2018 we made permanent the rule allowing recipients to keep 50¢ of every dollar earned during the benefit period, and we extended this to maternity and sickness benefits. We also provided five additional weeks to regular benefits to eligible seasonal workers in 13 targeted regions. We estimate that approximately 51,000 seasonal workers will benefit from this measure each year. This government listens and helps Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051412">We have provided opportunities for eligible claimants to upgrade their skills and increase their employability while receiving their benefits. In particular, we have provided up to $41 million over two years to implement, in collaboration with the provinces and territories, wage subsidies and professional training and employment assistance programs for workers in seasonal industries through labour market development agreements. We are committed to improving the job security of seasonal workers and providing them with more support, especially when employment insurance is interrupted due to a changing job market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051413">In this regard, we will enhance a recent pilot project that has provided additional assistance to tens of thousands of seasonal workers. At the conclusion of this pilot project, we will set up an ongoing program to give seasonal workers greater and more reliable benefits. These benefits will help them better meet their needs and those of their families between work seasons. We will also collaborate with Statistics Canada to strengthen data collection on local labour markets so that employment insurance can better take into account the realities on the ground, particularly in rural and diverse regions where this is needed the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051414">We are aware of the modern realities of the current job market. Society is changing and so is the employment insurance system. It needs to continue to meet the needs of workers and employers. It is a question of balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051415">I want my colleagues to understand that our government has committed and remains committed to supporting Canadians from coast to coast to coast when they need it. We have promised to reform the employment insurance system and that is what we are doing. That is why we are working so hard to improve the benefits and supports that Canadian workers receive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051416">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051417">We are not close-minded in the Bloc Québécois. We gladly welcome the additional provisions, for seasonal work, for example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051418">I am from Charlevoix, and from Isle-aux-Coudres specifically. It is only accessible by ferry. I am quite familiar with the notions of worker retention and employment insurance. I welcome our friend's announcement about the additional weeks of benefits provided through training. I acknowledge that this will be helpful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051419">I would, however, like to get back to the topic of employment insurance for serious illnesses. We cannot expect a worker to come work in the region, in Isle-aux-Coudres, in Charlevoix, on a seasonal basis without some sort of guarantee of peace of mind and the assurance of being insured. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051420">When we invite workers, whether they are newcomers or people leaving urban centres in search of fresh air, they do not want to lose any economic status. We really go all out to try and encourage people to come and work in the regions. Then we have to tell them that, if they fall ill, they only have 15 weeks to recover. After that, they can either die or get better, because they do not get any more. That is a real problem, because people say that they would have liked to come and work, but perhaps some other time. They turn their backs and disappear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051421">The big question at the heart of the motion that we are introducing today is also an economic issue for the regions. There is a direct impact. If we do not arrange to fix EI so we can reassure people who want to come work in the regions, we are going to compromise the regions economically and jeopardize their economic vitality. That point has not been raised much today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051422">There have been a lot of emotional speeches, and I can do that too. Our colleagues opposite are really fond of figures, so we are going to give them some. They have to understand that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051423">Given that my colleague seems to be open to seasonal work, I wanted to ask him whether he can guarantee that his party is open to giving sick workers 50 weeks of benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051424">That does not mean that sick people will use 50 weeks as a matter of course. As my friend was saying earlier, people are eager to go back to work. Nevertheless, we want to make sure that people who are very sick have 50 weeks to get better.</ParaText>

They are for short periods of time and are very labour-intensive jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051426">When it comes to time off during sickness, I have a close friend who recently went for routine back surgery and was nearly paralyzed due to it. His wife is having to take time off. Her whole world changed. This was supposed to routine surgery, with him being out in a couple of days. Now she does not know when he will walk again or if he will ever walk again. She will need a significant amount of time off.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051428">Obviously this will not cover everyone, but it will give them time to readjust. It helps those with a long-term sickness or those have loved ones with a long-term sickness.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House call on the government to increase the special Employment Insurance sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 50 weeks in the upcoming budget in order to support people with serious illnesses, such as cancer.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051437">We say “such as cancer” because, according to the figures that were circulated earlier, it is a significant target. However, we are not just talking about cancer. We want the act to be amended to increase benefits for adults with a serious illness from 15 weeks to 50 weeks, or more, if the government wishes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051438">As members can see, we are deeply committed to this issue, as are many members of other political parties and a majority of the public. Most of us are moving in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051439"> For the past three months, the current government has been saying that it wants to compromise and work with the opposition. In good faith, we in the Bloc Québécois are inclined to believe it. For the government, improving employment insurance presents a wonderful opportunity to act on this desire for partnership and to show that we are capable of working in a non-partisan way for the benefit of all our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051440">During the last election campaign, the government said that it was in favour of increasing employment insurance benefits from 15 to 26 weeks. We said this before, but we will say it again: kudos. It is a step in the right direction, but it is clearly not enough for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051441">Why do we need to amend this legislation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051442">First of all, it is completely outdated. It came into force in 1971, and there have been no major adjustments since. That was 50 years ago, and a lot has happened in the past 50 years. Society has evolved, and, more importantly, needs have changed. In fact, over the past 50 years, there have been many employment insurance bills aimed specifically at amending the 15 weeks of sickness benefits, but none of them passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051443">Since 2002 alone, there was Bill <Document DbId="321702" Type="4">C-442</Document> to improve the employment insurance system, introduced by Yvon Godin, a former NDP member for Bathurst. That was followed in 2004 by Bill <Document DbId="1465071" Type="4">C-278</Document>, introduced by Paule Brunelle, a former Bloc Québécois member for Trois-Rivières.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051444">In 2006, Mr. Godin reintroduced his bill, this time as Bill C-406. That same year, there was Bill <Document DbId="2162674" Type="4">C-269</Document>, introduced by former Bloc Québécois member Johanne Deschamps with the same objectives. In 2011, as we mentioned a couple of times this morning, there was also Bill <Document DbId="5125614" Type="4">C-291</Document>, which was introduced by Denis Coderre, the former Liberal member for Bourassa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051445">In short, bill after bill has tried and failed to amend the sickness provisions of this EI legislation or to bring them in line with a reality that, over time, had become quite different from what it was in 1971. Given that this issue has been dragging on for all these years, is it not time to settle it once and for all? Is it not time to stop dithering and take action?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051446">Here is another reason we need to change this legislation. Statistics show that one out of every two claimants does not return to work after 15 weeks off. In other words, one out of every two people dealing with a serious illness needs much more time for treatment or recovery than the 15 weeks that are currently provided.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051447">There is another reason to make this change. In a 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court said that the employment insurance power must be interpreted generously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051448">What is more, let us not forget that, when it comes to employment insurance, Canada is the least generous country in the G7, with the exception of the United States, which is a completely different context. If we look at the percentage of GDP that is spent by each country, we see that Belgium devotes 3.6% of its GDP to employment insurance, while Canada devotes only 0.65%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051449">Portugal devotes 3.5% of its GDP to employment insurance. Ireland and Spain devote 2.7% of their GDP to employment insurance, and Denmark devotes 2.2%. I would remind members that Canada devotes only 0.65% of its GDP to employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051450">On top of that, employment insurance in many of these countries does not last a mere 15 or 26 weeks as the Liberals are proposing. People in these countries can receive employment insurance benefits for one to three years. That is a far cry from our 15 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051451">Common sense, compassion, equity and social justice are some other reasons to amend this outdated act. The government needs to treat its people right. Treating people right means recognizing the importance of workers, respecting them and making up for the injustices of life. Getting sick and having to take months and months off work is not a choice, it is an injustice of life. We have the duty and power in the House to take quick action to correct this long-standing injustice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051452">In closing, as an old Tuareg proverb says, in the desert of life, the strong must help the weak because those who are strong today may be weak tomorrow.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051453">Madam Speaker, I have listened a great deal to many of the Bloc members, and a couple of things have surfaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051454"> One example is the situation where those members have been factually incorrect. For example, I commented on the statement that seasonal workers were entitled to 50 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051455"> Here is another example that I would like to share with the member. The members have said that 23% of those who receive the benefits get better within that 15-week period. It is almost three times that number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051456"> Having factual information is of great benefit during this type of a debate. I wonder if my colleague and friend from the Bloc could reflect on the importance that we have the facts and that we provide them in this debate.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6051460">Madam Speaker, there are a couple things to keep in mind in this debate. For a period of time, the Paul Martin administration took $54 billion of employment insurance and put the money into general revenue. It is a fact that employment insurance is not really the government's money; it comes from employees and employers and we are just custodians of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051461">My question is with regard to the extension of benefits. We have seen the improvement to maternity leave, going from one year to one and a half years. People can take that one and a half years, but their benefits are then stretched over the extra time. They are not actually increased, and that is a sad thing. When somebody is off for a longer period of time, not only is it good for the child but also for the employee, because that time allows someone to have a stable job for much longer and his or her skills get better. Therefore, it is better for our economy, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051462">I would ask the member to comment on the fact that if we extend these benefits, the training, expertise and stability in the workforce are also improved, which makes us more competitive as a nation. It is very much an improvement for our economy in that way, too.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051464">Madam Speaker, I am honoured and pleased to speak to the motion moved by the leader of the Bloc Québécois, which is now before the House under business of supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051465">This motion is as clear as can be and deserves the unanimous support of all parties in the House. The government should be guided by logic and compassion on this matter, and it should set aside partisan imperatives that detract from this extremely important issue. Let me therefore say that I sincerely hope we will come together to adopt this motion, making it the first step toward a major change to the Employment Insurance Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051466">The wording of the motion is very simple: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051467">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House call on the government to increase the special Employment Insurance sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 50 weeks in the upcoming budget in order to support people with serious illnesses, such as cancer.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051468">As we all know, the government is currently holding extensive pre-budget consultations aimed at informing the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s reflections on the important budget speech he will deliver in the House before too long. This important exercise includes its share of issues that are fundamental to the well-being of the population. It is time for the government to seize this opportunity and show some compassion for people with serious illnesses, particularly cancer. I could build a very detailed and convincing argument in that regard and I am confident that common sense would prevail amongst the members of all parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051469">The motion we are debating is quite simple. EI has always been at the core of the concerns and progressive positions developed by the Bloc Québécois over the years. The Bloc Québécois has always fought to improve and enhance the EI system, including creating an independent fund, eliminating the black hole, improving access to regular benefits, ending the classification of unemployed workers based on the claims submitted to the program and, obviously, increasing all types of benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051470">Right now, anyone who has been around a person diagnosed with cancer can see that the special EI benefits for serious illnesses are baffling and absurd. No one in the House can say they have never faced this difficult, stressful reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051471">The current system is blatantly unfair to different categories of EI recipients. Some colleagues have already raised concerns or questions about our proposal to extend the existing benefits system from 15 to 50 weeks. I do not think it could get any simpler than that. It is a matter of social justice and equity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051472">Speaking of equity, I would like to talk about a problem faced by one of my constituents with a serious illness. She was diagnosed with two autoimmune diseases. Her life was turned upside down in a matter of six months. She was entitled to 15 weeks of EI sickness benefits, but that was not enough. After the 15 weeks were up, she ended up on social assistance. That is completely unacceptable. She was battling her illnesses and also battling the system to get benefits so that she could pay her rent and grocery bills. This situation is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051473">According to an in-depth study on the issue by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the 15 weeks of special EI sickness benefits were originally based on survey data from the Department of Employment and Social Development. According to those data, roughly 23% of claimants return to work immediately following the 15 weeks of benefits. Of the remaining claimants, 82% would take an additional 16 weeks off or more before returning to work. This is a serious situation, as everyone will agree. These people have to struggle not only with illness, but also with immense stress due to financial insecurity. Living on a reduced income is stressful for anyone, but for someone who is also facing a life-threatening health problem, the stress can become unbearable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051474">As its name suggests, the employment insurance system provides insurance of a certain income threshold in the event of job loss or forced absence due to extraordinary circumstances.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051475">Since the creation of the special sickness benefits program nearly 50 years ago, the labour market as a whole has evolved significantly. The day-to-day reality of millions of individuals has transformed, but very little has changed in terms of the urgent challenge of achieving work-life balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051476">Currently, a person who is laid off is entitled to regular employment insurance benefits. The birth or arrival of a child also triggers maternity leave or parental leave. However, if a worker finds out they have a serious illness that requires frequent or prolonged leave, the current system provides the same number of weeks of benefits as for a worker who has to take leave to recover from a physical injury such as a fracture, which ultimately will not jeopardize their long-term future or general health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051477">This is where there is a problem with the program, and this results in blatant unfairness for people who only want to get better as quickly as possible. No one wants to be ill. No one wants to go through such a challenging situation. It is unthinkable that anyone would want to be ill, to be diagnosed with cancer. I keep coming back to cancer, but the situation and the state of mind is the same for any long-term chronic illness. Cancer is a prime example because it affects almost everyone. It is a real tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051478">This difficult reality means that a person who receives such news already has to deal with the shock, which can take many weeks to internalize. There are immense emotional consequences. It is not difficult to imagine the range of terrible emotions that overwhelm an individual when they receive that kind of diagnosis. This is when the full scope of the problem comes into play as does the compassionate approach long recommended by the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051479">This is not the first time that our party has called for better access to EI benefits for constituents dealing with a serious illness. The Bloc has taken action at least three times in the recent past by introducing bills to overhaul the act and to enhance benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051480">Members may recall Paul Crête fighting tirelessly for this for years and former Bloc Québécois MPs Jean-François Fortin and Robert Carrier picking up where he left off. Right from the beginning of this important debate, the Bloc was equally open to other parties, calling for a non-partisan approach to this crucial issue that would seek only to correct a terrible injustice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051481">For example, we supported a similar bill sponsored by Denis Coderre when he was in the House. We can all agree that a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then and that this is not a new cause for the Bloc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051482">Unfortunately, we have always come up against unwillingness on the part of both Liberal and Conservative governments to consider fixing this serious problem. Worse still, recent governments have been influenced by financial considerations, citing budget cuts to justify the unjustifiable. Just imagine the cold heartlessness of that approach when a person's health or very life is at stake. It is abominable, despicable even.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051483">I could also highlight another disappointing aspect of the current program by describing in detail the accessibility of caregiver benefits. There is a huge contradiction in compassionate leave. It is easy to imagine the insecurity and distress that a diagnosis of cancer or severe illness causes to the person's family. That is precisely why the caregiver benefits are an integral part of the benefit program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051484">The reality is quite different. Comparatively speaking, the benefits for caregivers are currently more advantageous than the framework established for someone who is seriously ill. A caregiver providing end-of-life care can technically receive benefits for longer than the current 15 weeks that patients with cancer or any other serious illness are allowed. How very ironic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051485">All avenues must be explored, and I would humbly submit that we consider the astronomical surpluses in the employment insurance fund. Everything leads us to believe that a fair balance is within reach. We just need everyone's goodwill in order to achieve it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051486">I firmly believe that there is a strong spirit of collaboration in this House that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cares deeply about. He has a golden opportunity right in front of him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051487">For the sake of the sick, we must do the right thing. We must demonstrate compassion and fairness. The House must unanimously pass the motion sponsored by the leader of the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>

That has happened through consultations and working with the different stakeholders. It is a significant change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051489">Does my friend across the way not agree that maybe the Bloc would have been better off to present a motion to have the issue go to a committee where we could look at all of the different aspects of EI?

If we are to be judged by the last four years, we have been very progressive at making some positive changes for Canada's workers and others.</ParaText>

I worked with him for years. He was very solid on the industry committee with respect to so many consumer issues, as well as this issue. I would like to give a special shout-out to one person who was not mentioned and that is Yvon Godin, the former member for <Affiliation DbId="252487" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>. He definitely tabled the most bills in this chamber to improve employment insurance and spoke to it often. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051494">What I think we see differently from the government is that this is not the government's money. It is the workers' and employers' money in a relationship to provide good, stable employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051495"> By moving it in this direction, in many respects, I believe this is going to be of benefit to employers, because they can get more stability for replacement employees during the process as well as have workers come back to work in a better state of mind, because their life and family are taken care of at home. I do not think that should be underestimated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051502">I am pleased to rise today to speak to the motion. The employment insurance program is an important part of Canada's social security net. With every paycheque, Canadian workers have spent years paying into the employment insurance program. Whether it is due to job loss, parental leave or sickness, Canadians who have contributed to this program should have confidence that the program benefits are available to them when they need them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051503">As legislators we owe it to Canadians to ensure that the EI program is not only fair, flexible and supportive, but that it is also a viable program in the long term. The motion before us today calls special attention to the employment insurance sickness benefits. The current structure of this program provides up to 15 weeks of sickness benefits to eligible employees who are unable to work for medical reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051504">I have no doubt in my mind that every member in this chamber understands the value of this benefit. We have all dealt with it personally, or experienced it through a loved one, or at least known someone who was unable to work because of a serious illness or a medical condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051505">We can surely find agreement that when someone is faced with serious illness, the person's focus and energy is better spent on recovery and not worrying about making ends meet. As we have heard in this place, the current 15-week benefit threshold was established in 1971 and almost 50 years later there is certainly merit in reviewing the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051506">In the previous Parliament and now again in this Parliament, I have had the privilege of being a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, better known as the HUMA committee. This committee has the latitude to review the EI sickness benefits program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051507"> In the previous Parliament, in its “Supporting Families After the Loss of a Child” report, the HUMA committee recommended that the government gather data specific to employment insurance sickness benefits used to support bereavement and high-risk pregnancy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051508">Also, in its “Taking Action: Improving the Lives of Canadians Living with Episodic Disabilities” report, the HUMA committee made specific recommendations to improve the EI program's ability to meet the needs of Canadians living with episodic disabilities and their families. Allowing workers to claim benefits in smaller units, such as hours or days, instead of weeks was just one option that was put forward in this report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051509">This recommendation shows that there is room to modernize and improve the flexibility of the EI sickness benefit to better support Canadians living with an episodic disability. These two studies, as well as other work done by the HUMA committee, demonstrated the merit of a full review of the EI sickness benefit program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051510">In fact, in the previous Parliament, on multiple occasions, one of my NDP colleagues moved a motion to that effect. That motion specifically called on the HUMA committee to review the employment insurance sickness benefits as it relates to current program outcomes, the impacts of the current structure and its accessibility. The motion had my support and that of my Conservative colleagues, but it was very unfortunate that on every single occasion the motion was moved, the Liberal members of the committee who had the majority shut down the debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051511">Understanding the success and the failures of any program is vital in shaping a better program. We do not have a comprehensive study to lean on today in considering this motion, but maybe we would have if in the previous Parliament my NDP colleague's motion had not been shut down time and time again.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051512">That is why I would strongly support the HUMA committee undertaking a comprehensive review of this program. Equipped with a full review of the EI sickness benefit program, we could help ensure that we make the necessary changes to the program so that the program delivered is in the interests of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051513">Today's motion suggests that a new maximum sickness benefit be set to 50 weeks in the upcoming budget, but there are many considerations to be made in changing this program that are not addressed in this motion. I would note the other proposals that have been made to modernize this program from previous committee reports. It is important that we consider the increased cost to employer and employee premiums.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051514">Despite the sunny portrait that is often painted by the current Liberal government, constituents in my riding are faced with a hard reality. We do not even have to look past the two main economic drivers in my region to understand that reality. Our energy sector is being crushed by the Liberal government, and our farmers and agricultural producers are constantly finding themselves on the losing end of the government's failed policies and failed leadership. Layoffs and unemployment are a real possibility for many of my constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051515">It would be wholly irresponsible to not fully evaluate and understand the impact of increased premiums. We also have to consider that not all Canadians are eligible for EI program benefits. In fact, one-fifth of working Canadians do not qualify for the EI program. They would not benefit from this motion that is proposed today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051516">This, in turn, raises the question of whether the EI program is the best support system to help Canadians dealing with serious illness. Again, as a member of the HUMA committee, I do hope that we can have the opportunity to review this program, an opportunity to hear from the experts and those who are or who work with those directly affected by this program, so that we can ensure that the EI program continues to be there when Canadians need it, that we are not undermining the fiscal viability of that program, that changes to the program do not have other unintended economic impacts, and, of course, that in reforming the program, we are making the program more fair, flexible and supportive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051517">I appreciate that today's motion highlights these important issues. It gives us an opportunity to evaluate the EI program in the House, but I do hope we have the opportunity for a more thorough evaluation of it, so that any modernizations to the program are quality modernizations and that we ensure that the EI program works effectively for Canada and all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051538">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House call on the government to increase the special Employment Insurance sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 50 weeks in the upcoming budget in order to support people with serious illnesses, such as cancer. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051539">The aim of this motion is interesting, for I do believe it is important to take care of Canadians who have a serious illness. However, why does it call for 50 weeks? I do not know, and I cannot answer that question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051540">On February 5, I made a statement in the House reminding members of the need to review the special EI sickness benefits, and gave the example of Émilie Sansfaçon, a constituent of mine who lives in Saint-Augustin. This morning I saw her father sitting in the gallery, facing the Bloc Québécois. He came to listen to what the House of Commons was saying on this matter. Ms. Sansfaçon received two cancer diagnoses in the span of a single year. In a heartfelt plea, she called on all political parties to review the current maximum benefit period of 15 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051541">During the election campaign, I met with her father, Mr. Sansfaçon, to get his side of the story. I obviously promised to take concrete action to improve things for these Canadians who are diagnosed with a serious illness that forces them to be away from work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051542">The current employment insurance sickness benefit program was established in 1971. That is nearly 50 years ago. Maybe that is where the 50 weeks the Bloc Québécois is asking for came from: since it has been 50 years, the Bloc is asking for 50 weeks. If it had been 70 years, would they have asked for 70 weeks? I do not know, but I wonder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051543">Obviously, the legislation needs to change. Ms. Sansfaçon has been very courageous considering she has to deal with this serious illness. As I said in the House on February 5, this young woman, and all Canadians with a serious illness, should have the privilege of focusing on their well-being and the care they need instead of the financial concerns that crop up once the 15 weeks of benefits come to an end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051544">What is absurd about the 15 weeks of sickness benefits is that chemotherapy treatments last at least six months. That was the case for Ms. Sansfaçon after she was diagnosed with cancer the first time. When her benefits ran out, she had to remortgage her house and she asked her family for financial assistance after exhausting her line of credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051545">I don't claim to be a doctor, but according to the medical guidance, a patient should convalesce for three months after having chemotherapy to return to full health. Ms. Sansfaçon had to return to work less than a week after the end of her treatments because she had no other choice. She could no longer cope financially. Even worse, five months later she learned that the cancer had returned and that it was stage four and inoperable, having metastasized to the lungs. She can no longer live without chemotherapy and her days are numbered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051546">As we all know, this is unfortunately not the only young woman who has or will have to deal with this illness, or I would say this cursed illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051547">I will cite the statistics published by the Canadian Cancer Society. According to the 2016 data that was recently published, cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada. It is responsible for 30% of all deaths, compared to 19% caused by heart disease. It is expected that one in two Canadians, or 45% of men and 43% of women, will develop cancer in their lifetimes. One in four Canadians, or 26% of men and 23% of women, is expected to die of cancer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051548">Thanks to advances in medicine and increasingly effective treatments, it is now possible to cure roughly 60% of cancers. With continuing medical research, this number will undoubtedly increase and treatments will take less and less time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051549">Right now, the majority of cancers require extended treatments that take more than 15 weeks—not to mention other serious illnesses and medical conditions that require long periods of treatment and recovery. It is appalling how the Liberal government keeps flushing taxpayer money down the drain. It is handing out gifts to Mastercard and Loblaws and buying pipelines. Well, it is not a matter of money anymore. The government needs to take concrete action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051550">I wonder what happened to the government's compassion. The negative health impacts of stress have been proven. I think it is cruel to create more stress for Canadians who have been or will be diagnosed with a serious illness requiring more than 15 weeks of treatment or recovery. Getting the bad news is stressful, the treatment itself is stressful, and there is financial stress on top of that. In 2020, I think Canada can be there to help these people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051551">The Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities should take an in-depth look at EI sickness benefits to make sure they meet the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051552">Canada and the U.S. have the two least generous systems, with 15 weeks. Let us compare with other countries. Germany, for example, another G7 country, provides 72 weeks of benefits with the possibility of extending for up to 3 years. France has up to 360 days over a non-recurring 3-year period. Italy offers 50% of daily benefits for the first 17 days and 66% thereafter; there is then a 3-day waiting period for a total of 180 eligible days. Japan offers benefits matching two-thirds of standard daily wages for up to 18 months. The United Kingdom does not rely solely on employment insurance. They have another system and two different types of benefits: one based on employer and employee contributions, and another based on revenue and resources. There is no time limit for the payment of revenue-based support benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051553">Here is what I am getting at: Why does the motion mention 50 weeks? I mentioned a few countries, but there are many more examples out there. Other members talked about different systems in other jurisdictions. Why did the Bloc pick 50 weeks?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051554">This is a matter that must be acted on responsibly. We have to take the necessary steps to get the right answers and treat Canadians well. There has to be a will, there has to be an intent and it has to be a priority. The government simply has to be genuinely compassionate and specifically want to help people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051555">I see my time is running out, so I will skip right to the conclusion. I have questions for my Bloc Québécois colleagues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051556">What data did they use to come up with 50 weeks, when the Canadian Cancer Society only asked for 26 weeks? Surely the folks at the Canadian Cancer Society deal with seriously ill people on a more regular basis than members of the Bloc. I put more faith in the Canadian Cancer Society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051557">What solution does the Bloc Québécois have for people who do not qualify for employment insurance? They are Canadians too, and they are also entitled to assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051558">I am perfectly willing to work with the government to find the best system and determine the right number of weeks to support the thousands of Canadians who have been diagnosed with cancer, like Émilie Sansfaçon, who lives in my riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051565">If we look at history, we have to go back as far as 1971. There have been Liberal and Conservative governments. There has never ben a Bloc Québécois government so we cannot know what their intentions were. The two parties that have been in power since then moved with the times. Now it is 2020.

              <ParaText id="6051582">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252703" Type="2">Beauport—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île d'Orléans—Charlevoix</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051583">I add my voice to those of my colleagues to emphasize the importance of this motion regarding special EI benefits. I do so in all seriousness. I am not convinced that the member who spoke before me was being very serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051584">The first example, which we have been speaking about at length, is cancer. According to Canadian Cancer Society statistics from 2019, breast cancer survival rates have increased by 48% since 1986. However, it is the second most frequently diagnosed type of cancer. Nearly half of all Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. My mother died of cancer over 20 years ago. At the time, one in 10 people would be diagnosed with cancer. Now it is one in two. Lastly, also according to the Canadian Cancer Society, nearly one in four people will die of cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051585">There are many inconsistencies in the EI system, since it has been butchered in the past. We have tinkered with they system. Why not keep tinkering with it to help people who need it because they are ill?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051586">I would like to point out another inconsistency and injustice with respect to the sickness benefit versus the compassionate care benefit. In the socio-demographic context of an aging population, the role of caregivers, more than 60% of whom are women, is key when discussing care for the sick and elderly. It was only right to create the compassionate care benefit. It has a maximum benefit of 26 weeks. It must be said that it is unusual that an individual suffering from a serious illness cannot receive the same number of weeks of benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051587">I will now talk about a situation that is not entirely hypothetical. A caregiver taking care of a seriously ill person suggests that they spend a week down south to escape the cold winter weather and storms. To feel better and take a refreshing break, these people decide to go on a trip. The caregiver can leave the country without losing their compassionate care benefits, but the person who is ill would lose that week of benefits. That week of benefits would not be paid. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051588">I believe that we all have a responsibility to give sick people a chance to heal. Illness does not discriminate. Illness is everywhere, and it does not only strike people who have wage loss insurance or critical illness insurance. A worker who is seriously ill must be able to focus on getting to remission and, if possible, making a full recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051589">People grappling with illness face all kinds of difficult situations. For example, they have to rearrange their daily routines in their personal and professional lives, they see an inevitable drop in income and they have to cover the costs associated with hospital visits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051590">Let us try to imagine what thousands of patients are going through. I invite my colleagues to take a moment to consider what 15 weeks looks like in real life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051591">In week one, the patient is diagnosed with stage II colorectal cancer, or perhaps with what is initially considered an inoperable pancreatic cancer. The doctor encourages the patient to seek treatment and comes up with a clinical picture. The patient and their loved ones are left in shock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051592">The following week, the patient gets their schedule for the first three-week cycle of chemotherapy. Their loved ones are responsive, taking turns keeping the children on schedule. The administrative aspects of the patient's work absence are taken care of. The patient's spouse takes compassionate leave and provides support. Together, they are earning $803 a week before taxes. They have two kids who are old enough to understand what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051593">In week four, a check-up shows promising results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051594">In week five, the patient starts a new cycle of chemo. The next few weeks are a time of increased weakness, lethargy, hair loss, chronic fatigue and worried looks. The anxiety and dark thoughts are overwhelming.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051595"> In week nine, the second cycle is complete. The results are promising, however, and the medical follow-up changes. The tumour is now operable. The patient then has to prepare by eating well, getting as much rest as possible and keeping their spirits up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051596">In week 11, it is finally time to operate. The doctor is confident. The patient is exhausted but full of hope. There are some minor post-operative complications, but nothing too serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051597">In week 12, the patient goes home. That is when their family's financial situation really hits them. In the struggle to stay alive, they had not allowed themselves to pay much attention to financial matters. Then comes the inevitable: in two weeks, the benefits will stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051598">The patient's spouse might be able to stay home for a few more weeks, but with the patient's health improving, will the compassionate care benefits get cut? Can the household continue to function with a taxable income of $573 per week? What if the patient were a single parent?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051599">The next form that the patient would need to fill out would be a welfare application, as my colleague alluded to earlier. That is what the 15-week period leads to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051600">Is it not enough that patients have to deal with follow-up appointments, future treatments and their many side effects, anxiety, sadness, children and loved ones? Must we also add to their struggles by denying them 50 weeks of sickness benefits? Must we really wait until June 2020 to consider this in committee? Is it not time to act? We can do it now. The vote is tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051601">I remind the House that it has been 12 years since the $57 million surplus was taken from the employment insurance fund by the federal government and transferred to general revenue. It has to end. That money was paid by workers and employers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051602">I will exercise some restraint and not utter the word that springs to mind when the $57 million taken by the government are mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051603">Thanks to breakthroughs in medical research, people with serious illnesses have a glimmer of hope. Tales of victory and survival are no longer as rare as they once were. We all have survivors in our personal and professional circles. There are even some right here in this House. Going back to a normal life also means going back to work and to a daily routine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051604">As my party's critic for the environment, I must talk about the links between the environment and health. It is imperative to once again underscore in this House how important it is to look at this issue in terms of environmental issues. If we take a frank and honest look at the situation, given that we have workers dealing with serious illnesses, it has to be part of the discussion. Everybody's health, and workers' health specifically in this case, will be bound up more and more closely with environmental issues in the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051605">I will give a bit more information on that subject. We talked about research this afternoon. Let us see what the results are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051606">According to the Canadian Medical Association, air pollution causes 21,000 premature deaths each year. Those were people who were already sick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051607">Last year, the scientific journal Epidemiology published conclusive research from McGill University's Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health. The data are significant. Nanoparticles from fuels and volatile pollutants increase the risk of brain cancer by 10%. Rising rates of thyroid cancers over the last 30 years show links between health, pollution and the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051608">Lastly, The Lancet, a scientific journal that is renowned as a leading authority, publishes reports that are now in their fourth edition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051609">Given all these results, how can anyone justify maintaining the same 15-week period we have had since 1996?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051610">I will conclude by saying that human decency is knocking on the government's door today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051611">Many people have rallied to fight cancer and other serious illnesses and were unable to access EI benefits that fit their needs because of their professional circumstances. More than 500,000 people have signed Ms. Dubé's petition, which members of this House received in 2016. Many families are joining together to offer support, hope and love to those who fall victim to an insidious disease that they did not choose. On behalf of all these people, we ask the government to open the door and support our motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051612">Madam Speaker, as we have been moving forward over the last number of years with changes and making our EI system that much better, ministries within the government have been working with different stakeholders. I referenced some of those earlier today, particularly in the health care area. The idea of 26 weeks or half a year was widely accepted. Increasing it from 15 weeks to 26 weeks or half a year would be a positive thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051613">Toward the end of her speech, the member talked about the importance of data, about the information that is there. Now that the Bloc understands that the government is moving forward, that we are going to look at increasing sick benefits to half a year, does that party recognize that some of the information that is being talked about today should go to committee where we could look at not only increasing sick benefits, but the wider picture that really needs to be addressed? </ParaText>

Whether it is a broken bone or cancer, they get 15 weeks, period. Something is obviously not right with this picture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051616">I will admit that the federal government made progress on EI during the last Parliament. I also recognize that EI was butchered in the past. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, the government did everything in its power to limit access to employment insurance. The previous government made progress, but much more needs to be done. If we start reviewing everything, we will still be here in 10 years. We know how these things go. I will not be here in 10 years, but others will be.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051619">I would like to ask her a question. Earlier, we saw that some of our colleagues, including the members for <Affiliation DbId="252701" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, seem to think a 50-week benefit period is too much and that a 26-week benefit period would suffice. The Bloc Québécois members believe that people who are ill should receive benefits for the entire duration of their illness, up to a maximum of 50 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051620">If our colleagues from Winnipeg North and Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier are giving up their constituents' benefits, could that money be used in other ridings so that people can receive benefits for a longer period?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051622">What needs to be highlighted is that members asked why we did not call for 60 or 70 weeks and whether we would be adding 20 weeks if it were 20 years from now. We need to be serious. A worker who loses their job is entitled to 50 weeks of benefits, whereas a worker who becomes ill is entitled to 15 weeks. That is the baseline amount, and that is what we are condemning. It is time for change. Since 1996, benefits have been capped at 15 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051623">Yes, some things have improved. However, with everything that is happening in terms of pollution and climate change, some things are getting worse. As I stated in my speech, my mother died more than 20 years ago. At the time, one in 10 people got cancer. Today, it is one in two. In my opinion, what people eat, drink and breathe must have something to do with it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6051624">Madam Speaker, to begin with, I would like to reassure the people of my riding. They are not just concerned about employment insurance sickness benefits. They are also concerned about the infamous spring gap that many of them will have to deal with in March. I want to reassure my constituents that I will listen to them and will continue to work hard so that the special EI needs of people in the regions are heard. I will not give up. That is for sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051625">In my riding, as in many other ridings in Quebec, employment insurance is key to worker retention, as I was explaining to our colleagues. We cannot claim to be calling for such action without promising the workers in question that they will benefit from EI measures that are fair and adapted to both a temporary lack of work and certain health realities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051626">Obviously, the Bloc Québécois wants to have more autonomy over employment insurance so that we can better adapt it to the reality in Quebec, both its urban centres and its regions. For example, we would like to establish a seasonal worker status. What is more, we would like to implement an insurance process that would give workers who are seriously ill access to income protection insurance that is flexible, appropriate and fair and that would allow them to extend the benefit period based on their health and their doctor's evaluation. Of course, we are not at that point, because we do not have sovereignty over employment insurance, but that is one of our objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051627">We all know that no one wants to be seriously ill. I am choosing my words carefully here, but these situations are determined by fate, just like job losses due to a lack of work. Our request is very simple. We want people who are seriously ill to have comparable insurance to people who lose their jobs because of a lack of work. The cause is the same in both cases, namely fate, or a situation that is completely out of their control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051628">That term should be added to our considerations so that we can avoid all kinds of comments, analyses, studies and consultations that will just further delay the process for people who need help now, who need help tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051629">Let us think about that for a moment. How is it possible that a worker who voluntarily leaves their job to take care of a loved one with a serious illness will receive better EI benefits than the person who is actually ill? It is almost embarrassing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051630">Émilie Sansfaçon can currently only receive 15 weeks of EI sickness benefits for her serious illness, or only 26 weeks going forward. Her sister and her spouse are entitled to the same benefits, although they are not the ones who are sick. It is fundamentally illogical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051631">Today, I am calling on the House to apply logic. It is not easy to look Émilie in the eye and tell her that, under the law, she has only 15 weeks to recover, or 26 weeks at most, as the other side of the House is proposing. Émilie is fighting for her life, for her young children, and is struggling with difficult treatments all while fighting for what we are fighting for here today, when she should be dedicating all of her time to recovering. She has taken up this cause because she knows that she is not alone and that there will be others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051632">While we are debating this issue in the House, Émilie is looking at her calendar to determine when the easiest time will be between her chemotherapy treatments so she can organize another fundraiser to raise enough money to get her through the next month. This is what she is doing while we talk here and while some members push for more studies. Émilie is looking for a time in her calendar when she will not be too nauseated or too exhausted to organize a fundraiser so her friends can help her pay her bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051633">I challenge any member of the House to look her in the eye and tell her that we did nothing or that we did only part of what we should have done. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051634">That is not the issue. Today, we can work together to show the people of Quebec and Canada that, when people are sick and lacking funds, we can come to a consensus that will serve the voters who elected us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051635">Who here can prove that 15 weeks at 50% of a person's salary is enough to cover their needs and the needs of their children, if applicable, for the duration of a treatment if that involves 26 biweekly chemotherapy treatments, as in Émilie's case?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051636">Math is not my strong suit, but, if my calculations are correct, that adds up to 52 weeks. For those who have suggested that 50 weeks is a random number, that is a concrete example of why it is realistic. It will take Émilie 52 weeks to get well. Would anyone in the House like to try showing me mathematically how Émilie can manage financially with 15 weeks or 26 weeks? If anyone can prove that to me, I urge them to rise now, and I will give them the floor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051637">We are elected legislators. We have the right and the duty to consider and implement fair and equitable laws without letting sentimentality or compassion impede our judgment. However, I sincerely believe that no one is indifferent when it comes to employment insurance for people who have a serious illness, such as cancer in particular. I have not seen anyone who is indifferent. We all know that we cannot put aside the fundamentally human aspect of this subject. So be it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051638">For once, let us add a little compassion to this exercise. Let us draw on our better selves and vote in favour of the Bloc Québécois motion that calls for fairness and justice for workers who meet all the insurability criteria and who are perfectly entitled to those benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051639">Let us not forget that the people who are currently sick and their employers paid into the employment insurance fund. It is their money. They participated in the collective contribution exercise so that anyone in need can get the appropriate employment insurance sickness benefits, that is to say, a minimum of 50 weeks of benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051640">Since taxpayers are the ones who contribute to the employment insurance fund, it is self-sustaining, particularly in a situation of almost full employment. This will have no real financial impact on the public purse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051641">Given that this request has been raised repeatedly in the past, that the Employment Insurance Act requires several adjustments adapted to today's realities, and that it has not changed in 40 years, I am appealing to the deep conscience of every member of the House to help Émilie Sansfaçon and Marie-Hélène Dubé, as well as every Michel, Yvon, Stéphane, Olivier, Julie, Violette, Fernand, Gérald, Pierrette, my uncle, my aunt, and my neighbour weather the storm of illness and hope for the peace of mind that will aid in their recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051642">All of this because we in the House had the wonderful idea of setting our differences aside and voting in favour of a motion that will enable them to live every moment, good or bad, in serenity, fairness and justice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051647">I agree with my colleague that concrete efforts have been made. These remarkable efforts have indeed helped change the situation for certain workers. I said “certain workers” because those changes do not help all workers. It is on a case-by-case basis. It can be said that some things have been done, and I am very pleased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051648">However, I want to reiterate something I said for my colleague's benefit. I suggest that he try getting 26 chemotherapy treatments, one treatment every two weeks, and see whether 50% of his salary is enough for a family with two children to live on for 26 weeks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051650">Madam Speaker, one of the areas I have tried to highlight is the importance of having factual information during this debate. The Bloc referenced the issue of seasonal workers and said that seasonal workers get 50 weeks of EI. That is not the case, and that is not the only issue in terms of factual information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051651">When I talk about that, I like to think it reinforces the need for us not to just say yes to the half-year but that maybe there is room for us to grow, and one of the ways we can do that is by talking about the facts in committee and looking at the data. Many Bloc members talked about the importance of the data. Would the member not agree that we should be looking at the issue in a standing committee also?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051652">Madam Speaker, many matters can be referred to committees, but they are not as urgent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051653">Seasonal workers were mentioned earlier. I have known seasonal work very well for the past 30 years. I can assure my colleague that there are eligibility criteria for employment insurance. When a seasonal or full-time worker meets the criteria for their region and unemployment rate, they are entitled to a full 50 weeks of benefits. Seasonal worker or not, if they have worked a certain number of hours over a certain period of time, they are entitled to 50 weeks of benefits. I promise you that is true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051654">Committees can look at the details. In my speech, I mentioned the spring gap and commended the steps that were undertaken with the pilot project. It had a positive impact in my region, and the gap was starting to close a little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051655">Another very interesting project is on the horizon. It encourages workers to specialize in their area of expertise or to explore a different field. Employers pay them and get reimbursed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051656">Those are projects that you brought forward. We applaud them, and we thank you for them. Nevertheless, many aspects of employment insurance can be improved. What we want to do today, as a matter of the utmost urgency, is to enable sick people to buy food and clothing and keep a decent roof over their heads. We are not asking for charity.

              <ParaText id="6051660">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and speak to the motion today before the House. I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252663" Type="2">Alfred-Pellan</Affiliation> and I certainly want to acknowledge the member opposite who brought forward this motion for debate. It is a very important motion. I would also like to acknowledge all of the members in this House who rose today to participate in debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051661">I first want to say that unemployment insurance benefits, or employment insurance, as we call it these days, is a critical program to workers all across Canada. Anyone who represents a rural riding in the north realizes how very critical that program is, not just for seasonal workers but for all people who need income during times of work loss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051662">This particular issue is one that hits at the heart and the home of many parliamentarians. All of us at some point in our careers have had to deal with families and family members going through sicknesses and illnesses who needed to take time off and take leave from their jobs to be able to care for themselves or someone they love.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051663">We also know that the employment insurance program in Canada is a last resort for many. We know that, and we have recognized it as a government. In the time we have been in office in this chamber as the Government of Canada, our party has introduced and made fundamental changes to the employment insurance program to be able to protect workers and their families. We know how important it is, and therefore we have been able to reflect upon their requests and their needs and what is in their best interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051664">We also know that many times workers cannot help the fact that they lose their jobs, get sick or have others around them who need their care. Therefore, having that support program is critical to them and the people they love.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051665">In the 2018 budget, we were able to ensure that not only did we have an EI program there for Canadians when they needed it, but we also extended the period that people could work while on a claim, which helped so many families in Canada. It allowed maternity and sick benefits so that mothers who were dealing with an illness or injury would have greater flexibility and could pace their return to work in a way that was better suited to them. The EI benefit program allowed them to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051666">We also introduced a new five-week employment insurance, a shared parental benefit, and I know many families in my riding who have used that benefit, along with families in ridings represented by others here. It gave both parents the opportunity to share some of that parental leave when they most needed to be with their young children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051667">We also know these proposed new benefits, which did not exist before, are going to provide for greater flexibility, especially to the moms, and allow them to have that ability to choose when they return to work and to be able to adapt to a schedule that met their family's needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051668">In 2017, we also introduced a new EI caregiving benefit. That benefit was well debated, not only in the House but also among our caucus and among Canadians. At the time, there was no benefit for those who had aging parents or family members who needed care, and they could not take leave to provide it. We made way for the 15 weeks, which allowed them temporary leave from their work to support a family member who was critically ill or injured.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051669">That program is working. We have had many conversations with Canadians about how we can provide more improvements in that program and be more accommodating to them. That is why we continue to consult: It is so that we can improve the programs and benefits we provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051670">We have also seen many parents of critically ill children who have been able to collect up to 35 weeks of benefits at a time when they needed it most in their lives. That program has been extended to very many Canadian families at a time when they were in dire straits and in a situation no family would want to be in.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051671">I know that our government also took many steps to improve the EI program as it related to seasonal workers. I hear my colleague talking about the black hole in the EI program. Those of us who represent seasonal industries and workers in seasonal industries know all too well what that means. We also know that there are ways to bridge that gap, and we can do it under certain reforms of this program. We announced a pilot project last year in certain regions of Canada. We have been testing how those benefits can best work, but we need to continue to provide those reliable supports for seasonal workers. In order to do that, we will continue to work with them and discuss with them ways we can improve the program. We will continue to collect the data we need to ensure that we are putting the right programs in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051672">I know that many health advocates out there, including the Canadian Cancer Society, have called for longer terms for EI sickness and EI benefits in order to better support those individuals and families who have longer recovery periods from illness. I am a cancer survivor. I went through surgery. I went through six months of chemotherapy. I went through radiation treatment. I was in a position where I did not have to turn to EI benefits, and I was very fortunate. That was because I had a job that allowed me to transition through that period in my life. However, it was also in that period in my life that I met many families that were having tremendous difficulty navigating through a serious illness, having to take leave from their jobs and the financial pressure that went along with it. It was during that time that I started to advocate for changes in the EI program. I am proud to say that today our government will move from 15 to 26 weeks to allow for extended benefits to families that need it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051673">I think what we have here today is a recognition, both by the Bloc and by our government, of that need existing out there, and a recognition that families are looking to us for that support, that compassion and that endorsement at that particular time in their life. I think where we disagree is on the number of weeks that should be provided, whether it should be 26 weeks, 15 weeks, 20 weeks or 50 weeks, whatever the case may be. However, if we look at the analysis that was done by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, we are falling in line with their recommendation to extend benefits to 26 weeks for Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051674">One of the saddest situations I ran into at that particular time, and a situation that I continue to run into in my riding, is families with sick children. In my case, in the north where I live, these children have to be flown out for treatment, to go to hospitals and to have tests done. If they are diagnosed with a serious illness or a disease that requires several weeks of treatment, the parents are required to take leave from work and to live away from home, so financial stress comes into the equation, along with the stress of caring for their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051675">That is why we have recognized that situation. We have recognized it, and it is the reason we are allowing for the 26-week benefit period. It is so that families that are in that situation right now, going through those difficult times in their life, are able to have the support they need. We may disagree on whether it should be 26 weeks or longer or less, but one thing is certain: The data that we have been given indicate that where we are today, at 15 weeks, is not meeting the needs of those families. As a government, we have recognized that. We have been very compassionate in the work that we have done. Our hearts break for those families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051676">We know that we need to step up and do more, and that is why we are stepping up to do more. I firmly believe that by taking these extra steps today, we will help many Canadian families to be able to take leave from their jobs and get EI benefits for up to 26 weeks while they go through treatment and care for sickness and illness. I also believe that as a government, we have a responsibility to continue to listen to Canadians, continue to review the programs and policies we have, listen to our colleagues in the House and the debates that they have, and hopefully at some point continue to make those programs better for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051678">What is the financial impact of a change from 26 weeks to 50 weeks compared to the economic benefits when these people return to work?

I have not seen any data that reflect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051681">What I have seen is what is reflected in the 26 weeks, what it will cost the government to provide that service and how many Canadians will be able to avail themselves of it, based on previous data and numbers. We feel that we need to make the move to 26 weeks of EI benefits for individuals who are sick and need to collect EI. Fifteen weeks is not enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051682">We know that increasing it to 26 weeks will provide benefits to many Canadians who are dealing with health care needs in hospitals and at home and will allow them to have financial security to a certain degree while they recover. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051689">Madam Speaker, today I am rising to speak to an issue that is important to me, one that affects many Canadians and is a principal part of Canada's social safety net. I am talking about employment insurance and the special benefits for workers who have to take leave for specific events, such as an illness, a pregnancy, caring for a newborn, helping a seriously ill or injured individual, or providing end-of-life care to a family member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051690">Founded on compassion and fairness, this system reflects an important part of the Canadian identity, which is steeped in sharing and helping one another. The principles governing this system tie in perfectly with the values of our government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051691">Many Canadians across the country struggle with illness. For some, the illness lasts a week or two, but for others, it lasts several weeks and, in some cases, for months or even years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051692">In many cases, the sick person has to take time off work to undergo suitable treatment. In some cases, it goes even further, and the person ends up unable to work. This leads to a marked decline in income or even the loss of that income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051693">To remedy this situation, the employment insurance program guarantees the payment of a maximum of 15 weeks of sickness benefits to people who are unable to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051694">We certainly recognize that although EI sickness benefits protect a large number of Canadians, some recipients exhaust their benefits before returning to work. I went through this myself exactly seven years ago, so I understand very well how difficult and distressing this situation can be. That is precisely why I am very proud of our government's commitment to making changes to this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051695">When we are ill or injured, the last thing we want to worry about is how we will put food on the table if we cannot go to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051696">Rest assured that our government is determined to improve the EI program to make it more flexible, more inclusive and easier to access. In fact, we supported Motion No. 201 concerning employment insurance sickness benefits. The motion called on the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development, and the Status of Persons with Disabilities to study this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051697">As part of this study, the committee examined the possibility of increasing the maximum number of weeks of employment insurance sickness benefits in order to support people suffering from long-term illnesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051698">Our government went further than this motion called for and proposed increasing EI sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 26 weeks to better support workers who need more time to recover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051699">This commitment is consistent with our hard work over the past four years to modernize the employment insurance system and take concrete steps to improve it for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051700">The Government of Canada has long recognized that Canadians who cannot work because of illness, injury or other family responsibilities face certain challenges.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051701">In budget 2017, the Government of Canada announced support for parents and caregivers by providing benefits that would be more flexible, more inclusive, easier to access and more responsive to their unique family and work circumstances. These changes to maternity, parental and caregiver benefits came into effect on December 3, 2017. We are proud that these changes are helping Canadians, but there is always room for improvement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051702">In budget 2018, our government announced that the provisions of the working while on claim pilot project would be extended to EI maternity and sickness benefits. This measure was implemented to ensure that Canadians who want to return to work after an illness or the birth of a child can do so without jeopardizing their EI benefits. These changes came into effect in August 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051703">Our government recognizes that there is still work to be done to protect the most vulnerable Canadians. Health problems are stressful enough without the added burden of unnecessary financial hardship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051704">It is our responsibility as a government to ensure that Canadians receive the support they need when they are recovering from an illness or injury. We owe it to Canadians who have to take time off work for illness, injury or quarantine reasons to extend the EI sickness benefit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051705">Let me be clear. The government is determined to improve the EI system. We want to adapt it to better reflect Canadians' reality. In fact, our government has made changes to give Canadians the support they need when they are sick, injured or quarantined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051706">I would also like to note that there are other measures besides EI to help Canadians grappling with a chronic or long-term illness. They include disability benefits under the Canada pension plan, the benefits offered by private insurance and paid by the employer, as well as the help provided by the provinces and territories.</ParaText>

It was interesting to hear the perspective of the Conservatives, which seemed to be more staying the course at 15 weeks, but encouraging that it be studied. The Bloc and the NDP seemed to be saying yes to the 50 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051709">It is important for us to recognize that for many years there was absolutely no change. For the first time, we are seeing a significant commitment to make the change from 15 weeks to half a year. I believe that demonstrates a great deal of goodwill. We have stakeholders who have been asking for 26 weeks, including the Canadian Cancer Society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051710">I wonder if my colleague could provide his thoughts on how important it is that, after many years, we finally have a government that is advancing. This is not the first time we have made changes to the EI program. Virtually from year two, we have seen some significant changes since we became government back in 2015.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051712">He is quite right. Our government is keeping the promise it made to Canadian workers and is committed to expanding EI sickness benefits by increasing them from 15 weeks to 26 weeks. This commitment builds on our hard work over the past four years. During that time, we modernized employment insurance and took concrete steps to improve this program for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051713">I will talk about some of the changes that we have made since 2015. We reduced the waiting period from two weeks to one. We introduced a new benefit for caregivers. We made the working while on claim provisions permanent and expanded them to include people receiving maternity and sickness benefits. We created new EI provisions for workers in seasonal industries, and so forth. Yes, much has been done. There is certainly much more to be done. We believe in realistic, achievable measures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051717">One thing that has not changed since the Liberals came to power is the access rate to the existing system.

              <ParaText id="6051727">The Bloc Québécois has always fought to improve employment insurance programs, and is still fighting to obtain better living conditions for workers in Quebec who actively contribute to the development of our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051728">It is in that context that the Bloc Québécois is calling for an improvement to the special employment insurance benefits for serious illnesses. This would help people who are coping with the vagaries of life to take care of themselves and recuperate in dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051729">Generally, the special employment insurance sickness benefits are adequate. However, in the case of a serious illness like cancer, depression or a stroke, 15 weeks of benefits are woefully inadequate to ensure a full physical and psychological recovery. When we think about it, it is absurd to expect to be fully healed in 15 weeks or even 26 weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051730">On top of being sick and temporarily unable to work, these individuals lose a lot. In addition to dealing with their inability to work and provide for their families, some people even lose their house, their car and other things because they have not yet recovered after the 15 weeks of special sickness benefits and they do not have access to any other financial assistance. Their life of hard work collapses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051731">These material losses add huge amounts of stress to people who are already seriously ill. This stress also affects the spouse, children and other family members. Remember that the very principle of EI is insurance paid for by workers to be able to deal with the vagaries of life. It is inconceivable that these benefits should be limited to 15 or 26 weeks as the Liberal Party is proposing. I would remind the House that it is a ceiling, not a goal to reach the maximum number of weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051732">What am I supposed to tell seriously ill people who reach out to me and ask me to help them? How can I explain to them that there are huge surpluses in the fund, but they still have to fight to make ends meet? They risk losing everything, while billions of dollars that come straight from their contributions and those of their fellow citizens remain in the coffers. What am I supposed to tell them when I know very well that the EI program could easily meet their needs? It is unacceptable and it is not humane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051733">I am feeling a little anxious now because I am running out of time. I cannot imagine how someone must feel when they have received 14 weeks of benefits but know they still need several treatments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051736">Madam Speaker, the stress and inconveniences also affect the employer and the work teams. When an employee does not perform as expected, that inevitably has a significant impact on the business that can even compromise the very future of the firm or at least its productivity. Sometimes the employer will end up terminating the employee who has not fully recovered. That is never a pleasant situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051737">By sticking with 15 weeks of special employment insurance sickness benefits, the government is forcing a physician, employer or citizen to not play by the established rules. They will do so out of compassion and common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051738">I will also take this opportunity to add that we should consider a similar change in family caregiver benefits. These should also increase to 50 weeks when required by the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051739">The entire employment insurance program must be overhauled to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden. I would remind members that the EI fund belongs to the workers and not to the Government of Canada. When we are sick, we should spend our time and effort on taking care of ourselves, not fighting to get something that belongs to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051740">My conclusion is very simple. We must amend the Employment Insurance Act to increase the maximum sickness benefit from 15 weeks to 50 weeks. Why not take this opportunity to also reduce the regulatory and administrative burdens? The goal is to adapt the employment insurance program to the current reality of workers in Canada and Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051756">The riding I represent, Skeena—Bulkley Valley, has been living this issue for years now. It is a difficult one for many people and for no people more so than the Wet'suwet'en. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051757">I asked Sue Alfred if I could share her story and she gave me her permission. Sue carries the hereditary Wet'suwet'en name Wil'at. She is 80 years old and she lives in the community of Witset just west of Smithers. Peter Michell and Annie Tiljoe were her grandparents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051758">In 1914, her mother was one year old and one of seven children. Her grandparents lived in a place called Misty Falls, near the community of Houston, where they had a homestead. They were living on land the Wet'suwet'en had occupied for millennia, and one day in 1914 the RCMP came to her property with the Indian agent and told her grandparents that they had to move along. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051759">They packed their things and walked dozens of miles to an area near Smithers called Glentanna. They tried to establish a home there. What happened? The same people showed up. The RCMP and the Indian agent came and again told them that they had to move along, and so they did. They moved to another place on the Telkwa High Road near the community of Witset and made their home there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051760">Sue tells me she remembers her grandmother crying as she told her this story of displacement. We can understand why the police action we have seen in recent days and weeks on Wet'suwet'en territory is so troubling to so many people who call that place home. This is why further police action threatens to undermine any chance of real reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051761">In the northwest we have been having the difficult conversations around reconciliation, resource development and respect for indigenous rights for years. As communities, we have started to face the difficult colonial history that has held back our relationship with indigenous people. We have begun to work on how to work together to be better stewards of the lands and waters and create a future for our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051762">In my hometown of Smithers we sat down with the Wet'suwet'en chiefs and elders and they told us their stories. We worked with them, the municipal government and the hereditary government, to tell the difficult stories about our community's past. It is one of the first steps in moving forward together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051763">Across the region I represent courageous indigenous people have been working for years to gain recognition and respect on their own lands. Some, like the Nisga'a people, succeeded in achieving British Columbia's first modern treaty, a treaty that set out a path for self-government and was signed in 1998.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051764">At the same time, it was the hereditary leaders of the Gitxsan and the Wet'suwet'en who went to court to establish and affirm their rights, to have them affirmed by the court, in the Delgamuukw-Gisday'wa court case. They fought for 20 years against the Crown, which for all that time maintained a policy of denial. It denied them their rights and denied them their stories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051765">They fought it all the way to the Supreme Court where on appeal their rights were affirmed and the judge said that their stories did matter and that they did have rights on that land. The Supreme Court ruled that their title to the land in northwest British Columbia that they have occupied for thousands of years remains unextinguished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051766">We have landed at a place where the only way out of this crisis is through dialogue, understanding, humility and true nation-to-nation talks. I am very pleased to see that those talks are starting. No matter how late in the game they are coming, they are of the utmost importance.

The Wet'suwet'en heredity chiefs are the same group that fought that Delgamuukw court case all the way to the Supreme Court. They fought against the government policy of denial and established a precedent for indigenous groups across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051768">The court recognized their standing and it set a precedent. In that ruling the judge directed the federal government that it had “a moral, if not legal, duty to enter into and conduct those negotiations in good faith” on the question of their indigenous title.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051769">In over 20 years since that historic ruling, successive Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to step up and begin the difficult work of upholding, acknowledging and affirming Wet'suwet'en title. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051771">The assertions made today by the leader of the official opposition suggesting that the Coastal GasLink project has majority support by one group or another group very much fall into this category. The reality is that the heredity chiefs represent a legitimate decision-making body for indigenous people outside of reserves. The court has said so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051772">I was at the balhats, the feast in Witset, where the chiefs ratified their non-consent for this pipeline. This came after they had recommended and suggested alternate routes, which were rejected by the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051773">Throughout all of this, where was the federal government? Where was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his commitment to reconciliation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051774">The reality is that we talk about changing our relationship with indigenous people, yet we see a reluctance to change anything about the status quo and the way we do business. As the blockades have shown, that is just not going to fly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051775">We have landed in a predicament that cannot be fixed by police action. If it could have, it would have been fixed in January 2019 when the police arrested and removed 14 people from the Morice West Forest Service Road, or it would have been fixed last month when they did the same thing again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051776">The images of RCMP tactical teams pointing rifles at unarmed Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan people, the images of indigenous people being dragged over the very land their ancestors once walked, and the vicious racist social media commentary we have seen online in recent days and weeks have sparked a solidarity movement the likes of which our country has never seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051777">We find ourselves where we are today with people across the country blocking the infrastructure that Canadians need in their daily lives for the services they rely on and the products their lifestyle relies on. We can discount the voices of the people blockading as those of fringe radicals or anarchists. We can choose to discount those voices, or we can listen closely to what indigenous people on those blockades are saying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051778">If we listen closely we can hear there is too much of a gap between what the government says about indigenous people and its actions. Do we actually grasp the gravity of a situation in which young indigenous people are telling us that reconciliation is dead? I am not sure we do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051779">As I said before, this issue is a very difficult one for northwest B.C. communities. There are indeed indigenous groups in the riding I represent that support this project and that stand to benefit from it. I spoke today with Crystal Smith, the chief councillor of the Haisla Nation. She told me about the educational and employment opportunities that people in her community are already experiencing. These voices are important too. We cannot ignore these voices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051780">Ultimately, the only way out of this is through nation-to-nation talks, dialogue and humility. The problem is that the government keeps talking about doing things differently without being willing to change the status quo one iota.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6051800">Madam Speaker, I want to reiterate the words of our leader from earlier today. He expressed how inspired we all are by the young people across this country who are rising and the people from all walks of life who are standing in support of human rights and climate justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051801">I also want to acknowledge the uncertainty of the times we are facing across the country. People are worried about getting to work. VIA and CN workers are worried about their jobs. People are worried about getting the supplies and products they need to keep themselves safe. Our thoughts are with those workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051802">My thoughts are also with those who are standing on the front lines of the blockade, where I, myself, as an indigenous person, have had to go to fight for my own basic human rights in this country. I understand the reasons for this. These people are defending what they know to be right. They are standing up, saying clearly that they support human rights for all people. They are hoping that this time, maybe this time, things might actually change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051803">It is a terrible crisis we are facing, but it is a repetitive crisis. Even though the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> callously indicated that it is a crisis of infrastructure disruptions, it is not. It is a human rights crisis that is rooted in the wrongful dispossession of lands from indigenous people. It is a crisis being faced by people right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051804">Canadians are now looking for leadership from all of us, and they are looking for leadership from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. So far what we have seen from the Prime Minister and the government is a huge gap between what has been promised and what has been delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051805">This crisis did not start overnight. It is rooted in the wrongful dispossession of lands from indigenous peoples and the human rights violations and violent colonialism that have become so normalized that indigenous people are not afforded the minimum human rights standard that any person needs, indigenous or not, to live a life of joy. This minimum human rights standard is contained in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights laws and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, declarations and laws Canada has agreed to follow but often fails to do so in practice. It is a continuation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051806">These human rights violations have impacted my own family and nation. Residential schools, the sixties scoop and the dispossession of our lands have left a lasting impact on our community that continues to impact us even today. Residential schools disrupted our families. They were about the forced incarceration of children for no other reason than their ancestry, an ancestry of great leaders who taught the values of respect, love, courage, humility, truth, wisdom and kindness, the seven sacred laws that guided a beautiful way of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051807">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to do things differently. He made commitments to working toward a path to support reconciliation. Once again indigenous people throughout this country are left disappointed. Once again they have been afforded nothing but broken promises that have resulted in many indigenous people throughout this country being homeless on their own lands.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051808">There have been generations of promising one thing but doing another. Instead of learning lessons from the past, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has doubled down. He promised to be different. He promised to make change. He promised to take the genuine steps toward reconciliation. He has a list of things he has done, but let us look at what he and his government have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051809">He broke those promises. They have ignored the courts, ignored this place and ignored their own promises. They have continued to drag first nations kids to court who are fighting for their right to have equal access to programs and services and to have the same human rights as other children who live on the lands that we now call Canada. They have broken their commitment to close the funding gap for kids living on reserve to go to school, and they have underfunded the programs set up to help women reclaim their status and those seeking compensation for day schools. Despite promise after promise, they have dragged their feet on meeting their obligations to ensure that clean drinking water is available in indigenous people's communities across the country. These are basic human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051810">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done all of this while undermining and laughing at indigenous people, including Young Water and Land Protector from Grassy Narrows, who attended a fundraising event and raised the issue of clean drinking water. This is not a joke. We are not a joke. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051811">I have fasted on those blockade lines at Grassy Narrows, the beautiful lands that have been impacted by development. Once again Grassy Narrows is being denied the human right to a healthy environment, and the government is taking its sweet time in providing a treatment centre for those suffering from mercury poisoning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051812">In the House, weeks ago, when the NDP called on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to accept an invitation from the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> laughed and said that it was not his problem and that it was “entirely under provincial jurisdiction.” I can say one thing. I am glad that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not calling on the police to be sent in. We have seen the consequences of that before. However, how, just a couple of weeks ago, could he have been so blind to the reality on the ground, ignoring the voices of indigenous people, of young people across this country? Just a couple of weeks ago, how could have been so blind? It says so much about why and how we got to where we are right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051813">There is a fundamental misunderstanding, willful or not, about the facts of the situation we are currently faced with. Most Canadians have learned a history that ignores the real history of the violent colonialism upon which this place was built that continues under our very own watch today. The concept of the rule of law has been used in this country to steal children away from their families. We cannot pick and choose to only use the rule of law when it suits our economic interests. We must enforce the rule of law to ensure that all people in this country can be afforded human rights, including the rights that indigenous people have to their aboriginal rights and title.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051814">We have a path forward that was provided by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. However, it is one thing to enact it; we must also respect it. We must respect minimum human rights standards and use the rule of law not to punish but to ensure a good quality of life for all peoples in this place we now call Canada.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, in this country there has been a history of that kind of violent, colonial, human rights-violating behaviour. </ParaText>

I did the infantry basic training and did okay, and that summer I was deployed to Valcartier, along with another group of people in my platoon, to work and dedicate that summer to serving in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051828"> Why I did so was multifold. I wanted people to be proud of me. I wanted to serve my country. I wanted to learn some discipline that is not natural to me; it comes with difficulty and I still have not gotten there, but my effort and my heart was in it. I wanted to learn discipline and do things that I could not do outside the classroom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051829">That summer was a difficult summer for Canada. There were in my platoon four Mohawk brothers in arms. As everyone knows, 30 years ago the Oka crisis exploded. There was one night in Valcartier as we were all out, that word came down that the Royal 22e Régiment would deploy and put under siege their community. The next morning, they were no longer there. They were asked to make a difficult choice, choosing between the country that they would lay down their life for and their families. For them, the choice was clear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051830">It was a privilege for me not to have to make that choice myself. I have not thought about that day much, for a long time. However, we all know or should know what happened at Oka. We should know that no individuals should have to choose between their families, their nation and the country that they would readily lay their lives down for. We vowed that this would never happen again, and it should not happen again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051831">When we called on indigenous people in our hardest times, they served us. They defended us. They form statistically the highest percentage of people who serve in our armed forces. We should never forget that this relationship, for many communities, is based on alliance and loyalty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051832">I know that the recent events in B.C. and in various places across the country are deeply concerning to all Canadians. It is a very difficult situation for everyone, for those people who are non-indigenous but especially if they are indigenous. All of Canada is hurting and we are all hoping and working for a peaceful resolution. This is a challenging situation that is evolving by the hour, and the safety of all involved is of primary importance. We all want to get the same conclusion. There are some disagreements, some deep ones, as to the steps. We all want peace, we want to get rail traffic going again across this country and we want prosperity for all peoples of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051833">There is time for all parties to engage in open and respectful dialogue to ensure this situation is resolved peacefully. To that end, I want to acknowledge the leaders of the NDP, the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party for their support and partnership in seeking a peaceful resolution. This work is not easy and it will require all of us working together in the immediate future and in the long term. We cannot move forward without honest and respectful dialogue, and that is why I am happy to take the opportunity to share my thoughts this evening and to take questions from members of this House.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051834">Seeking an honest, open and respectful dialogue is essential for renewing the relationship and building a strong future for indigenous peoples and Canadians alike. The untold story that should be told today is that despite years of tarnished relationships, we all want to see peace and our relationship renewed, and to have a relationship based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051835">It is in this spirit of peace and co-operation that I went this past Saturday and gathered with members of the Mohawk nation along the rail tracks in Tyendinaga to discuss peace and friendship with a nation that has not felt part of this country. We pursued an open dialogue and made concerted efforts to move toward a peaceful resolution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051836">Modest but important progress was made through this dialogue. Parts of this conversation were very difficult, very painful and very personal. Upsetting stories were shared about this country's troubling treatment of indigenous peoples. There was an immense amount of suspicion toward my presence; fear that it was a ruse and that the police would move in. It is not every day that people are surrounded by police, and the reactions are normal. They are a peaceful people, and they reiterated it time and time again. We shared laughs, and as tradition dictates, we had a meal before the discussion. We listened to one another with openness and with a shared goal of finding a path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051837">I made a commitment to share our conversation with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and my colleagues, and I did so that night. Yesterday we had a more extensive conversation at a meeting of the incident response group, which was convened by the Prime Minister in response to the urgent and considerable need to further open the dialogue and continue the dialogue we started in Tyendinaga on Saturday morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051838">My colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation>, also remains in communication with the Province of B.C. and hereditary leadership, with the hopes of meeting in person soon. She also had a very productive conversation with the leadership to open up that path to de-escalation. It will not be an easy one. There are many demands, many historical grievances, but there is a clear sense that there is a protocol to be observed and a pathway toward de-escalation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051839">We are a country built on the values of peace, order and good government. We hear it all the time. We need to make sure we remain focused on those ideals. One of the steps necessary to achieve peaceful progress in an unreconciled country is to continue that open dialogue at the very highest levels of government based on a nation-to-nation and government-to-government relationship, and that is exactly what has guided and underlined our actions over the past few days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051840">Unfortunately, in the case of indigenous peoples, we have too often discarded the first pillar, which is peace, for the sake of order and good government. I am someone who spent a long time in private practice. I have two law degrees and am accredited to practise in two jurisdictions. Let me say that the rule of law is very dear to me. I have spent my life and career upholding it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051841">I hear from the indigenous communities I serve, to which I have a fiduciary obligation that goes back before Canada to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, to uphold the honour of the Crown. Those people say too me too often that rule of law has been invoked to perpetrate historical injustices. We need only look at the examples of Louis Riel, Big Bear and Poundmaker to have some of the more poignant examples, as well as those perpetrated on a daily basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051842">People have said to lock them up. Guess what, that has been tried. The level of incarceration is six times higher for the indigenous population of Canada, and in some provinces, much worse. These are very serious issues that demand our attention and have demanded it for hundreds of years, and there is no place in this discussion for rhetoric and vitriol. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051843">The question I find myself asking time and time again as I look at my children is whether we are going to do things the way we have always done them, which has brought us to this point in our relationship, or whether we are going to take a new approach that prioritizes open dialogue built on respect, one that engages us in a true government-to-government relationship. The conversations we started on Saturday, and those my colleagues have offered to have across the country at the highest level, will help us find a more collaborative and therefore constructive way forward. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="40">(1940)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051844">It is only through meaningful engagement with those who have felt ignored and disrespected for too long that we can find a way forward that builds peace and prosperity for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051845">For almost 500 years, indigenous peoples have faced discrimination in every aspect of their lives. The Crown, at times, has prevented a true equal partnership from developing with indigenous peoples imposing, instead, a relationship based on colonial, paternalistic ways of thinking and doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051846">As I mentioned in introduction, many of our relationships were based on military alliances to ensure our own sovereignty. Let me say, they stepped up when we needed them. A little over a year ago, this whole House rose to celebrate Levi Oakes and the untold story of the last Mohawk code talker. Sadly, a few months later after this lifting up that was long overdue, he passed away. He was born in Snye, Akwesasne, part of Quebec. He served in the U.S. armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051847">A story that has not been told is why he did not serve Canada. He did not serve Canada because his brother was beaten up by a policeman, and he vowed never to serve in our forces. We need to think about that, when we think about the people who serve us best. Those who came back from having served overseas, arm in arm, brothers in arms, sisters in arms were not treated that way. They were discriminated against. They could not get their pensions or medical benefits. The list is long and it is painful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051848">Here we are today. It has been mentioned by members of the opposition and it needs to keep being mentioned that we face a historic challenge, an injustice that we keep perpetrating towards the most important things in our life, children, in this case, for indigenous peoples, their children. There is a broken child and family system where indigenous children up to the age of 14 make up 52% of kids in foster care and care, even though they represent 7.7% of all Canadian children. There are shocking rates of suicide among indigenous youth causing untold pain and hurt that will plague families and communities for generations to come. There are untenable housing conditions, where water that is unsafe to drink or even bathe in comes out of the taps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051849">In Lac Seul where we lifted a boil water advisory for the first time in 17 years, the kids in the room had never had clean water from their system. One of the elders I spoke to giggled with a sense of humour that we see in, and is almost unique to, indigenous communities. She said to me that now it would not itch after she took her bath.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051850">There are communities where overcrowding and mould are far too common. There are communities that do not have reliable access to roads or health centres or even schools. That approach has left a legacy of devastation, pain and suffering, and it is unacceptable and untenable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051851">For hundreds of years indigenous peoples have been calling on the Canadian government to recognize and affirm their jurisdiction over their affairs, to have control and agency over their land, housing, education, governance systems, and child and family services. We have undeniable proof that self-determination is a better path to take. For example, look at the Mi’kmaq communities in Nova Scotia. In 1997, the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia signed a historic agreement with nine Mi'kmaq communities, restoring their control over their education system. The result is that now more than 90% of Mi’kmaq students graduate. It is higher than the average in most provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051852">That is what comes when Canada steps out of the way and accepts the necessity of self-governance and self-determination. This is what has to happen in every sector. This is what communities are asking for now, and have been asking for far too long. It is what is at stake when we speak about self-determination. Self-governing indigenous peoples have better socio-economic outcomes because they know best what to do with their resources. More children finish high school. Fewer people are unemployed. Health outcomes are better. Self-determination improves the well-being and prosperity of indigenous communities, and that is something all Canadians should strive to support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051853">When we formed government, we took a different approach founded on partnership and co-development, built from a place of listening to indigenous leaders, elders, youth and community, working with members, and working to support the attainment of their goals based on their priorities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6051854">It is important to highlight this while the events gripping the nation are on the front page of the newspapers. The progress, while slow, has been determined, forceful and backed up with historic amounts. Since 2016 we have invested $21 billion into the priorities of indigenous partners, and together we have made some progress. Sixty-nine schools were built or renovated. Some 265 water and wastewater infrastructure projects were completed and 88 long-term drinking water advisories were lifted. We are contributing toward the establishment of a wellness centre in Nunavut in partnership with the Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated. We are supporting the national Inuit suicide prevention strategy and ensuring that Inuit children have access to the health, social and educational supports they need. We are working with the Métis nation to advance shared priorities such as health, post-secondary education and economic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051855">However, we still have a long way to go to close the unacceptable socio-economic gaps that still exist between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. Our government is committed to working in partnership on improving the lives of first nations children, and our track record of the past four years shows this. We have almost doubled funding to first nations child and family services agencies, from close to $677 million in 2016 to $1.2 billion in 2018-19. That funding is based on actual needs and with an emphasis on prevention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051856">There have been 508,000 requests for Jordan's principle approved, which ensures first nations children have the health, education and social supports they need, when and where they need them. I was in Whitefish River First Nation about three days ago, and I saw the work that Jordan's principle does for children who need it, and we are striving to ensure they get substantive equality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051857">We are providing predictable funding to education that is provincially comparable. We know this is essential to strengthen first nations education and improve outcomes, because indigenous peoples must have control over first nations education systems. We know when that is done indigenous graduation rates are the same, if not better, than non-indigenous graduation rates. We have launched a new funding formula for kindergarten to grade 12 education that has resulted in regional funding increases of almost 40%. The number of first nations schools offering elementary full-day kindergarten, for example, has increased by over 50%.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6051858">We have a tough road ahead of us. As I mentioned, this road will be demanding on all of us. We will have to work together very hard and listen even when the truth is hard to hear. We will have to continue discussions even when we do not agree. We will have to keep working together, looking for creative ways to move forward and finding new paths towards healing and true understanding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051859">We have all seen what happens when we do not work together and engage in dialogue. We end up with mistrust and confusion over who should speak on behalf of rights holders on issues like consent, as well as the rights and titles of indigenous peoples. This confusion can lead to conflict, as we are seeing now, and prevents us from moving forward together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051860">I realize that the challenges we face are many, but I know that the difficult road ahead of us is worthwhile. It is worthwhile for the youth in the next generation and for those who will follow. It is worthwhile for all those who will grow up knowing that together, the Crown and indigenous peoples are working hard to create a future, to improve their quality of life and to heal. We will not fail another generation of indigenous children.</ParaText>

We have a lot more to do, and we cannot discount mistakes, but we do it in good faith and in good partnership with indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051862">I ask everyone in this House as they contemplate the next few days to look at their children or those that are young and are dear to them and ask themselves what they will tell them when this conflict resolves.

              <ParaText id="6051865">The comments and question I have are linked to what the minister was talking about in his speech. He referenced the issues that first nations communities are having in their jurisdictions, and I think we all need to continue to hear about those issues. One way to improve the conditions in these first nations communities is with economic opportunities and prosperity. That is one way which Coastal GasLink was going to do for the 20 first nations communities that signed on to this project. It was going to provide their members jobs, opportunity and hope, which is a good thing and what we want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051866">The minister talked a lot about the group that is against the project, but what he did not mention was the 85% plus who voted in favour of the project, such as the elected chief, the elected council and the hereditary chiefs who all supported this project. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051868">Madam Speaker, too often in this country we have taken the approach that we would pick whatever indigenous view suits our thoughts and our process. That is not self-determination. That is not respect. We need to understand the decisions that are made by communities and not take a simplistic view as to what is or what is not, or presume the outcome in an indigenous community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051869">There is no question that the Coastal GasLink project was widely consulted. A process was undertaken by Coastal GasLink and respected, but we cannot then turn around and presume that there is no complexity in community, that there is no complexity in decision-making, that there is not a challenge towards elected leadership and community, or that there is not a tension between hereditary and elected leadership. That is not the same for every community, and I think we need to open our minds to what the differences are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051870">The challenge we face today is that before us we have a number of people who are fighting for their rights, and they are looking for a peaceful solution. We need to work with those people and start to listen to them in a way that we have not listened before, and that is what I am asking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051871">There is no question that communities want economic development. I met last week with people from the Treaty 8 first nations, and they have great projects that they are working on. They want economic development; there is absolutely no question about it. However, we cannot simply say that because that particular point of view suits our political end we are going to take that indigenous community and serve our purpose. We need to respect decisions when they are good and we need to respect decisions when they are bad. Moreover, we need to sit down and listen, and come to a co-operative model of how we move together as a country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051885">Clearly, I was nervous. A lot of people told me not to go, not to listen and to leave it to the officials, but when you begin a process of trust with a group where trust is absent, it is very difficult to make that approach. People feel vulnerable. That said, I had the trust of some people I knew in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051886">The untold story in this whole situation is that this was only possible with the help of many of the women in the community. They facilitated these conversations. There was mistrust and they did not want me to come. They thought it was a ruse. I did not understand it at all, but as I talked with them throughout the day, I could see that they had every reason to be suspicious. There is quite a history to consider. They had felt cheated and tricked by the police, and they saw history repeating itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051887">It is hard to build trust behind a blockade, so we absolutely needed to go there and start talking. I described the progress as “modest” overall, but we built some trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051888">I have confidence. What we tried to find is a path to de-escalation. I remain confident and hopeful that this will happen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051900">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise and address the House on this important emergency debate this evening. The situation surrounding the Wet'suwet'en blockades has spiralled out of control. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051901">The Liberal government has demonstrated, through its inaction on this issue and its refusal to meet with the Wet'suwet'en people on the opening days of this crisis, that the pursuit of the UN Security Council seat is more important than the safety of Canadians. Its procrastination has caused this crisis to inflame and spread across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051902">Just today, a group of radicals went to the house of B.C. Premier Horgan with the intent of placing him under citizen's arrest. The premier of a province in this great country is having radicals approach his house. That is absolutely wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051903">These small groups of protesters continue their illegal blockades at railway and border crossings around the country. As I have said before, many of these protesters have no connection to this country. They have their agenda and they want to enforce it, even if the people they pretend to advocate for do not want it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051904">Wet'suwet'en people have highlighted in the media how many of these protesters are not from the region or the community or, as I said, even our country. Siding with a small group of activists because they happen to align with one's views, and insisting that the RCMP enforce these views against the will of the majority of the Wet'suwet'en people, contradicts the spirit of reconciliation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051905">Hereditary chief Helen Michelle of Skin Tyee First Nation of the Wet'suwet'en has stated that “A lot of the protesters are not even Wet’suwet’en”. She said that the Wet'suwet'en talked to the elders and kept bringing them back, and they walked the territory where the Coastal GasLink is going. She added, “Our people said go ahead” to Coastal GasLink.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051906"> Hereditary Chief Theresa Tait-Day of Wet'suwet'en Nation said, “In the case of #CoastalGasLink, 85% of our people said yes they want this project.” </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051909"> The vast majority of members of the Wet'suwet'en people support the Coastal GasLink project. Every single band council on the Coastal GasLink route supports this project. Even the majority of hereditary chiefs support this project. The vast majority of first nations community members themselves support this project because of the massive benefits to their nation. A minority imposing its will on the majority is causing this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051910"> The democratically elected leadership of the Wet'suwet'en, who not only represent the people of the community but also the hereditary leaders, have signed off on this project. Why? It is because it is good for their community. It provides economic benefits, it will lift people out of poverty and it will provide the next generation of Wet'suwet'en with the resources to not only improve their own lives, but to build a strong, independent nation within Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051911">Before I continue, I would like to mention that I am splitting my time with my friend from Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051912">A B.C. judge issued an injunction saying protesters could not block Coastal GasLink from accessing the work site. Under Canada's Constitution, the duty to consult with impacted indigenous communities is clear and it has been upheld by numerous court decisions. One may not always agree with the decision, but one must respect it. That is the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051913">Canadian veterans, both non-indigenous and indigenous, fought for the rule of law, not tyranny. In fact, 200 indigenous Canadians died for Canada in military service, and they did not even have the right to vote. It is shameful that it was not until 1960 that they won that right. The rule of law, and freedoms of expression and peaceful protest are hard-fought rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051914">Many indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians peacefully protested for those rights, with some even taking their seats in this very place. Indigenous peoples have fought too long and too hard in this country to ensure that their views are heard. We need to honour that. It is not to diminish the spirit of those peaceful activists by allowing a small group of radicals to derail the reconciliation process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051915">While we might not always agree on the policy, we must always agree to sit down and talk. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> failed to do that, and we are now faced with the crisis before us. While the rule of law must be upheld, there must be a fair and transparent engagement process for any proposed natural resource projects in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051916">The National Energy Board concluded that the project is fully within the jurisdiction of the B.C. government, through which the proponents received approval to proceed after undergoing extensive regulatory and environmental reviews. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051917">The fact remains that consultations were conducted, and the majority of the Wet'suwet'en people support the project and believe it will benefit their community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051918">While we appreciate the right of individuals to protest peacefully, we urge all groups to do so in a safe and responsible manner. The <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">transport minister</Affiliation> confirmed that railway crossings have been tampered with, specifically the lights that indicate a train is coming. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051919">I am from a rural riding. Many children in countless rural communities across the country cross railway crossings to and from school every day. Putting the lives of these children at risk is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051920">The actions of these people are criminal, and Canadians expect the police to put an end to that. It has been 13 days. Just this weekend the government decided to sit down and meet with first nations leaders to open dialogue on this crisis, a crisis that could have been diverted if the government's talk on reconciliation was not just rhetoric.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051921">While this country was being held hostage by anti-energy activists, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> felt his time was better spent hugging the Iranian foreign affairs minister, whose country admitted to shooting down Flight 752, killing 63 Canadians. He felt his time was better spent schmoozing with dictators and human rights violators to woo them to get a vote for a frankly useless seat at the UN, rather than safeguarding Canadians and protecting the economy of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051922">Our veterans fought for our right to protest. It is enshrined in the highest law of our land. Everybody in this country, whether they live here or are from another country, has the right to freedom of speech and the freedom to protest, regardless of how much we agree or disagree. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051923">What they do not have the right to do is shut down our railways and ports. They do not have the right to block honest Canadians from getting to and from work. They do not have the right to block small businesses and farmers from getting their goods to market. They do not have the right to put the lives of Canadians at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051924">Let me be clear. Legitimate concerns are being expressed by people at these protests and by indigenous people. They need to be heard. There needs to be dialogue, and there needs to be reconciliation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051925">My role as shadow minister for Crown-indigenous relations is to work with my colleagues across the way and indigenous leaders from communities around the country to effect real and positive change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051926">However, we cannot allow a small group of radical protesters, who have no real vested interest in reconciliation and who the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has placed on the same tier as the countless men and women in first nations communities who have fought in good faith to right the wrongs of Canadian history, to do a disservice to the spirit of reconciliation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051927">Therefore, we have requested the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> do a number of things, including come up with a plan forward. We are still waiting for that. We heard words from the Prime Minister that were just words. There is still no plan. The situation has continued over a long period of time. The government acts surprised that we have come to this point, yet burying its head in the sand is exactly how we got to this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051928">We heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, who basically blamed anyone who had a differing opinion from him. That is not part of working together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051929"> I welcome questions from my colleagues across the way. Hopefully, we will find a peaceful solution to the situation.</ParaText>

I would also argue that the company representing this pipeline had talked about and consulted on this project for over five years. These conversations have gone on for quite some time. Eighty-five per cent of people within the Wet'suwet'en community support this project. The majority of hereditary chiefs support this project. The duly elected chief and council support this project. They see a path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051935">What Conservatives have pointed out many times, and which I did in my speech, is that there are activists who have an agenda that is totally separate from that of those first nations communities. These people want the end of oil and gas development in Canada. They want to shut down that vibrant economy of our country and are trying to glom on to this very important issue that five hereditary chiefs have with what is going on with this pipeline.</ParaText>

As my leader asked, will we let our economy be taken hostage by a small group that rejects the legal system that has been in place in our country for more than 150 years?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051950">The Prime Minister claims that he is sensitive, more than any other prime minister before him, to the concerns of the first nations. However, that cannot live up to the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051951">I have a few examples of comments made by first nations members. Today, the House wants to debate Canada's indigenous problem of the past 150 years when the main issue is dismantling the blockade as quickly as possible. The economy is at risk. We can understand that there are indigenous peoples in Canada who have differences that they want to resolve and that they are looking for solutions. We all agree on that. However, the first thing that must be done is to tell people that a few dozen individuals have completely shut down Canada's rail network. That is a critical piece of infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051952">When it comes to critical infrastructure, billions are being spent on national defence, and hundreds of millions are being spent on public safety to protect Canadian infrastructure. This includes cyber-attacks, coastal defence and aerospace. We can put in whatever we want. Right now, a few dozen individuals, including many activists who are not indigenous, by the way, are on the tracks in Canada and are blocking Canada’s entire railway system. Do we think that this make sense? Do we think that we should be spending the entire evening until midnight talking about indigenous issues?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051953">Could we talk about it tomorrow once we get the tracks cleared and the railway system up and running again? That is what is important. I do not understand how the coalition of the Bloc Québécois, the NDP and the Liberals could talk about indigenous issues in the broadest sense, while nothing is moving. We cannot wrap our heads around it. One day I would like to have a discussion with people from the other parties and have someone explain to businesses and the entire country how we can do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051954">Let us go back to what indigenous people have already said about the current problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051955">Chief Larry Nooski said that Coastal GasLink presents the Nadleh Whut'en First Nation with an unparalleled economic growth opportunity. They negotiated hard to ensure that the Nadleh people, including their young people, can benefit directly or indirectly from this project, while ensuring that the land and water will also be protected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051956"> Hereditary chief Helen Michelle of Skin Tyee First Nation of the Wet'suwet'en has stated that most of the protesters were not even Wet’suwet’en. She added that her people gave Coastal GasLink the go-ahead, that they talked and talked to the elders, and brought them back to walk the territory where the Coastal GasLink is going. They are going to give it the go-ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051957">Hereditary chief Theresa Tait-Day of the Wet'suwet'en nation said that 85% of her people said yes to Coastal GasLink.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051958">There is a very sensitive issue in Quebec, and I hope my Bloc friends are listening. Bill 21 is a very sensitive topic that most Quebeckers are unanimously in favour of. Some Quebeckers are against Bill 21. If those who oppose it decided to block the Louis-Hippolyte-Lafontaine bridge-tunnel and the Pierre-Laporte bridge in Quebec City because they are against Bill 21, would they be there for long? Would my Bloc colleagues be okay with them staying there and exercising their right to protest? No, they would have to leave before any discussion could happen. The same principle applies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051959">Is any particular cause more important than another? So important that it can be allowed to block the national economy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051960">If 85% of the community supports the project, that means 15% of the community does not. Should all our rail lines be blocked because 15% of the population does not agree? That makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051961">We must ask ourselves whether Canada can turn a blind eye to these illegal acts. We understand that they want to talk, but we need to intervene, particularly since everyone knows that the first nations in the region agreed to the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051962">In Ontario, Tyendinaga Mohawk police chief Jason Brant reminded protesters that their actions were illegal and that they should leave the premises peacefully. He read a letter to protesters asking them to go home and to tell the Ontario Provincial Police that they intended to do just that. The police peacefully reminded people that they were committing an offence. The police officers did their job. They told the protesters that they could not stay there. We wanted peaceful measures and that is what happened. The police have not been aggressive. They said that they had received a letter from the court and that the protesters had to leave. They were not mean about it. It is when people fail to listen to police instructions that the problems begin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051963">With regard to public safety, rail systems were tampered with and the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> is aware of that. When the blockades come down, the rail systems will have to be checked because it is dangerous for the trains. It is urgent that we put an end to the protests and get the rail system back up and running as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051964">The economic impact is huge, especially for passengers. Yes, passengers can take the bus or other forms of transportation. However, this also has an impact on the supply of products like propane and chlorine and on infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051965">It is not just about money. Some people will say that money is not important, since it grows on trees. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thinks. However, businesses do not survive on the government's money; they survive on their own money. If they suffer losses, no one will compensate them, but let us not talk about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051966">The municipalities need chlorine for water treatment. If there are chlorine shortages, this will become a public health issue. There are many problems like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051967">Yes, negotiations related to indigenous issues are important. We have indigenous affairs spokespersons to take care of that. However, what urgently matters today is clearing the rail line to get our economy back on track. Then we can begin the necessary discussions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6051989">I am not proud of this, but in some ways, the people of La Prairie were the pioneers of the sad situation were are currently experiencing. As of last Monday, over 3,000 people in my part of the country were denied access to public transportation because of a blockade set up by about a dozen individuals in Kahnawake. We are not sure of the exact number. We were therefore the first to suffer the consequences of the crisis and my riding was truly a microcosm of what is currently happening across Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051990">Since I am somewhat responsible for the well-being of my constituents, I tried to improve the situation and even solve the problem. One can always hope. I asked the question this morning and the discussion was going in that direction this afternoon: I looked for the government member responsible for taking care of the situation. I looked for the person responsible for resolving the crisis, but that was no easy feat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051991">I told myself that there must be a conflict since the band chief indicated that it was not the band council that told the protesters to set up the blockade but that he would not get the peacekeepers to intervene to prevent them from doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051992">That is when I understood that this was a communication problem, unless it was simply a problem between various indigenous people on the reserve. Then I thought it was a problem related to the management of relations with indigenous peoples, and since we have two ministers looking after the issue, I would have a good chance of getting one of them to help me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051993">I first tried to call the office of the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation>. I never heard back. It felt a little like calling a hospital, where no one answers. I left messages, but I never heard back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051994">Then, I thought I should try the second minister, and so I called the <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>. I was sure he would answer, but I was wrong. Later that day, after writing to him, we received an email informing us that it was the Minister of Transport who was looking after this file. That is when I started to worry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051995">We reached out to the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> who told us that CN had obtained an injunction against the protesters blocking its rail lines. Then, all communication stopped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051996">First of all, CP serves my riding; not CN. That information was not helpful. Second of all, not long after, I heard the minister on TV saying that it was not the federal government's problem, that it was a provincial problem and that it was up to them to maintain order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051997">I was very worried. When I see my Conservative colleagues shaking their fists and acting like G.I. Joe, I get worried. Why? I get worried because someone acted like G.I. Joe in my riding back in 1990 and it did not go well. Thirty years later we are still seeing the consequences. Scars have remained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051998">As a result, when I saw this situation taking place last week, I thought that we would have to negotiate; find someone who will negotiate. I see you looking at me, Madam Speaker, wondering who was the lucky elected official or leader who helped me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6051999">That is a good question, because neither of the two ministers helped me. I thought one of them might even be an urban legend. Surely she did not exist, since I never saw her anywhere and she never responded to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052000">I am a nice guy who likes good relations. The ministers responsible for indigenous affairs can see that the first problem to arise in Quebec was in Kahnawake. As a member of Parliament, I was expecting one of the ministers to ask in which riding this was taking place. It was all taking place in La Prairie. Perhaps I should give them a call, tell them not to panic, that we are there, and so on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052002">I find it problematic to see the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in Africa trying to get seats on the Security Council when security in his own country is not going well. It is also problematic when the <Affiliation DbId="253365" Type="4">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> is nowhere to be found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052003">Six days later, my constituents were forced to take a bus. I called the company Exo, which is really helping my constituents by providing them with bus transportation. The people at Exo told me that they were emergency measures. In other words, the service was limited, it would not last and we would no longer have the nice buses. Drivers from Abitibi and Trois-Rivières who came to help out would stop coming. The situation was dire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052004">Today, I realize that we have lost eight or nine days. The people in my riding are feeling the effects of eight days of this government's inaction. Nothing has happened. It has not even taken a step in the right direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052005">These people are suffering the consequences of the Prime Minister's inaction, empty words and lip service. In 2015, he was talking about reconciliation with the first nations people. Today, I heard him announce that there would be a ministerial statement. I thought we were going to learn something. No such luck. He read the text he read during the 2015 election. What kind of progress was achieved between 2015 and 2019? The answer to that is obvious to Dalida fans: “words, words, words”. He did not make any progress. Nothing happened. This crisis was wholly concocted. Later, in 10, 15, 20 or 30 years, when crisis management is being taught, the Liberal government's masterpiece from last week will likely be held up as an example. It will be said that this was the most epic failure of crisis management. People will wonder if this is possible. Indeed, it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052006">The crisis reared its head in 2010. In 2010, some people had erected cabins in retaliation for approval of Coastal GasLink. In 2019, the first arrests were made. In December, the RCMP decided to send in Chuck Norris-style snipers. They sent in snipers. That may seem funny, but it is not funny to my constituents who are waiting for the bus. They came up with this idea. This government thought it would be a good idea to send in snipers. It is unbelievable. We cannot remain silent on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052007">This crisis unfolded following the repeated and constant inaction of this government. In today's ministerial statement, it was more of the same lip service. Was there a hint of potential management? No. All we have is a statement that was made on Friday by the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, who told us the situation was serious and there were many consequences to the crisis. Okay, but what are they doing? Who is going to manage this crisis? Who is going to take care of it? We are still waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052008">The Bloc Québécois has been saying all week that we need a crisis committee and a mediator and that we should have been back in the House yesterday to fast-track progress toward the outcome everyone wants, which is a resolution.

              <ParaText id="6052016">Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker for allowing this important debate to take place tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052017">I want to thank my colleague for sharing his experience in his community and what it looks like when a militarized situation is brought toward a conflict that deserves a peaceful solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052018">We know that when we have conflict in our communities, whether it be in Canada or around the world, militarization has not usually brought people solutions. We have to bring down the temperature. To do that, a legitimate call to action would be for the RCMP to leave right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052019"> The call to action is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> go there, sit at the table and meaningfully negotiate. That means coming to the table with a commitment to negotiate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052020">The member has seen first-hand what this has done in his community, the pain and suffering. I am sure this experience is triggering to a lot of people in his community. We should learn from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052021"> Chief Woos, the heredity chief of the Wet'suwet'en, was just on the news. He said, “We're not going to talk with a gun pointed at our heads.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052022">It is pretty clear that we cannot move forward unless the RCMP leaves and the government is ready to meaningfully negotiate in a peaceful way. The pathway forward has to be one where we are all at the table, without the RCMP being present, so the community can come forward with a peaceful proposal and we can walk forward together. However, it has to be led by the Wet'suwet'en. They are calling on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to be at the table. Does he support that call to action?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052024">From what I heard, it seems that Mr. Norton is setting down “his conditions” to resolve the situation in British Columbia. One of those conditions, which is also one of the proposed solutions, is to have the RCMP withdraw. Obviously there is a connection between the two, and the member was right to mention it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052025">This is a situation where we need to sit down and negotiate. We need to work together to find solutions, but I repeat that someone needs to take charge. In negotiations, the parties need to pull in a single direction to move forward the right way and that means someone needs to take charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052026">Unfortunately, this government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are not taking the initiative.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6052027">Madam Speaker, today we are talking about the rail blockades, but what we are really talking about is a screw-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052028">We are talking about a Liberal screw-up that is not only a Liberal screw-up, but also a Canadian screw-up. Right now, the government just does not want to get involved. I will get to the rail blockade situation in a bit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052029">For example, the government has taken a hands-off approach to letting rail companies regulate themselves. They pretty much get to decide which rules work for them. That leads to consequences such as accidents and explosions. Quebeckers remember the Lac-Mégantic tragedy like it happened yesterday, and I do not think they will forget it anytime soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052030">The government has also taken a hands-off approach to rail traffic control centres. In 2012, which was not that long ago, there were five rail traffic control centres in Canada. Soon there will be just two: one for Canadian National, or CN, and one for Canadian Pacific, or CP. What happens if there is an accident? Nobody knows. Rail traffic will be shut down across the country. Nobody will be able to do anything about it, and we will end up in the same situation we are in now thanks to that hands-off policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052031">The government also takes a hands-off approach to the Indian Act, a law rooted in colonialism and paternalism that Canada forced on indigenous peoples in 1876. This act essentially treated indigenous peoples like children who were then told what was good for them. This created a bitter and tense atmosphere. The act was implemented in 1867. This is 2020. There are quite a few years between 1876 and 2020. How can it have taken so long to consider the possibility that the act does not reflect reality? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052032">The government has not made this clear. We have heard some complaints from the government. It half-heartedly says that it was not perfect. We know what the problem is. The problem is that damn Indian Act. This piece of legislation is catastrophic for indigenous peoples, and they have never accepted it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052033">In the long term, the current crisis is the result of the Indian Act. In the short term, the other problem is the Liberal government. This is why I am talking about the Canadian government as a whole and about the Liberal government. There is the long term and the short term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052034">Rail blockades have quietly popped up all over Canada. After the first few blockades, the government buried its head in the sand. They would not answer their phones and no one knew what was going on. They acted like nothing was wrong, like everything was fine. It boggles the mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052035">There were news stories about the situation, including images of people blockading rail lines. On the government side, there was no response, no spokesperson, no sign, no light. That got people's attention. Rather than taking action, meeting with people or taking any initiative right away, the government let things go. Days passed and the blockades did not go away; rather, they multiplied. Suddenly, there was not just one blockade, there were two, three, four or five. I do not know how many there are, for I am not counting. In a situation like this, one can no longer continue to say there is no problem and simply look the other way, because the blockades are everywhere. Both CN and VIA Rail decided to halt all trains, but that has caused problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052036">My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252770" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation>, was just saying that he tried to contact the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>, but that they could not be reached. He did not hear from them. It was difficult to understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052037">Also, the <Affiliation DbId="253365" Type="4">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> was nowhere to be found. There was no response or leadership from her. We do not know where she was during this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052038">As for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, he was abroad. He was trying to win a seat on the UN Security Council, which is not a bad thing in and of itself. The problem is that when the house is on fire, they must deal with the problems instead of looking for gratification elsewhere. In my opinion, the government's management of the situation has been disastrous thus far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052039"> The <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> was missing in action. We did not see him and we did not know where he was. The first time we saw him was at the meeting with the provincial first ministers. As there were cameras at the meeting, we were unable to say anything. What we finally learned was that the minister washed his hands of the situation and that the provinces were to find a solution.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052040">Initially there was a blockade in British Columbia, but now they are everywhere. The entire rail system is blocked. This is not a matter of telling one little province to deal with its problems. Everyone is suffering. I think the government is totally out of touch with its management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052041">It is disappointing because it took just about a week before the government started to say that there may be a problem. What happened during that week? Nothing happened. There were blockades, people protested, goods stopped being shipped. The government did nothing. It let the situation fester. Obviously, when a situation is allowed to fester, everything around it gets soiled and the situation gets worse. The wound turns gangrenous and becomes harder to deal with. Obviously this has been mismanaged, and the other side needs to change course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052042">Faced with everyone's anger, the government finally had to consider that there might be a problem and it might have to start giving it some thought. Over the weekend, a few pitiful ministers attended meetings here and there, their heads hanging low. They felt they had no choice but to go talk to them, but they should have done that a week earlier. It is rather disappointing. In fact, it is quite disappointing because the result was actually not bad. One blockade was lifted, but elsewhere nothing moved and the blockades are still there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052043">Members will understand our disappointment. The government should have grabbed the bull by the horns and gone to see these people from the start. It should have taken these people into consideration, as they are protesting for good reason. They are not happy that a pipeline is being shoved down their throats. In Quebec, we would not be happy either if energy east were shoved down our throats. I think there would be major protests if that happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052044">Plus, these people are not happy with how they are being treated under the Indian Act. They have every reason to complain. We need to listen to them and pay attention to the problem they are dealing with. We cannot ignore them and look the other way when there is a problem, and we cannot leave businesses in the lurch. There is no comparison. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052045">Here is the situation: CN sent 450 people home. They cannot work because the rail line is not operational. This might be just the beginning. That number could climb to 1,000, 2,000 or 6,000 people, because a lot of people work there. If people cannot work, CN is not going to pay them to sit at their desks and twiddle their thumbs. Things have to move.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052046">Right now, CN is not moving. Soon, grocery stores will realize they cannot stock their shelves and will have to truck goods in. They will have to raise their prices because it is going to cost them 25% more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052047">Farmers, schools and hospitals are not getting propane, and people are very worried that we could soon end up with a propane shortage. Cities could run out of chlorine and be unable to treat their water. Drinking water is an important issue. If this continues, the port of Montreal will no longer be able to receive ships. That seems to have been the implication today. The port would be blocked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052048">I think about the businesses in my riding that are being hit hard. ArcelorMittal employs nearly 2,000 people back home. The company tells us that it will have to slow production at some point. The metals are no longer coming in, and the company cannot produce stock. Danone, which employs hundreds of people in my riding and supplies all of the yogourt in this country, is saying the same thing. The yogourt will not be good anymore, and they do not know what to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052049">Today, faced with all these problems, we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said he would make a ministerial statement in the House of Commons, but who did not say anything. He simply repeated the same things, namely that there was a problem and that they are going to try to have a dialogue. There is no solution, no action plan. It is rather discouraging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052050">The Bloc Québécois proposed some solutions. We proposed creating a war room from the start. The government did not do that. It waited. Then we proposed a mediator. The government did nothing. It waited. We proposed recalling the House yesterday. The government did not want to. We are also proposing, at the very least, that work on the Coastal GasLink pipeline be suspended. That might be good for dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052051">We would like the government to listen to our suggestions and put them into action. At the end of the day, it could also study the Indian Act properly and make it consistent with the requirements and needs of the first nations.</ParaText>

These indigenous communities on the west coast of Vancouver Island that are Nuu-chah-nulth have been fighting to prove and establish their inherent right, which we know they already have, in the courts of this country. They won in the Supreme Court of Canada in 2009, and the Harper government appealed it. They won again, and then the current government appealed it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052058">The Liberal government and the Harper government spent $19 million just on government lawyers in fighting these indigenous people who live in a remote community. Many of them live on Flores Island and want the right to catch and sell the fish that are swimming right by their village. This is a community with 70% unemployment and much suicide. The cost of not taking action is killing people. This is what reconciliation looks like in this country. That is why people are rising across this country.</ParaText>

Since then, our government has passed Bill <Document DbId="10344307" Type="3">C-92</Document> so that all first nations would be able to pass their own child well-being laws and no longer be subject to section 88 of the Indian Act, which gave provinces laws of general application for things other than where Canada was explicit about the rights of first nations on health and education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052075">Across Canada, over half of the Indian Act bands are now sitting down at tables to work on their priorities as they assert their jurisdiction. From education to fisheries to child and family services to policing or to their own court systems, we have made important strides forward in the hard work of, as Lee Crowchild describes it, deconstructing the effects of colonization.</ParaText>

Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> means that indigenous peoples and indigenous knowledge will be mandatory at the very beginning of a proposal for any major project.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052092">Canadians acknowledge that there has been a difference of opinion among the Wet'suwet'en peoples. We have heard often in the House that 20 elected chiefs and council agreed to the project in consultation with their people. Women leaders have expressed an opinion that the project can eliminate poverty or provide meaningful work for young men and reduce domestic violence and incarceration. Some have expressed that in an indigenous world view, providing an energy source that will reduce China's reliance on coal is good for Mother Earth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052142"> There was a very lengthy process for approval. It is an approximately 670-kilometre pipeline that delivers gas from the Dawson Creek area to a facility near Kitimat, B.C. for export. It is seen as something that has an opportunity not only for economic benefit for Canada, but for supporting a decrease in global emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052143">We know 20 elected chiefs have supported the project. I understand a number of hereditary chiefs have also supported it. This process included a number of communities, and the elected councils took the project to referendum for approval. This is not just the elected chiefs saying, yes. In many communities, there was a referendum process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052144">Clearly, a group of hereditary chiefs are opposed. However, another significant point is that some of those chiefs actually ran for elected council and did not win their seats.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052147">Again, clearly there has been trouble brewing for months, but the government has allowed it to grow into a full-blown crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052148">We now have groups like Extinction Rebellion, Climate Justice, among others, who play the key role in the protest. They have been described by many, including some of the Wet’suwet’en people, as outsiders exploiting a division within the first nations community in the hope of creating chaos. For many, I think this is a dress rehearsal for the Trans Mountain pipeline and any future energy project. Their goal is not to deal with the challenging governance issues of first nations communities, but it is to shut down energy infrastructure across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052170">Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to support the Wet'suwet'en people. Over the past weeks, news organizations from coast to coast have mobilized to every blockade and every protest, vying for sound bites and clips to share on the morning news and on their social media. Who has been forgotten in all of this? It seems to me it is the people of Wet'suwet'en nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052171">Politicians across Canada and in this House have taken it upon themselves to speak on behalf of the people. I do not want to even pretend to speak on behalf of these people, because I think that would be foolish for me to claim to do so. It would lack credibility and integrity. Let me be clear, however. We are at a very important point in our history, and I intend to be on the side of the Wet'suwet'en people tonight, who have the right to self-determination and to control their own destiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052172">The elected leadership of all 20 first nations whose territory runs along the pathway of Coastal GasLink, eight hereditary chiefs and over 80% of the people are in favour of getting this pipeline built. I was the mayor of the city of Meadow Lake for eight years and I know just how difficult it is to get 80% support for a project. It is nearly impossible. That is why I appreciate the hard work that the elected chiefs have put in to negotiate an extremely successful deal with Coastal LNG on behalf of their people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052173">There is over $1 billion in commitments to indigenous workers and to indigenous-owned firms because of this project. These dollars could be used for important investments in these communities such as housing, mental health, education, recreation and many other things. However, it is not just about the dollars being invested in these communities; it is about the creation of well-paid, sustainable jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052174">I represent a riding that has a population that is over 70% indigenous. During the election campaign and in the months since, I have had many opportunities to talk to people about my vision for northern Saskatchewan, to talk to people about the opportunity to have well-paying, sustainable jobs. It is a very similar theme to what we talk about tonight when we consider this project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052175">The benefits I have spoken about over and over again are threefold. First, there is an obvious economic benefit that comes with having a good job and being able to take care of oneself and one's family. Second, there is an innate need in each of us to be fulfilled, to feel valued and to have a sense of self-worth. There is nothing greater than the feeling one experiences after coming home, having put in an honest day's work. Third, the most important benefit that I have been talking about over the last several months is the hope that comes from the opportunity of having a good job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052176">Youth suicide in northern remote communities is very real, and it is a heartbreaking crisis. I have spoken many times about how the suicide crisis in northern Saskatchewan is due to a lack of hope. When young people can look up to those they respect and admire, such as their parents, their uncles, their brothers and sisters, or maybe their older cousins, and see them succeed by being part of the industry in northern Saskatchewan, they have hope. They have hope for a better future and they no longer have to consider suicide. I realize that a good job does not solve every problem, but it sure is a good start and it goes a long way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052177">The question becomes how we create these jobs. I have spoken consistently about creating partnerships between indigenous communities and private industry. These partnerships create opportunity for people in remote northern communities to fully participate in the economic well-being of Canada as a whole. This project is a perfect example of that model at work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052178">We simply cannot allow a minority of protesters to stand in the way of the will of the Wet'suwet'en nation. These protesters have taken extraordinary measures to hold Canada hostage, compromising the safety of our rail infrastructure, blocking and intimidating people attempting to go to work and in some cases physically assaulting elected members of a provincial legislature. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052179">These blockades have had real effects on my constituents. I have heard from farmers in my riding that many are being told they will not be able to deliver the grain they have contracted for February and March. Canada's reputation as a stable supplier is at risk. Our farmers are risking losing global customers, and they will find other suppliers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052180">These are people's livelihoods we are talking about. It is how they feed their families. It is what heats their homes. These blockades have to end. If we allow a small minority to succeed in blocking this project, I am concerned that it will be impossible for future projects to ever see the light of day.</ParaText>

I also said that as a mayor, one can never expect to get 100% consensus on a decision and, ultimately, that is the value of a democratic institution.

I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> for initiating this important emergency debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052209">I want to cover a number of different issues in my speech this evening. First is the notion of protest and its importance in our democracy and under our constitution. The notion of lawful protest is critical. It is protected in multiple subsections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly subsections 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052210">What we understand as a protest is critical, as is the manner in which it unfolds. What do I mean by that? We have heard extensive discussions over the last 12 days about protesting in accordance with the law and the rule of law. This is critical and needs to always be respected in this country in order for the protest function to fulfill its important purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052211">I am speaking tonight because it is important that the people watching and participating in this debate understand that there is frustration out there. It is being experienced on many fronts. As the member of Parliament for Parkdale—High Park, I have heard about this frustration in my riding from my constituents, who have raised their voices with me in multiple contexts: via email, on the phone and in person. They have taken different sides on this issue. Some have raised their frustration with reconciliation and the commitment to climate change, asking what is going on in terms of those important precepts. Others have asked about their economic livelihood and the standstill happening in the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052212">There is frustration being experienced by so many people in this country right now. It is the reason we are here debating this into the wee hours of the evening and why the frustration needs to be validated and understood. People are frustrated and they deserve to be frustrated. It is important for all of us to understand this and work toward the common goal, which is a speedy resolution to this dispute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052213">The fundamental question is how we get there. We heard a lot about this today, both in tonight's debate and in the ministerial presentations and statements made earlier today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052214">When we talk about the resolution to this matter, we have a pretty strong juxtaposition presented to us. On the one hand, the notion of dialogue has been undertaken with mutual respect, dialogue that would work toward a meaningful and peaceful resolution. Who suggested that dialogue? We heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in his ministerial statement, talk about the need for dialogue and extending a hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052215">Also of importance, we heard from National Chief Perry Bellegarde today, who echoed the need for peaceful, respectful dialogue. We have heard this from some of the leaders of the Mohawk first nation as well, who have echoed the need for moving forward in a manner that facilitates discussion among the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052216">On the other hand, we have a stark contrast that was articulated earlier today by the opposition, which is escalation and potentially the use of force by law enforcement officials, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Let me say to you quite clearly, Madam Speaker, and to everyone who is watching at this late hour, that I find that approach very problematic. I am going to underscore several reasons why I believe that is problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052217">The first is that we do not instruct the police in this country on who to arrest or release. That is very important because the police in this country, indeed I would say the police in any functioning democracy, are not the private force of the political party in power. That is so fundamental that it should go without saying. In a democracy, the police work within a broader legislative framework or under the underpinnings of a statutory framework, but in their day-to-day functions, they operate independently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052218">Why do I say this and what basis do I have for this claim? I am going to point out a few authoritative sources, the first of which is the Supreme Court of Canada. It has outlined that the principle of police independence “underpins the rule of law” and is necessary for the “maintenance of public order and preservation of the peace”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052219">I am entering into my former vocation as a lawyer here, but I will cite the Campbell and Shirose case, which is a 1999 decision of the Supreme Court, at paragraphs 29 and 33, directly from the Court's judgment, where it is stated:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052222">There are further instances of this being articulated in other judicial fora or commissions of inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052223"> After the APEC summit was held, there was an inquiry into what transpired there. In that APEC inquiry, Justice Hughes stated five principles of police independence. One of the principles he articulated is that when the RCMP is performing law enforcement functions, it is entirely independent of the federal government and answerable only to the law and the courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052224">The final instance I want to bring to the attention of the House is the Arar commission. We all know the infamous case of Maher Arar. We also know about Dennis O'Connor's inquiry into the circumstances that led to Maher Arar's rendition and torture in a foreign jurisdiction. At page 458 of the report, Justice O'Connor said:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The outer limits of police independence continue to evolve, but its core meaning is clear: the Government should not direct police investigations and law enforcement decisions in the sense of ordering the police to investigate, arrest or charge—or not to investigate, arrest or charge—any particular person.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052226">Where are we situated here? We are situated in a context where multiple things are being suggested by multiple people not only in this chamber but around the country. Some would say it is time for politicians to lay down the law, so to speak, and instruct law enforcement officials to make arrests or use force in a given context, particularly with the Wet'suwet'en protesters. Others have said we should be instructing the police to do the opposite and remove themselves from the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052227">My position, and that of this government, is that it is not for the police to be directed to either arrest or withdraw. That is not the operational independence that is sacrosanct to the protection of the rule of law in a functioning democracy. We have to allow police officers to operate independently, as they do to this point. It is very critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052228">I also want to emphasize in this debate what has harkened back to me. I am older than I appear and people tend to confuse me for my age, but I remember very clearly the Ipperwash situation in Ontario, my home province, in the mid-1990s, when the premier, then of the Conservative ilk, decided to issue a blunt direction. It is not really worth repeating, but it was something along the lines of, “Get the Indian out of the park.” There are a few more choice words in that quotation. That led to an entire inquiry into the role of elected leaders with respect to the supervision, enforcement and instruction of law enforcement officials. The Ipperwash Inquiry found, to the same extent of some of the inquiries I have mentioned, that this role is entirely inappropriate. It is inappropriate because it jeopardizes the foundation upon which this democracy, and indeed any democracy, operates. The police are not a private force under the employ of the political party in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052229"> I started with two options, dialogue versus direct action and enforcement, and on this side of the House we side with the option of dialogue. How is that dialogue proceeding? I will cite some of the instances members and hopefully those watching have already heard about this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052230">Dialogue has already commenced. We heard able argumentation presented by the <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> at the start of tonight's debate about the engagement he has already had with the Mohawk leaders. We have heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, who has met with indigenous Canadians. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> has already had discussions on the telephone with individuals, including the hereditary chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation. We know that she is readily available to meet directly and in person with those hereditary chiefs to continue this critical dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052231">Let us talk about those with whom we are having dialogue, because I think this is also one of the core issues that is germane to the debate this evening. We believe that all indigenous stakeholders, elected representatives and hereditary chiefs should be involved in this discussion and dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052232">I am going to give members an anecdote from my somewhat still nascent parliamentary career, which is about five years old.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052233">One of the privileges that I had in the last Parliament was to work on the indigenous language protection act. That was an incredibly difficult file at times but also an incredibly rewarding file. I am very proud to say that all parliamentarians supported the bill, which has now restored the vitality, promotion and protection of indigenous languages that were at various stages of risk in this country. That was a very illustrative exercise for me when I was working as parliamentary secretary on that bill, because I was leading some of the consultations around the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052234">What I quickly learned in that situation was that there is a great amount of heterogeneity among indigenous communities, stakeholders, elders, teachers, students, etc., around this country. Whether we are dealing with first nations, Inuit or Métis people, there are a lot of different opinions, and that is as it should be. No one entity or no one group speaks for the entire group. There is as much diversity of opinion among indigenous stakeholders as there is among non-indigenous stakeholders. Again, it is simplistic in its analysis but the illustration was very clear to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052235">What I learned with that exercise was that while there are a multiplicity of views out there on any issue that touches indigenous people in this country, what is important when we are dealing with indigenous issues and indigenous stakeholders is that none of those views should be ignored. That is critical when we are trying to give flesh to this idea of reconciliation and what reconciliation means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052236">It is fundamentally different and qualitatively different. I do not think anyone in this chamber would disagree. When we are trying to pursue an equitable issue with respect to immigrant groups or racialized groups or a religious minority, those are important objectives. When we are dealing with the history and legacy of 400 years of colonialism and racism and the legacy of the residential school system, it is qualitatively different. It is what we call sui generis in the legal context. It is qualitatively different because we cannot ignore any of the voices. That is fundamental and it needs to be clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052237">I also want to add a further layer to this debate. A lot of the people who come into my office in Parkdale—Hyde Park or speak to me about this, or reach out by email or social media, talk about the indigenous cause being the vanguard of a broader cause, a respect for Mother Earth, a respect for Mother Nature, a respect for the land that is so bountiful. It is caught up with this issue, and rightfully so, about the pressing need for action on climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052238">I take no issue with that. I fundamentally believe that climate action is urgent. I fundamentally believe that when we declare an emergency on climate change in the House, we need to stand by that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052239">I return to the fact that folks in my riding and folks right around this country have always consistently approached this issue to me in terms of its broader gravity. They would tell me we have an emergency. They would say to me that it is not just an emergency in Canada, but that it is a global emergency. I would readily concur with them. That is absolutely right. We have a global problem so what we need is a global solution. What I say to them in the context of tonight's debate is to think about this project as part of that global problem and global solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052240">What do I mean by that? We know and people who are viewing this tonight understand that this project was touted as the single largest private sector investment in Canadian history, $40 billion deep. Why is that? It is because this project has the ability to provide the cleanest liquefied natural gas facility on earth and to provide green energy to locations around the planet that are in need of greener sources of energy. What I mean by that is ensuring that the phase-out of coal in large Asian nations, particularly India and China, can be accelerated through this liquefied natural gas. What I urge people to consider is that jeopardizing this project will impede the ability of Canada to contribute a global solution to what is indeed a global problem. That is an important factor to consider in this context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052241">I would venture so far as to put it that this single factor is the reason why we had parties and governments of different political stripes, a provincial NDP government working in close collaboration with a federal Liberal government, working together, and why we had indigenous leaders lining up behind this original project, including all of the elected council representatives for the various first nations groups that are affected with respect to this project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052242">In total, was there an absolute consensus? Clearly there was not and there is not. That is why we are here today. The voices of the hereditary chiefs have been articulated, indicating that they are speaking out, and they are speaking out on behalf of their people on this very important substantive issue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="05">(2205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052243">Those voices cannot be denied. Those voices are the ones that need to be listened to and the ones that need to be addressed if we are to give reconciliation some meaning. That is the meaningful dialogue and peaceful resolution that we are working toward in this context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052244">I would reiterate some aspects of what has been transpiring with respect to the RCMP, in the brief time that I have remaining. That law enforcement agency, I am glad to say, has been facilitating a different approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052245">In this context, with respect to Wet'suwet'en, the RCMP are attempting to work with what we call a measured approach that is facilitating lawful, peaceful and safe protest in an environment that is safe for protesters and members of the public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052246">That is a departure from traditional enforcement-focused policing. It is a measured approach that places a premium on open communication and mitigation efforts where the use of arrest becomes just one of the many options that would be available to law enforcement. Indeed, the use of arrest is kept as a last resort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052247">It also encourages police to undertake proactive engagement. Having a measured approach calls for communication, mitigation and facilitation measures to ensure they maintain peace and to facilitate the resolution of public disorder and the restoration of peace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052248">It is also critical that the RCMP, which employs a measured approach, respects the lawful exercise of personal rights and freedoms, including the rights of peaceful assembly and association, which I outlined at the outset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052249">What I am saying in this context is that we have got the fundamental issue of protest. We have to balance that so that it is done in accordance with the rule of law. We have this issue about how we approach the protest: Do we encourage action and enforcement measures, including the use of force by the police at the direction of elected officials, or do we pursue dialogue? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052250">I am very strongly in favour of the dialogue option. The dialogue must engage all parties involved in the conflict, including the hereditary leaders, and that dialogue must consider the impact of climate action that we could take here in Canada that could impact the global climate problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052251">Those are the issues that are at stake here. Those are the issues that are fundamental to this debate. I invite questions from the hon. members.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052268">The first point is that it is an absolute presence of leadership to convene Parliament and address the chamber as <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, ensure that the ministers are tasked with commencing that dialogue, and put value into the dialogue that he is spearheading himself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052269">The second point is with respect to clean water, and I will stand by our government's record. We have a record of having lifted 88 boil-water advisories thus far. We are on track to eliminate all of them by March 2021 by investing well over $1 billion in the infrastructure required to address the very significant need for clean drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052270">The third point is with respect to litigation against indigenous children, which is a problematic piece of litigation. The member opposite knows that we have admitted responsibility, that we accept the fact that discrimination has been found. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052271">What we are working on right now is an agreement that will include a more encompassing group, including a pending class action, so that a larger body of people can have justice rendered to them so that inequality can be addressed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052273">However, there is a degree to which this issue and the people involved in the project are being co-opted to reinforce multiple political narratives.

              <ParaText id="6052274"> We can certainly all agree, I hope, that a peaceful process and a resolution that results in no violence is in everyone's best interests. However, the language that we have heard from the <Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> is anything but peaceful, as he suggested that indigenous people “check their privilege”.

              <ParaText id="6052294">This government has learned nothing from past crises, all of which were the result of the government's inaction, of its inability to respond quickly, which only led to the situation deteriorating, and also to various drastic and unfortunate actions. That is just the reality. The government has learned nothing. Now it is attempting to blame its lack of understanding of the crisis and its handling of previous crises on the Conservatives' own lack of understanding, when in fact, it is the other way around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052295">I would like to talk about a crisis that hit Quebec in 1998. In 1998, 350 pork producers decided to blockade Highway 20. These 350 pork producers were desperate and had made certain demands. I am not talking about the demands made by the Wet'suwet'en. That is not the issue I am concerned with at the moment. What I am interested in is the government's response to that crisis. No matter how legitimate these demands may be, the crisis at hand goes far beyond the demands of this particular indigenous nation. There are people getting involved who are not at all concerned with these demands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052296">As I was saying, 350 pork producers had blockaded Highway 20 in 1998. The crisis lasted five days. All things considered, that is a long time. For five whole days, Highway 20 was closed to automobile traffic. How was the crisis resolved? The then premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, instructed the Sûreté du Québec to let the people involved know that the blockade would be lifted, that the police would have to get involved. The very next day, the situation was resolved in an orderly and respectful fashion. No major police intervention was needed. The blockade ended. That is the reality. How can such crises be expected to be resolved without setting an expiry date? Members know just how long these kinds of discussions can last.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052297">As long as these discussions last, there will be people who are suffering. No amount of discussions will improve the situation of those who are suffering. We will not be able to improve the situation of those who are bearing the brunt of these blockades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052298">I would now like to return to the Leader of the Opposition's speech today. He very eloquently expressed everyday Canadians' thoughts on the current situation. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s speech, on the other hand, was akin to a word salad. He had absolutely nothing to offer to resolve the situation. He simply stated that we would have to continue to wait for the crisis to resolve itself. That is an accurate summation of the Prime Minister's speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052299">The Prime Minister convened the House and all its members to state that he had an important announcement to make to the nation. In the end, he delivered an utterly wishy-washy speech that was entirely devoid of substance and ultimately accomplished nothing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="25">(2225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052300">In spite of the Prime Minister's speech tonight and in spite of his invitation for all parties to enter into a dialogue to find a solution, the blockades persist. The situation is the same as it was before the speech and absolutely nothing has been fixed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052301">It really was nothing more than a word salad designed to appease, one that drove home the point that no one has been doing a thing for 13 days, that no one has stepped in and that no one would be stepping in because, after all, no one really knows what to do. That is essentially what we have heard today from the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052302">In his speech, the Prime Minister had already suggested that he disagreed with the Conservatives' position. Then, we learned that he had invited all party leaders to a meeting, except the leader of the Conservative Party, which is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052303">Our leader said today that the Prime Minister's statement was a complete abdication of responsibility and of leadership. I am in complete agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052304"> Our leader added that, “standing between our country and prosperity is a small group of radical activists, many of whom have little to no connection to first nations communities.” He added that these “radical activists...will not rest until our oil and gas industry is entirely shut down.” Finally, he said that “they are blockading our ports, railways, borders, roads and highways”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052305">I looked at images of various blockades and I read #shutdowncanada and #nopipeline. That is the reality. What is the connection to the indigenous community's demands? Meanwhile, in my riding, people are suffering, they are going through terrible times and they just cannot cope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052306">I want to mention a few businesses in the riding of <Affiliation DbId="252712" Type="2">Beauce</Affiliation>, which my colleague represents. Propane GRG in Sainte-Marie is running out of stock and is delivering only to essential services. It is the middle of winter, and the company has to ration its customers and deliver only 20% of what it usually delivers. The vice-president of Propane GRG, Patrice Breton, says the business is on life support until an agreement ends the blockades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052307">The rail blockades set up by indigenous people in Lac-Mégantic are hurting businesses in the Eastern Townships. The Tafisa plant, for example, has been unable to supply its clients since the crisis began. As a result, 350 workers have been taken hostage by this crisis because, for 13 days, the Prime Minister has not done a single thing to even attempt to resolve the crisis. For the time being, Tafisa has been able to dispose of its stock by filling wagons that are parked in a train yard between Lac-Mégantic and Montreal. The harbours are at capacity. In short, the situation is unacceptable. If it persists, the company will have to lay off staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052308">I also received a message from a dairy farmer in the Lac-Mégantic region tonight. I would like to read it again. “Hey Luc. Because of the crisis with the indigenous folks and the rail blockades, our livestock will soon be going hungry. Anything you can do to shake things up and move things along would be appreciated, because the viability of our businesses is on the line. The situation is still manageable, but our stocks are dwindling, and by next week, the grain centres will be emptied out.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052309">The health of small farms in my riding and in many other regions of Canada is at stake, but the crisis is also having other repercussions, namely, price fluctuations. Kernel corn prices for producers have risen by $10 to $15 per tonne since the crisis started. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052310">We are in the midst of a national crisis, and meanwhile, all we are hearing from the other side of the House is that we need to be patient. They say that no instructions are being given to the RCMP, but the RCMP is being told that discussions are being sought.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052311">There has been no rhyme or reason to the Liberals' management of this crisis. We expect a lot more from a government, and a lot more from a Prime Minister.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052332">Mr. Speaker, I am certainly grateful for this emergency debate tonight, because Canada is facing a crisis of leadership that is threatening the whole economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052333">This crisis is not really about whether indigenous communities support Coastal GasLink, because every local first nation does support it. A majority of the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs support it too. One of them, Theresa Tait-Day, said their whole community voted on it and “85% of our people said yes” to this project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052334"> Chief Larry Nooski of the Nadleh Whuten said “Coastal GasLink represents a once in a generation economic development opportunity” for his nation, and that they “negotiated hard...to guarantee that Nadleh people, including youth, have the opportunity to benefit directly and indirectly...while at the same time, ensuring that the land and the water is protected....”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052335">Chris Sankey, a former elected band councillor for the Lax Kw’alaams First Nation, said, “We need jobs. We need to build homes and roads and schools for our kids and care centres for our elders. These projects will help us do that.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052336">This crisis really hangs on the question of whether Canada is a country where the rule of law is respected and upheld, or whether Canada has succumbed to the rule of the mob. It is about whether Canadians will let our entire economy be held hostage by a small group trampling the legal system that has governed our country for more than 150 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052337">This morning, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s statement was a complete and sad abdication of responsibility and leadership. The Prime Minister himself has emboldened and encouraged this kind of behaviour by cancelling other big projects based on political and activist considerations, like vetoing northern gateway, imposing Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> and funding TMX pipeline opponents, instead of on science and facts, and on the best interests of the whole country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052338">As an MP for an oil and gas riding and for nine indigenous communities, and as a person who happens to be part Ojibwa, I suggest his actions look a lot like those of a centralist, colonialist government imposing its views against the wishes and the priorities of local indigenous governments and the majority of directly impacted indigenous people, such as those in my riding, which are all involved in the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052339">Every single person in this country has the right to freedom of speech and the freedom to protest, but they do not have the right to break the law or to hold the Canadian economy hostage. Because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has yet to clearly denounce the actions of these radical activists as illegal, or to provide an action plan that will end the illegal blockades, rail lines continue to be shut down. Bridges, roads and highways are blocked.

              <ParaText id="6052361">Of course, Coastal GasLink does not just offer opportunity for indigenous communities. It is good for all of Canada, and it will benefit the world. Clean Canadian natural gas will reduce global emissions and deliver the affordable energy the world requires to reduce poverty and to increase the quality of life of the 2.6 billion people without access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052362"> The International Energy Agency projects the average global energy demand will increase approximately 30% by 2040 as world populations and economies expand, adding the equivalent of another China or India to the current level of global energy consumption. Natural gas is projected to meet one-third of that new demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052363">As the fourth-largest natural gas producer with the fifth-largest reserves in the world, Canada can and should help meet that need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052364">Canadian natural gas is abundant, and it is the most viable fuel for reducing domestic and global emissions. Life-cycle emissions associated with LNG can be 20% lower than diesel, 60% lower than coal, 20% less than gasoline, and, crucially, emit less particulate matter, meaning less smog.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052365">Canada LNG and the associated Coastal GasLink pipeline is the largest private sector commitment to the energy sector in Canadian history. It will give Canada the long-sought opportunity to export clean Canadian gas to foreign markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052366"> However, over $100 billion in LNG projects alone have been cancelled since the Liberals came to power, and that is not including other major oil infrastructure they killed. When LNG projects like Pacific Northwest, Grassy Point and Aurora are cancelled, it is devastating to the indigenous communities, local municipalities, service and supply businesses, and all the workers who were counting on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052367">The lack of new pipeline access and LNG facilities in Canada is forcing natural gas producers to sell their product at a massive discount, and natural gas prices have even gone negative, meaning that producers have had to pay someone to take their product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052368"> Liberal policies already left Canada out of the loop the first time, and could cause Canada to miss out on the second wave of the huge opportunity of LNG. In fact, the B.C. government had to agree to exempt LNG Canada from the Liberals' job-killing carbon tax hike in order to ensure that it went ahead. This is just another example of how Liberal policies are impeding resource development and driving private sector investments and businesses out of Canada. This is costing Canadian workers and indigenous people their jobs, and undermining their aspirations, work and hopes for self-sufficiency. It is driving increasing poverty rates in rural and remote regions and diminishing Canada's role in the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052373">When we talk about the time between the initial conflict and where we are today, the province is fundamentally the lead in this. Where the federal government can play a role is oversight, in some ways, of the RCMP, and by being at the table and supporting provincial efforts. One way is to escalate conflict and the other way is to de-escalate the situation. When we talk about removing the blockades, that is the ultimate goal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052389">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague for Sydney—Victoria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052390">I will start today by acknowledging that we are standing here on the traditional territory of the Algonquin people. It is also a privilege to serve as a member of Parliament for a riding that includes the unceded traditional territory of the Squamish, Lil'Wat and Sechelt nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052391">Our government is committed to advancing reconciliation with indigenous peoples through a renewed nation-to-nation, government-to-government relationship based on recognitions of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership. Indeed, this is our most important relationship, and a relationship we have neglected for far too much of our nation's history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052392">We know that building this important relationship is not a quick fix. We never pretended that the road to reconciliation will be quick or easy, but we vow to begin the journey towards a renewed relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052393">While we work toward this aim, first nations are understandably frustrated by a lack of progress in recognition of their fundamental and constitutional rights. The result is that we are now at a boiling point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052394">Today, this is particularly true for the Wet'suwet'en, who have spent many decades working to have their rights and title recognized. The Wet'suwet'en have been leaders across this country in advancing reconciliation. This is evident in the landmark Supreme Court of Canada Delgamuukw case where, for the first time, aboriginal title was recognized as an ancestral right protected by our Constitution. In spite of this landmark case in 1997, not enough progress has been made on this critical relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052395">While indigenous peoples have inherent rights and treaty rights that have been affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution, too often they still have to go to court, first to prove that their rights exist, and then to force the government of the day to implement them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052396"> Our government has taken some of the essential and overdue steps required to renew and build upon Canada's relationship with indigenous peoples to ensure that they have control over their destiny. We have made unprecedented investments to repair and upgrade water and wastewater systems in first nations communities. We are investing in families and children. Through the oceans protection plan, indigenous peoples have new opportunities to protect, preserve and restore Canada's oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052397"> We have also made fundamental changes in our approach to negotiating modern treaties. This is critical for B.C., where already our province is home to many unsettled land claims, but we have examples of reconciliation being successful in some of our modern treaties, especially up north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052398"> I want to raise two examples from my riding that are poignant examples of how reconciliation can work in practice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052399"> First and foremost, this month we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This event was a source of immense pride for all Canadians, as we were able to show the world our rich cultural diversity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052400">This event also allowed us to highlight the incredible history and culture of our indigenous peoples. We did this by partnering with the four host first nations. In this process we allowed first nations to share their languages and to share their culture in celebrations and through new economic partnerships, including through the development of new tourism infrastructure, such as the Squamish Lil'Wat Cultural Centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052401">Second, and perhaps because we are speaking about a crisis that was ignited by a natural gas pipeline, I want to mention the Woodfibre LNG project in my riding. This pipeline and export terminal is situated in the middle of Squamish nation lands. The Squamish were concerned that the existing regulatory processes would not adequately engage with and respond to their concerns, so the nation proposed leading their own environmental assessment process and, lo and behold, the company agreed to be bound by this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052402"> This process went ahead and identified additional conditions for the project. The proposal went back to the nation, which put it to a vote, and the nation ended up approving it. The nation subsequently negotiated an impact benefit agreement with this project. This project will now be monitored by the Squamish to ensure compliance with the conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052403"> I raise this example because adding first nations voices to the table for resource projects does not mean that these projects will not be approved. Rather, these voices help produce projects that are better for the environment, better for the community and better for Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="55">(2255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052404">In fact, this is why we introduced and passed the Impact Assessment Act in the last session. Reforms under the previous Conservative government failed to honour indigenous rights and partnerships, eroded public trust and put our communities at risk. Under the Impact Assessment Act, we create the space for indigenous peoples to run their own environmental assessment process to give first nations a role in the decisions that affect their rights. In addition, early public engagement will ensure reviews happen in partnership with indigenous peoples, communities will have their voices heard and companies know what is required of them, including on issues related to climate change, conservation and environmental protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052405">Having meaningful engagement and consultation with indigenous peoples aims to secure their free, prior and informed consent, and this is not optional. Canada has a legal duty to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate indigenous groups if there could be potential adverse impacts on potential or established aboriginal rights and title. Section 35 of the Constitution makes our fiduciary relationship toward first nations very clear. We cannot continue in the situation we are in today, and it is going to take all of us at all levels of government to find a way forward. What we find ourselves in now is the outcome of reconciliation not making progress and Canadians letting each other down, so we must be utterly committed to repair and improve the systems to keep our country functional and capable of providing the services that we all rely on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052406">The impacts to our transportation systems cannot continue. The transportation sector allows for social linkages. Canadians are feeling the effects of diminished access to family members, community events, education and health services. Railways are a mainstay of rural life in Canada. They offer service, access and connection to more rural and remote places in our country. Rail offers first- and last-mile service, and we cannot fail to connect these Canadians to the services they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052407">I know my colleagues share my concern for Canadians in industries right across the country who are facing layoffs and disruptions to their ability to support themselves and their families. Communities rely on the materials transported by those rail lines, not least among them the families in Atlantic Canada, who rely on propane to heat their homes and are facing rations. We move our food staples by rail from fields to homes. Tens of millions of tonnes of food are transported by rail every year. We need to do better for our communities. An economically healthy Canada is able to uplift, empower and constantly strive to do better for all Canadians. The rail transportation losses our country is facing are in the billions every day, and the need for action has never been more urgent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052408">We have seen the devastating effects of unwarranted force used against our indigenous peoples in Canada. I state in no uncertain terms that force cannot and will not be the resolution to this conflict, nor will our solution be found in endless drawn-out court cases. Together we and our partners need to get out of the courtroom and gather together around the negotiating table. We can find more than resolution; I believe we can find success. We can do better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052409">We can find processes that work for indigenous peoples, but there is nothing that we can achieve if we do not have a conversation. The divides in this country require dialogue. We need to show that we have a process that will lead us down the path to reconciliation. Where we can show that, we can provide an off-ramp to de-escalate the crisis we are in and get our people, goods and economy rolling again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052410">Reconciliation happens when we are able to work together. Reconciliation happens in learning, in redress and in dialogue, and I call upon all parties involved to be part of that solution.</ParaText>

We are looking at propane shortages out east, supplies for hospitals are at risk and thousands of workers will be laid off. These protests must end.</ParaText>

The indigenous peoples of the north shore, the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh people, have spoken out against the imposition by the government with respect to the Trans Mountain pipeline. I am not talking about the $17 billion or $18 billion in public funds the government wants to splurge on this pipeline, I am not talking about the environmental destruction that will come with having tankers going out through the Burrard Inlet and the Salish Sea, I am talking about indigenous peoples in his area, in the north shore, who have spoken out actively against this. I ask the member this: How can we consider the government to be credible in any way on this issue when it is willing to run roughshod over indigenous rights in the case of the Trans Mountain pipeline?</ParaText>

The level of indigenous consultation that happened throughout this process is unheard of in this country. The high level of engagement from officials at the most senior levels would be hard to replicate in any other process. This is the type of example we need to show when we want to improve our nation-to-nation relationship, to have high-level buy-in engagement from our leaders.

One of the areas the member opposite raised was the contribution of natural gas in this process. One of the major changes our government has made over the last couple of years is investing with companies to pursue the electrification of these processes, to lower the life-cycle carbon emissions of this type of extraction. By doing this, it is able to have lower emissions than LNG and natural gas produced in other locations.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6052424">Mr. Speaker, <I>msit no’kmaq</I>, I would like to acknowledge the Algonquin territory on which we meet today. Many of us have acknowledged the traditional territories of indigenous nations on whose land we meet. Some of us go as far as to say we are on unceded land. How many of us give a thought to what that acknowledgement means?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052425">To me, as a Mi'kmaq person, as an indigenous person, it means that we recognize that another group of humans cared for the land, protected the land and maintained it for future generations. We do so out of respect. Maybe we do so out of part of a journey of reconciliation too. While it is an easy thing to say, it is much harder to practise reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052426">Growing up Mi'kmaq, we are raised and taught that we are born with responsibilities to our family, to our community and to our nation, but also responsibilities to the ecosystem. We call it <I>netukulimk</I> in my language. When I think about that responsibility, I think about what actions I am willing to take to ensure the quality of life for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052427">I was a protester, or a land protector, as my colleagues have reminded me. I too was out there on the streets, frustrated during the Idle No More era of protests under the Stephen Harper government that saw environmental cuts and indigenous cuts. I was out there with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052428">It was only when a new government was elected that I believed that Canada had reached a turning point, where Canada could look to a new relationship with indigenous people. It was with this in mind that I entered politics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052429">Because of the work that this government has done to advance reconciliation, I believed that a Mi'kmaq advocate would be welcomed into government. I still believe this today. I believe that reconciliation is possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052430">I believe that reconciliation is not a destination; it is a journey. Just like any relationship we hope to improve and foster, it is only possible when we listen. It is only possible with respect. It is only possible when we find common ground. We have reached a moment in Canada like we have many times before. This will not be the first time that Canadians have called for police action, even military action, in the face of civil disobedience and protest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052431">If the civil rights movement in the U.S. has taught us anything, it is that violence, police or the army will not stop a political movement. It will only lead to more political action, escalation and turmoil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052432">Communication is the only way forward. Good faith negotiation is what the Wet'suwet'en are asking for. I will not go into the comments that my colleague just made about the Wet'suwet'en people in their determination and their fight at the Supreme Court of Canada for recognition of aboriginal title, but they believed it was a victory for them. Many indigenous nations across Canada believed it was a victory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052433">As many have stated today, section 35 of our Constitution, the supreme law of Canada, recognizes aboriginal and treaty rights. Further to that, section 52 states that the Constitution is the supreme law of Canada, and that any other laws that are inconsistent with them are of no force and effect. Therefore, the rule of law is important, but we must ensure that the rule of law is applied equitably among all peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052434">We have a crisis, but this crisis did not unfold in 12 days. This crisis did not unfold in 12 years. It has been unfolding for more than 150 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052435">For more than a decade, I worked for the hereditary chiefs of the Mi'kmaq, as my father did for 30 years before me. They were called the Sante' Mawio'mi. The difference was that they were at the table with elected chiefs while they talked about negotiations moving forward. While it was not always easy, they always found ways to work together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052437">I ask today for leaders in Canada, leaders of both indigenous and non-indigenous people, to commit to making our relationship work. Political action, not police action, has the ability to decrease tensions. It is the only way. Political discussion and negotiation is what is needed, not inflammatory rhetoric. We need to inspire hope. If nothing else during this speech, I want to make sure to say that there is still hope. The politician in me believes that and the protester in me believes that too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052438">We are still here. We have been debating all night, but more importantly, we have been listening all week. We are still listening. I promise we will not stop listening. Reach out to us and let us get back to negotiating and let our families from coast to coast to coast get back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052439">Like any relationship between families, between partners, when we sit down and talk about the issues rather than taking extreme positions that is when we have the ability to grow. We have a chance for growth in our country. We have the ability to take strides and take actions that have only been dreamt about by indigenous leaders in this country in the past. When we say that we are focused on reconciliation, let us show it in all of our actions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052451">Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise that reconciliation is not formed out of crisis. I feel that reconciliation is something that has been 150 years or more in the making. We can all look at recent events and question the government on our actions, but has any other government in the past 150 years acted differently towards indigenous people? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052452">I grew up in a Mi’kmaq community. I lived this every day for 40 years. This is not something I get to come to a meeting here and just say that this is what is happening. I have lived this and have seen it my whole life, and so it is not something that has just recently transpired. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052453">Can we do better? We can all do better. Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said that as part of it, but the biggest thing is what this government is trying to do in taking steps towards reconciliation differently from all governments in the past, including Oka and Ipperwash and the other protests that have happened across this country. What we are asking is that we speak respectfully, speak to people, negotiate and have dialogue. This is what reconciliation means. It is having that patience. Indigenous peoples have had patience in Canada for more than 150 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052454">Let us put this in perspective. There are three million indigenous people out there and there are fewer than 1,000 protesting. I have spent a lot of time listening to a lot of the comments over the past few weeks. I am kind of rambling here, but I get going because I have lived this. This is not just something that I debate on, but I do believe that our government is taking the steps that will lead towards the necessary path of reconciliation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052458">I have heard many of the interventions this evening through this emergency debate and I want to bring a different perspective to this discussion tonight. I want to put this in context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052459">About 20 years ago, a previous Liberal government actually arrested farmers and put them in jail for crossing the border and trying to sell their grain in the United States. In perspective, right now we have protesters illegally blockading critical infrastructure across Canada and a Liberal government that is doing nothing to address that situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052460">I want to talk about the collateral damage of the inaction that is happening and put that in perspective. Canadian farmers who are trying to sell their own grain are arrested and put in jail by the Liberal government. We have protesters, the court has said this is an illegal blockade and the Liberal government is not doing anything. We can imagine the message this is sending to Canadian agriculture. The blockades are bringing Canada's economy to its knees, and there are very real consequences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052461">On Friday, a grain producer from my riding came into my office in High River. I have to admit that it is not often I see farmers and ranchers almost in tears, but this 80-some-year-old farmer was extremely frustrated. He has gone through what has been deemed the harvest of hell this fall. He is now finally getting his crops harvested. Throughout January and February, when there was a nice day, some of the farmers in my riding were out in their combines trying to get whatever crop off they possibly could.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052462">I now have this farmer in my office asking what else he can do. He suffered through one of the worst springs and falls in 60 years of farming. He finally harvested his crops, but now he is dealing with a blockade. There are no trains at the terminal where he could sell his commodities and get his product to market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052463">These are the very real consequences farmers across this country are facing. It is not just in western Canada or in my riding, but in every corner of this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052464">Members across the floor are talking about not wanting to rush this through and wanting to have a discussion and open dialogue and saying they will be there for as long as it takes. However, there are business owners, farmers and ranchers across this country who literally cannot wait for this dialogue and the Liberal government to just stand back and hope that this resolves itself. They will be bankrupt before this is resolved if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to stand on the sidelines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052465">This is not just rhetoric. I have heard from many of my colleagues across the floor that this is rhetoric. I would like to mention the stats of what is going on right now. Currently in the port of Prince Rupert, there are 19 ships waiting to be loaded with grain. They are short 400,000 tonnes of grain that is not there to be loaded. In the port of Vancouver, there are 42 vessels waiting to be loaded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052466">Just in Prince Rupert alone, it is 400,000 tonnes of grain they are waiting for, which is about 4,000 railcars. Every day of waiting is about a million dollars. If we include both ports, every week the cost directly to grain farmers is between $40 million and $50 million. When those ships are not loaded, the demurrage costs are passed directly on to the producers. They cannot pass those costs on to anyone else. They are price takers. They are the end of the line. If we add this up over the four weeks, this has cost Canadian agriculture well over $200 million to $300 million, and that is only in grain. I am not talking about cattle, fertilizer, pork or other commodities. That is only in grain. We can understand the implication this is having on our farmers and ranchers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052467">This is not only on the commodity side. I spoke to a propane dealer today, who said that Quebec and Ontario may have four to five days of propane reserves left and that it is being rationed. I have heard similar stories from Atlantic Canada. This includes farmers who are trying to heat their barns and dry their grain. Every time they turn around, they are getting another punch to the gut. They are throwing up their hands and asking what more can they do and wondering why no one is paying attention to the anxiety, stress and frustration they are feeling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052468">The ironic part on the propane side is that these same farmers are now hit with a Liberal carbon tax, which is costing them tens of thousands of dollars a month.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="25">(2325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052469">We heard from the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan, which said that the carbon tax was equal to 12% of one's revenue just disappearing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052470">The farmers finally got their grain off in the fall. Then they were faced with a CN rail strike, where again the Liberal government did not take any action and decided to stand on the sidelines and wait for it to resolve itself. That is finally now starting to get caught back up. Then in January, farmers were hit with a carbon tax. In February, now they are being hit with illegal blockades across this country and they cannot get their products to market. I hope my colleagues across the floor can see the utter frustration from Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector. Every time they turn around they are getting another punch in the face by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052471">When we asked the <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> if she knew the impact the carbon tax was having on Canadian farmers, her response was that her department was not keeping any data on it and she was hoping to find evidence and data on it. Before one puts in a carbon tax, maybe one should have done an economic impact analysis on the agriculture sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052472">For the last two weeks I have heard the Liberals say that they are not going to enforce the court injunction and they just hope it resolves itself peacefully and quickly. I am sorry, but that is just not good enough. I am absolutely not inciting violence or anything along that line, but sooner or later they have to understand there are real economic consequences to this inaction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052473">I do not know how else I can say this, but Canada's economy is on its knees. Even when this is resolved, whenever that may be, to just assume that Canada's economy is going to pick back up and get back on track is simply not the case. I spoke to CN last week and it is 200 freight trains behind. That will take not days, not weeks, but months to get caught back up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052474">The government also has to understand the implications this has on our global relations with some of our most trusted and important trading partners. They look at Canada as a supplier. They are our customers. What will customers do when the ships they have sent from Japan, China, India, Australia, New Zealand and Peru to be loaded in Vancouver or Prince George are turned around empty? They will take those ships to where they know they are going to get a reliable supply. They will go to Brazil, Peru or the United States. These are customers that we will have lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052475">This impacts our reputation in the global marketplace. More than 50% of the commodities we produce in agriculture are exported. Almost more than any other country in the world, we are reliant on those export markets. We cannot have this unreliability within the critical infrastructure and the supply chain from coast to coast without there being very clear consequences to what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052476">I have talked a lot about the farmers on the ground who are being impacted by this, but I also spoke with Chuck Magro, the president and CEO of Nutrien on Friday to see the impact this was having on its business. It is the largest fertilizer company in North America and is based in Calgary. This is Nutrien's busiest time of the year. It is trying to get its supplies not only across Canada to its domestic customers but also to ships to send it around the world. If these blockades are not removed in the very near future, Nutrien will be forced to shut down some of its most important plants across Canada and lay off people. Nutrien is now 125 railcars short and that number continues to grow each and every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052477">In conclusion, I want to be crystal clear to my colleagues across the floor that there are very real consequences to this inaction and this grandstanding. Farmers, ranchers, food processors across this country are going to be bankrupt. They are desperate. They need people to stand up and show they are fighting for them, but unfortunately, time and time again the government has shown that it is not.</ParaText>

I wish that the government had sat down and had proper dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052485">I think about my riding. The member talked about the socio-economic impacts of what is happening to the farmers. I think about the Nuu-chah-nulth people who have been in court. The government spent $19 million on government lawyers fighting them for the right we know they have, the right they won in the Supreme Court of Canada, which the government appealed, not only once but twice. Their hands are up in the air, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052486">The member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation> talked about respect, which they call <I>iisaak</I>.

              <ParaText id="6052487">This is the problem. When we do not invest in meaningful reconciliation, what is the cost? I know what the cost is to the Nuu-chah-nulth people. It is suicide, unemployment rates and poverty. That is the cost. We have to fix this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052500">I want to acknowledge the comments of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> earlier today, and certainly acknowledge comments or other remarks from individuals in this place, looking to try to find solutions to this important question and consideration. I agree that good faith, partnership and a non-partisan approach have to take place when it comes to indigenous issues and pursuing true reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052501">I think about two basic questions that need to be asked. First, why are we in this situation? Second, what should be done?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052502">Why are we in this situation? Why are we seeing blockades and protests and economic disruption?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052503">The answer is pretty straightforward. It is because Canada, through successive governments, including the current government, has not done the basic work of resetting the foundations for relations with indigenous peoples, despite the rhetoric. We all know what needs to be done. We have known for decades, but we are here, yet again, in a moment of crisis, because this hard work has been punted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052504">The history of Canada saw indigenous peoples divided into smaller administrative groupings, with systems of government imposed upon them. For Indians, this was through the Indian Act and the creation of the band councils system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052505"> The work of decolonization, of reconciliation, requires supporting nations to rebuild, to come back together and revitalize their own systems of government, to self-determine. Until they do, we will never know who truly speaks for the nations, irrespective of the good work and good intentions of the hundreds of Indian Act chiefs and councils and traditional leaders, who, in many cases, are one and the same. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052506">However, we have not done this work. We have maintained the same legislation and policies for decades that keeps first nations under colonial statute, keeps nations divided, renders negotiations long and nearly impossible and does not support first nations nearly enough in doing the rebuilding work they must inevitably do. There are lots of reasons for this: the historical denial of rights to self-government and the denial to one's land and, so too, paternalism. The result of the perpetual inaction are situations like we see in Wet'suwet'en territory. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052507">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did say today that these problems had roots in a long history. That is true. However, let us be honest, and with respect, the Prime Minister has to learn to take responsibility. Canadians over many years have come to learn our true history and the need for fundamental change. He has been speaking for five years about this most important relationship. He stood in the House of Commons over two years ago and pledged to make transformative, legislative and policy reforms, reforms that would be directly relevant to the situation in Wet'suwet'en territory today, that would have supported the internal governance work of the nation, shifted the consultation processes that took place and provided a framework for better relations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052508">What have we have seen as a result of this speech, and its transformative words? Honestly, almost nothing. The promise of legislation has not come. I know it is hard, but we cannot keep punting the hard work because of political expediency. If we do, we will have another situation like we have today in five years from now or quite likely sooner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052509"> Therefore, here we are. What should be done? In the spirit of good faith and in the spirit of working together, may I be so bold as to offer four suggestions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052510">One, governments have to lead. They need to lead. Weeks have passed. If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants to have dialogue to resolve matters peacefully, de-escalate the situation and show real leadership, in my view he should have gotten on a plane, flown to British Columbia, picked the premier up on his way up to Wet'suwet'en territory and met with the leadership of the Wet'suwet'en and some of the broader indigenous leaders in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="40">(2340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052511">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could still do this, having regard for and respect for the wishes and preconditions perhaps of the Wet'suwet'en leaders and recognizing some of the challenges that exist in their community. Honestly, there is a practice of leaders not wanting, in my opinion, to be in meetings where the outcomes and structures are not basically predetermined. We have had enough of that. One cannot script dealing with real issues and challenges. Let us just deal with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052512">Two, the government should act now on making the fundamental changes that are long overdue. Long ago the government should have tabled comprehensive legislation that implements the minimum standards of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and upholds the recognition and implementation of indigenous rights, a recognition and implementation of rights framework. Such legislation would include supports, without interfering, for indigenous nations to rebuild their governments. It also would include pathways for moving out beyond the Indian Act. Indian Act chiefs have an important role to play in this process. Once truly self-governing, we will know with certainty who speaks for the indigenous title and rights holders. This is important not only for indigenous peoples to have faith in the legitimacy of their own democratic institutions but ultimately the people will choose and vote on their system of good governance. It is now also important for all Canadians to know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052513">I will be frank. The government uses language like “co-development” and the need to do it “in partnership” with indigenous peoples a lot, but a lot of the time it uses that language simply as an excuse to delay or justify inaction. For decades, at least since the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples 25 years ago, we have known the foundational legislative change that is needed. UNDRIP is a decade old. The government is five years old and it has been two years since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced legislation would be tabled within 10 months. Enough is enough. The time for action is now. No more half measures, no more lofty rhetoric, no more setting up interminable negotiations that get nowhere very slowly over years and years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052514">Three, I believe the government should consider a cooling-off period when construction activity does not take place. That would allow everyone to step back and assess where things are, clear the space for dialogue and de-escalate current tensions. Whether this period is for one month or for a few months, it can be of benefit to all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052515">In this time, dialogue between the Wet'suwet'en and the government can take place. As well, the Wet'suwet'en, in my respectful view, need to take responsibility in such a period of time to have, in a very inclusive manner, the internal dialogue needed to bring clarity about how they will approach the future of this project collectively. Also, such a period of time may allow for explorations, as there have been in the past, of alternative routing for small portions of the line that can address some concerns, including, if necessary, government roles in accommodating the costs of such changes, should they be adopted with broad support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052516">Four, as a proud indigenous person in this country, I know that indigenous governments also need to lead. The main request I have heard, including meetings with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and premier, is that the RCMP leave the area where it conducted enforcement activity. My understanding as of today is that the company and the Wet'suwet'en are both in the area and things remain currently peaceful. If the RCMP decides it is appropriate to leave, perhaps as part of a cooling-off period, then I would expect indigenous governments, including the Wet'suwet'en leadership, to take action, to look at reconciliation and to look at how they can move forward collectively. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052517">I want to make one last observation about reconciliation and the things that we have heard about reconciliation being dead. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052518">Reconciliation in its true meaning always involves a reckoning. With our past, we are taking responsibility with changing course in real ways, with making the hard choices for our future. These are the choices that every parliamentarian in this place representing their constituents has to make for the benefit of all Canadians. This is our opportunity to finally finish the unfinished business of Confederation and enable indigenous peoples to be self-determining, embrace the minimum standards of the United Nations declaration and finally ensure that indigenous peoples have their rightful place in this amazing country.</ParaText>

An agreement between the <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the premier and certainly involving the leadership and citizens of the Wet'suwet'en nation is important to determine the best way forward.

We have had inquiries about this, Ipperwash for one. This is a conversation that needs to continue, but appropriately with political action and agreement on all sides. Perhaps that would lead the way for decisions to be made by police and the RCMP.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6052530">Mr. Speaker, it has obviously been a difficult past 12 days for our country. I will be making my speech today from the perspective of transport, but I would like to preface my remarks by acknowledging that many of the issues we are struggling with go well beyond transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052531">As Canadians, whether we realize it or not, we inherit and benefit from the rich legacy of those who came before us, of the indigenous peoples who lived here from time immemorial, of the Europeans and others who came later and settled here, of all those who built the infrastructure and institutions that underline our present wealth and status as one of the most successful countries in human history, including the rail networks, ports, bridges and roads that continue to play a vital role in connecting our vast country from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052532"> However, in addition to inheriting this tremendously valuable legacy, we also inherited the mistakes and misdeeds of those who came before us. Much of our present good fortune came at the expense of indigenous people and communities who were displaced and had their lives and customs disrupted, some of whom we made treaties with, which were often violated either in word or spirit, and many of whom were forced into residential schools in an attempt at cultural assimilation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052533">We all live with the consequences of those decisions, the dual legacy of the accomplishments, the mistakes and the mistreatment. As a government and a country, we possess a better understanding today of those mistakes that were made in the past, the effects of which are still felt today and are reflective of things such as a lower quality of life for indigenous people or systemic challenges, including higher rates of incarceration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052534">We have embarked upon a long and difficult process of reconciliation. It presents many challenges, but it is also essential if we want to move forward and build a country that we can be more proud of. However, untangling some of those past mistakes and patterns is challenging. Many indigenous people in this country are angry over how their communities have been treated and are suspicious and mistrustful of the government, of our system of law and our police forces that enforce it, and not without some justification. To their credit, many non-indigenous Canadians sympathize with these feelings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052535">All this is to say, to repeat an earlier remark, that these issues raised by the protests we have been experiencing over the last 12 days go well beyond transport. They are complex and not easily resolved. They stir deep feelings of anger and resentment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052536"> It is easy to feel frustrated over the cost and inconvenience of these blockades and the protests that are causing them, but it is important to understand the reasons behind them. It is also essential to show compassion and understanding toward each other, to show some patience and take the time necessary to truly listen. We have to think about the people who are losing their jobs and seeing their lives disrupted as a result of the blockades, but we also have to think about those lives that have been impacted by a legacy of racism, neglect, marginalization and ignorance. What is called for at this moment is empathy, patience and cooler heads as we try to find a peaceful, negotiated solution. As the <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> has remarked, we have a choice in this country: We can either repeat some of the mistakes we have been making for hundreds of years or we can find a more peaceful path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052537">Let me turn to discussing some transportation aspects, with an emphasis on safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052538">The government feels very strongly about safety, especially around our rail transportation corridors. As a government, we have a duty to ensure that our rail system and its infrastructure are safe. We take that responsibility seriously. Our rail companies are also working to make their operations as safe as possible. Consequently, we are preoccupied with the recent activities in and around rail lines and rail yards across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052539">As the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> remarked last Friday, let us be clear that rail lines and rail yards are dangerous places for people without the proper training. Working in proximity to rail lines and railcars requires a complete awareness of safety procedures. Furthermore, large moving trains confronted with unexpected obstacles on a rail line cannot stop instantly. This presents an extreme hazard to the lives of those inside the train and in front of a moving train.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052540">I also want to remind Canadians that tampering with rail lines, railcars or signalling systems is illegal and extremely dangerous. In addition to putting themselves at risk, they are endangering rail workers and train passengers, as well as the living communities around them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="55">(2355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6052541">I would ask those who are violating the Railway Safety Act to consider the consequences should a serious accident occur, that injuries may kill innocent people. Will this advance the cause of reconciliation? Will it help indigenous people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052542">However sincerely the protesters hold their concerns, we cannot condone activity that deliberately obstructs rail operations. Therefore, I am calling on all Canadians to respect the Railway Safety Act and be conscious of the dangers associated with recent demonstrations. I know there are some who may perceive rail stoppages as something that only affects large companies' profitability. However, when rail services are disrupted we cannot overlook the impact on people's jobs, livelihoods and lives. We cannot overlook the impact of safe and efficient shipping of things such as propane and other fuels for heating homes, agriculture products, medical supplies, de-icing fluid at airports and so much more. These and other shipments are all sitting idle, unable to get to their destinations, because of obstructions on rail corridors. CN announced that blockages could force the rail company to shut down significant parts of its network. Hundreds of trains have been halted because of those blockages. VIA cancellations mean people cannot get to their homes or other destinations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052543">As I alluded to earlier in my remarks, there is no denying that there is a sense of alienation. There is no sense denying that there is a divide between us and different perspectives on an important issue. There is no denying that Canadians should have freedom to express their frustrations and concerns, but taking those frustrations and concerns to the country's vital rail network is dangerous. Livelihoods are at stake; lives are at stake. Canada is a trading nation, and our coastal inline ports are critical for both domestic and international trade.<ForceColumnBreak /></ParaText>
