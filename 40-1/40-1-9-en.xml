              <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Mr. Ted Menzies (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1249484">Mr. Speaker, as many have done before me in this new Parliament, I would first of all like to welcome all members and express my gratitude to my constituents for providing me the honour to serve them for another term. We all know that this is a job that carries great responsibilities and I am very honoured to be able to stand in this House and represent the great people of the riding of Macleod. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249485">I must once again remind all hon. members that I will argue with any member of this House that the riding of Macleod is one of the most beautiful ridings in this entire country. I am sure I have excited others to debate that, but we do have some of the most beautiful country. During the election campaign in the fall, I had the opportunity to travel around and visit most communities. We have about 25 different communities in that riding. I visited with a tremendous number of people and viewed some incredible scenery. I would invite all hon. colleagues to visit the beautiful riding of Macleod.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249486">I could not have accomplished this task without many volunteers, those who worked tirelessly, hours and hours on the phones, driving, door knocking, answering calls, answering questions, connecting constituents with me so I could talk with them on a one to one basis. Those volunteers are what make democracy work in this country and I give a great thank you to those people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249487">Also I do need to acknowledge the patience and understanding of my good wife, Sandy. It is only because of her support that I can be here to serve the constituents of Macleod. I thank her for her support. I also appreciate the support of my family, which actually got larger this summer. My son got married and now we have two new grandchildren. We now have a full family with a complement of four grandchildren, and of that we are very proud. I just wanted to share that with you, Mr. Speaker, because I know how important children are to you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249488">Let me continue with my speech now that we have recognized why we are here and how we all got here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249489">I am pleased to highlight the economic and fiscal statement that gave Canadians a clear update of the economic and fiscal situation. I might pause here for a moment to remind hon. members that this was not a budget. The budget will be coming early in 2009. The budget is where we lay out the projected incomes and projected expenditures for this government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249490">It seems to me that the opposition parties got their hopes high that there was going to be some spending that they could criticize, but there was not; in fact, we did not set that expectation. We said that we would bring Canadians up to date on where the economy is now, and we did that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249491">Here in Canada and around the world these are difficult times that require difficult choices. Our Conservative government has responded to this challenge by taking decisive action to restrain spending, to protect Canada's hard-won fiscal advantage and to reinforce the stability of our financial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249492">Today I would like to briefly review some of the statement's key measures and how they will help this country weather the period of global economic uncertainty. Let me begin by looking back for a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249493">Long before many countries responded to the deepening financial crisis, Canada acted early and decisively. No one could ever have predicted the rapid decline in world markets in the last several weeks. The scale is stunning in both its depth and breadth, and nowhere is that more evident than in the carnage we see among global financial institutions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249494">The jaw-dropping list of such institutions acquired, bailed out, converted, failed or nationalized in September and October alone demonstrates that. This list includes but is not limited to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, UBS, Lehman Brothers, the Royal Bank of Scotland, American International, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wachovia, Goldman Sachs, Washington Mutual, Fortis, a once very impressive list, but a troubling list now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249495">Our government was well aware that difficult times may be ahead when the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation> presented the 2007 economic statement. At that time we made choices to help put Canada in a stronger economic position, choices to lower the tax burden on Canadian families and on businesses in a significant way with pre-emptive and aggressive cuts from business, personal and consumption taxes, nearly $60 billion worth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249496">BMO economist Doug Porter noted earlier this year that the 2007 economic statement was “brilliantly timed. Just as the economy was running into serious heavy weather...we had some serious fiscal stimulant”. As the University of Toronto's Institute for Policy Analysis observed, “Helping offset the weakness in Canada will be 'fortuitous' injection of stimulus from the tax cuts...announced in the” 2007 economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249497">Clearly, we took decisive action long before other countries did. Indeed we saw the U.K. just this week take the action that we took last year, in reducing its consumption tax, the U.K. equivalent of the GST, which is the value added tax. Just this week the U.K. dropped the VAT by 1.5%. I note that the U.K. only dropped it temporarily, whereas we dropped 2% in our GST over a two year period permanently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249498">Why did the U.K. follow our lead? Listen to the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the U.K. just a few days ago when he announced these measures:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249499">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[W]e...need to take action to put money into the economy immediately.... [T]he best and fairest approach is a measure which will help everyone. To deliver a much-needed extra injection of spending into the economy right now. I therefore propose to cut VAT [the value added tax].... It will make goods and services cheaper and, by encouraging spending, will help stimulate growth.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249500">For the opposition members who have opposed, mocked and derided our GST cut, I ask them to reflect on those words. However, while our pre-emptive actions gave us an early advantage, these measures did not insulate us completely from the rest of the world. Unfortunately for all of us, global conditions have continued to deteriorate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249501">That is why, for example, we have had to take further extraordinary steps in the financial sector to respond to a global credit crunch that originated outside our border, yet which threatened to engulf us if we failed to act. And act we did. We acted to maintain the availability of longer term credit with the purchase of mortgage pools through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. This innovative measure is allowing Canadian financial institutions to continue lending to consumers, to homebuyers and businesses at an affordable cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249502">We also created the Canadian Lenders Assurance Facility. This offers insurance on a temporary basis on wholesale term borrowing by Canadian financial institutions. This backstop offered on a commercial basis, at no cost to taxpayers I might add, ensures that our financial institutions are not at a competitive disadvantage internationally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249503">Our recent measures have received widespread praise. As the <I>Globe and Mail</I> declared:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249504">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[U]nlike most jurisdictions, Canada is ensuring liquidity in financial services without taxpayers footing the bill.... [This] helps restore trust. It also encourages competition in financial services.... [I]t keeps Canadian financial institutions competitive with [their] global peers.... It doesn't involve billions of dollars in bailout money. It's just smart policy.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249505">We have also increased the borrowing authority of Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank of Canada to provide more lending choices for Canadian businesses. We announced new rules for government guaranteed mortgages this summer to prevent a U.S.-style housing bubble. These rules are in place today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249506">Faced with threats outside our borders, we answered with leadership from within. The result is ours is among the best fiscal positions of the G-7 countries. This fact is underlined by an OECD report released this week which showed that while global growth will be lower in the coming year, Canada will lead the way in the recovery with the strongest growth among G-7 countries in 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249507">Unfortunately, Canada is clearly not immune to the ongoing financial crisis nor to the weakening in the economy of the United States and elsewhere. That brings me to the economic and fiscal statement. Its measures build on a strong foundation of this government’s action over the last year and point the way to the additional activities we will take shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249508">Allow me to cite a few examples of its key initiatives, which focus on maintaining strong fiscal and financial management. The government is firmly committed to managing spending responsibly. For example, the economic and fiscal statement includes a commitment to eliminate the taxpayer subsidy for politicians and their parties. Political parties receive a generous amount of funding support from taxpayers, from reimbursements on election spending to tax credits to those who donate. We should not have our hands out for more, especially when times are tough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249509">As the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has pointed out, “We're in tough economic times, so this is exactly the place to start tightening the belt”. Indeed, if we are to ask for frugal expenditure management of public money, we must lead by example. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128481" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> said just this week, “I do think that ordinary Canadians are having a difficult time, so I think we should set an example and tighten our belts. I personally favour that, and I suspect most of my colleagues would, too”. We thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128481" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> for reflecting early on that this is a good move.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249510">My hon. colleagues should put the money where their mouths are and support this measure. In absence of that, it is clear the opposition has just been sweeping empty rhetoric about, showing little understanding of the plight of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249511">We are also pledging to ensure sustainable federal public sector wage rates and to modernize the pay equity regime. The government is committed to ensuring effective management of taxpayers’ dollars and is taking concrete action to keep spending growth on a sustainable track. As part of the new expenditure management system, the government is continuing strategic reviews of departmental spending. In the statement, we have recorded an estimated amount of savings from the round of reviews that is currently under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249512">I would like now to consider some of the statement’s provisions that address transfers to the provinces. The government is committed to ensuring the continued growth of federal transfers in a way that is fiscally responsible and yet sensitive to the volatile global economic environment. The equalization program will be adjusted within the principle-based structure set out in budget 2007 by putting it on a growth path that is in line with the growth of the economy. Major transfers will continue to grow. The Canada health transfer will grow at 6% a year and the Canada social transfer will grow at 3% a year. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249513">Across Canada, manufacturers and their employees have faced significant challenges in recent years. These challenges have been amplified by the turbulence in the financial markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249514">Make no mistake, the government will continue to implement its plan, “Advantage Canada”, particularly, our commitment to building a competitive advantage for Canadian businesses, including those in the manufacturing sector, and securing the prosperity of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249515">To that end the government will provide a total of $700 million in additional capital to Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank of Canada to expand their credit capacity by up to $3 billion, and to enable the introduction of new products to better serve the needs of Canadian businesses during a period of constrained credit availability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249516">In addition, going forward the government will continue to look at additional fiscal stimulus measures that would contribute to a more viable and competitive manufacturing sector. Canadian manufacturers and exporters heralded these announcements as, and I quote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249517">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--good measures...The government recognizes that liquidity is a major concern for manufacturers and exporters in every sector across Canada. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249518">Our Conservative government is also creating a competitive tax environment through broad-based tax reductions that support job creation, support growth, and support investment in all sectors of the economy, including manufacturing and processing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249519">In addition, tariffs on imported machinery and equipment would be eliminated as soon as possible in order to encourage capital investment and increase efficiency in our manufacturing sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249520">The government's actions in support of manufacturing will also benefit the automotive sector and in particular the automotive parts industry. For example, the government has committed to provide additional funding for the automotive innovation fund to support investments in the long-term viability of the automotive sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249521">We are also open to the possibility of providing further assistance to the automotive sector. The situation is fast moving. The <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> is engaged in discussions with the automotive companies and is monitoring developments in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249522">Seniors are understandably concerned about the impact of the sharp decline in markets on their retirement savings and in particular, their registered retirement income funds. We have listened and we have supported them in the past. We have supported seniors by raising the age limit for converting a registered retirement savings plan to a RRIF from the age of 69 to 71, which by the way, the House will recall from that particular vote that the Liberals and the NDP voted against that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249523">We are doing so again by addressing their concerns about the drop in the market value of their assets and their worries that their assets and RRIFs must be sold to meet withdrawal requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249524">In yesterday's statement, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> also proposed a one time change that would allow RRIF holders to reduce their required minimum withdrawal by 25% this tax year. That would mean that individuals otherwise required to withdraw $10,000 from their RRIF in 2008 would see that required withdrawal reduced to $7,500.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249525">Let me now turn to consider the statement's measures to accelerate infrastructure spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249526">In budget 2007 the government announced a seven year, $33 billion plan to boost Canada's public infrastructure. As a result, the amount of federal funding available to provinces, territories and municipalities for infrastructure projects is forecast to hit a record of $6 billion in 2009-10, double what was spent in 2007-08.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249527">We need to accelerate this activity. This would provide a significant stimulus to the economy and improve infrastructure that is vital to improving our long-term economic performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249528">We are working with the provinces and the territories to expedite infrastructure projects, and accelerate the uptake of federal funding as well as addressing regulatory and administrative barriers that slow down project implementation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249529">While the government has already taken major actions to strengthen and preserve the competitiveness of Canada's world-leading financial sector, this statement takes further measures, measures such as supporting the financial system in extraordinary circumstances, providing solvency funding relief for federally-regulated private pension plans, and enhancing credit availability through crown agencies for Canadian businesses affected by the global credit crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249530">In addition, the government will consult with provinces and Canadians to develop responses to short-term economic issues while continuing to implement its long-term economic plan. The immediate priorities are to accelerate infrastructure projects, improve opportunities for workers and sectors affected by current economic conditions, strengthen our world-leading financial system in line with our G-20 commitments, and improve the competitiveness of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249531">Since the earliest days of the global liquidity crunch, the government has taken important steps to strengthen the position of Canada's financial system, which is ranked among the soundest in the world. Our Conservative government stands ready to take whatever further action is necessary to protect the stability of the Canadian financial system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249532">Accordingly, we are proposing that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> be granted additional flexibility to support financial institutions and the financial system in any extraordinary circumstances. The proposed powers will include additional options for resolving difficulties in financial institutions should they arise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249533">The proposed powers are a continuation of the responsible leadership that the government has exercised to ensure that Canada's strong financial system is not put at a competitive disadvantage by developments in other countries. They are precautionary and intended as standby authorities that will bring Canada's regulatory tool kit in line with international best practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249534">The proposals are also in line with Canada's commitment to implement the G-7 and G-20 plans of action to stabilize financial markets and restore the flow of credit. The current global market crisis underlines the necessity of having a first rate financial sector regulatory framework, which includes a common securities regulator for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249535">Our current system of 13 regulators is far too cumbersome and unwieldy to provide the decisive, quick response that is often necessary. Indeed, in the words of a recent Montreal <I>Gazette</I> editorial:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249536">

              <ParaText id="1249537">The benefits of a common securities regulator will include greater efficiency, stronger enforcement and clearer accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249538">I see that my time is up. I had so many more positive things to say about the statement, but I appreciate that there are many other members on both sides of the House who want to stand and support this statement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249541">The same Douglas Porter so approvingly quoted from months ago by the parliamentary secretary is saying today that these measures yesterday are not what we need because they do not promote growth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249542">When the parliamentary secretary speaks of past measures to stimulate the economy, I could say the Liberal $100 billion tax cut of 2000 is still stimulating the economy or the measures of 2005 are stimulating the economy, but it is totally irrelevant because the issue is the economy today and the Canadian economy is in trouble today. The OECD says we will have a quarter of a million more unemployed Canadians in 2010 and yet the government did nothing, zero fiscal stimulus yesterday, and moved in the wrong direction through cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249543">Why is Canada almost unique in the world when other countries are stimulating their economies by tens or hundreds of billions of dollars? Why does the government think it is the right time at this moment of crisis to enact cuts?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249545">Speaking of changing one's mind, might I quote back to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128481" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, after the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in his year-end interviews warned Canadians that we were headed for some troubling economic times, that is leadership. We saw leadership in the fall economic update of last year with pre-emptive moves, and I will get back to that to address the hon. member's question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249546">However, when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> warned Canadians with great leadership capabilities, he was not trying to frighten Canadians as the opposition members are trying to do, gleefully gloating that we are losing jobs, gleefully gloating that other economies are in trouble. We should not take pleasure in economic turmoil around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249547">This government is trying to do its best to not frighten Canadians, but when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> publicly stated there will be some difficult economic times, let me read the quote from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128481" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249549">It is shocking. We all change our minds, even the hon. member. When the hon. member talks about economic stimulus I cannot help but think back to last fall's economic statement, when in fact the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> put in place measures that reduced Canadians' taxes by $31 billion this year alone. That is an incredible amount of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249550">However, let us put it in perspective. When the hon. member mentions that it is a pittance compared to other countries, the IMF is encouraging all countries to provide an economic stimulus of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2%. If we do the simple math, the $31 billion that we left in Canadians' pockets, that we did not take to bring to Ottawa as play money, March madness money that some of the former Liberal governments did. We left that in Canadians' pockets and let them decide what to do with it. That $31 billion is 2% of our gross domestic product. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249551">We did that a year ago and we would have loved to have the support of the opposition parties at that time but we also encourage them to support this. This is not a budget. The opposition should not misconstrue this to be a budget. I know it is disappointed. I know it is expecting spending that it could criticize. If we offered incentives to some industries, I am sure it would have found a way to criticize that too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249552">We will get to that, but as the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> stated in the House several times this week, we will not put money into an industry until we understand that is the best use of taxpayers' dollars, that it is coordinated with whatever our largest customer, that being the United States, is going to do in that same sector, or we could lose all those taxpayers' dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249553">I know it may not be that important to that side, but it is incredibly important to us. That is why we have put in measures to show leadership from this party. We are encouraging leadership from all members of the House to cut back on our spending: our spending as members of Parliament and our spending in our own budgets. In fact, we are planning on legislating caps on wage increases to the public sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249554">The <Affiliation DbId="105829" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> will speak to that later today in more detail. That is leadership. That is the kind of leadership that elected the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to lead this country.

              <ParaText id="1249555">Mr. Speaker, in his response earlier, the member opposite said that this was not a budget. But it is not an economic statement either. It is a smokescreen intended to hide this government's inaction and lack of consideration for the economic crisis we are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249556">Of course, at the beginning of the economic statement there is an overview of the situation throughout the world. However, when we dig deeper and read further into what the government is saying in the economic statement, through the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, there is nothing. This government said it was ready to listen to the opposition and to the Bloc's interesting proposals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249557">All week long, the government appeared to agree that the Bloc had a precise and costed action plan for developing wealth and vitality to support the forestry and manufacturing industries, workers, regions and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249558">There is nothing of that in this economic statement. There is nothing but Conservative ideology that wants to do away with any kind of opposition. It is clear: the government wants to muzzle the opposition parties, women and unions. That is what we see in this economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249559">My question for the member opposite is very simple. Can he explain why there is not a single concrete measure to support all the people who will be in need of assistance during this crisis? All the economies in the world have decided to implement a tough, clear economic plan, so that they can emerge from this economic crisis strong and thriving. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249560">Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the Bloc for some constructive suggestions. I do not think anybody promised that those would be in the economic update. I know the Bloc has not been in government. It takes a while to put these together. We certainly will take those into consideration when we develop the budget, and I again thank them for those comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249561">As I have said before in the House, I encourage all opposition members to put forward constructive suggestions. Members owe it to their constituents as their representatives to not just criticize, but to provide constructive criticism. We will accept that on this side of the House. We want to do what is right for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249562">I sense a need to go back and repeat what I said in my first answer, and I know the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128481" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> may have tuned me out as I spoke. We put a stimulus in place in the fall economic statement of 2007. The hon. member's question was about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249563">That economic stimulus was equivalent to 2% of our gross domestic product, which left $31 billion in tax cuts in the pockets of businesses and Canadians. That provided them the flexibility to buy a new home or buy a new car. A reflection of that is car sales are up in Canada this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249564">Canadians can choose what to do with their money more wisely than governments can. We tend to not respect, and I have sensed this many times in the House, how hard it is for taxpayers to earn that money. When we throw around numbers like we do and say that is only $30 million, only $30 million is a lot of money to Canadians, especially in difficult economic times. Therefore, we provided the stimulus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249565"> Not only that, opposition members suggest there is nothing in the statement that addresses any industry. I beg to differ. There are $350 million to Export Development Canada, which will leverage $4 billion to the auto industry for exporting automobiles. There are $350 million, as well, to the Business Development Bank of Canada to leverage its lending capacity to provide credit to Canadians. It is a liquidity issue and I wish the opposition would remember that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249568">Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure and honour for me to stand with the unequivocal opposition of all Liberals to the fiscal update of yesterday. We speak in one voice on this issue. It is entirely inadequate to the task at hand. I would characterize the fiscal update of yesterday with two simple words: it is pathetic and it is pernicious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249569">To give members some sense of where I am going, it is pathetic because it offers no stimulus. Canada, virtually alone, at a time of the worst crisis since the 1930s, offers nothing to help the economy, to help jobs, to help savers, to help people retain their pensions in their retirement years. It is pathetic in terms of a failed attempt to disguise the fact that the Conservatives are actually running a deficit. It is pernicious in its attacks on labour, on women and on the vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249570">Let me deal with each of these three points in turn.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1249571">As I just said, I feel that this economic and fiscal update is entirely inadequate. I am very pleased and proud that all Liberals will be voting against it. The fiscal update is pathetic because it offers no stimulating action by the government to help the economy. It is also pathetic as a failed attempt to disguise the fact that the Conservatives are actually running a deficit. And it is pernicious in ways that I will explain. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249572">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sometimes speaks like Roosevelt, but he acts like Calvin Coolidge or R.B. Bennett. He made some comments that we had understood the lessons of the 1930s. In Peru he said that under the extraordinary economic crisis in which we lived, we in Canada had a need for extraordinary fiscal stimulus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249573">He also said something with which I agree, and it is another important lesson from the 1930s, that the world must never descend into protectionism. Those are good words and I commend the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for them. The trouble is his actions are the opposite of his words. Rather than giving us extraordinary fiscal stimulus, which when he was in Peru he said was absolutely necessary, he has given us zero fiscal stimulus. He has given us even worse. He has given us cuts that he purports to be $6 billion next year. That is like negative fiscal stimulus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249574">When we look around the world, we see tens of billions of dollars of fiscal stimulus in the United Kingdom, in Japan and in the European Union. We see hundreds of billions of dollars of fiscal stimulus in the United States and in China. In Canada the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talks about the need for extraordinary fiscal stimulus and we see nothing at all, or worse than that we see cuts and no stimulus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249575">Does he not understand that the Canadian economy is on the edge of the worst crisis since the 1930s, that the OECD predicts we will have a quarter million more unemployed people between now and 2010? Does he think it is not important for the government to act to help those unemployed people, to help critical industries that are in deep trouble and require urgent attention, to help Canadian savers and pensioners who have deep concerns about the ability to live out their retirement in dignity? I could go on. There are so many things but he does nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249576">Let me deal with two of the government's excuses. He talks about past stimulus, but that is irrelevant. Other countries have given stimulus in the past. When we were the government, we gave fiscal stimulus in 2000 and 2005. The point is the world needs stimulus now. The fact that the government had some measures some years ago, obviously has not done the job or else we would not be in a so-called technical recession. We would not be heading for a quarter million more unemployed people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249577">Whatever the Conservative government did in the past, whatever our government did in the past in terms of tax reductions, is inadequate to the task at hand facing the economy of Canada today. That is why countries like Britain, the United States and virtually every country in the world understand that we are in this economic crisis and therefore have taken action. The Conservative government has taken zero action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249578">Why should we believe that the government will give us a major stimulus in February or March, or even late January? First, why did it wait? The sooner it acts, the better. President-elect Obama is not even in office yet and he has in place an economic plan. Other countries, and I have named them, China, Britain, France and Japan, have already acted. The Conservative government has been in office approximately three years, so it has had plenty of time to put forward action plans, yet it has done nothing and it tells us to wait two or three months and eventually it might get the job done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249579">On this question of pathetic in terms of lack of stimulus is I do not even believe, I cannot have confidence, that the government is serious when it tells Canadians it will offer fiscal stimulus early next year. It has shown by its mind-set, by its ideology this time around that it does not want to do anything. I do not believe that in its heart of hearts it wishes to stimulate the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249580">While the Conservatives talk like FDR, they act like those great depression leaders, R.B. Bennett and Calvin Coolidge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249581">My second point as to why this fiscal update is pathetic, is the government's pretext of balancing the books.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1249582">They claim that there is no deficit. However, as Jeffrey Simpson said in this morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, there isn't one economist in Canada who believes that there will be a surplus next year. No one can believe that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249583">There are at least two reasons why no one can believe it. First, their assumptions about economic growth are far too optimistic in comparison to what economists said a month or more ago. And the situation has changed for the worse since then. The government is saying that we will see modest growth next year, yet a recent OECD report said that growth will be a negative 0.5%, which makes a significant difference when it comes to a deficit. The government, as many economists have said, is being completely unrealistic and far too optimistic in its assumptions when it comes to Canada's future economic performance. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1249584">The second reason has to do with asset sales. This is an old Mike Harris trick. They have $10 billion over five years in asset sales, including $2.3 billion this year, but when we were in the lock-up yesterday and asked the finance officials for a list, they said there was no list. This is an old Mike Harris trick, and they were caught out in 2003 in Ontario when they were running on a balanced budget. They lost the election. Dalton McGuinty called in the auditor and found that in fact they were running a $7 billion deficit. Part of the reason for that deficit was fraudulent accounting on the subject of asset sales. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249585">The current <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> was from that same gang. I do not believe for one minute that he has confirmed asset sales of that magnitude. I think he just put his finger in the air and chose the number that would show a balanced budget. That is his number for asset sales.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249586">Let me make one other point on that subject. When we were in government, we did not record one penny in the budget of asset sales until we saw the money. We had to actually get the money before it was recorded in the budget as a sale. Not only has the government not received the money, it also does not even have a clue about which assets it plans to sell.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249587">For at least these two reasons, and there are many others, the pretense that the government is going to balance its books next year is totally without foundation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249588">Finally, the budget is pernicious. It is enough to be pathetic--pathetic is pretty bad--but if it is pathetic and pernicious, that is even worse. It is mean-spirited. Let me give just a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249589">The government needlessly attacked labour. Just days after public sector unions accepted a very modest wage settlement, the government felt the need to ban strikes in the public sector. Just days after the public sector union had accepted a multi-year wage settlement, why does the government have to ban strikes? One would do so only if one had a mean-spirited streak in one's thinking, which I think is characteristic of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249590">Why does the government have to attack women and pay equity? Again this is a mean-spirited, pernicious, ideological attack on the principle of pay equity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249591">The government also attacks the most vulnerable in our society. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1249592">It is an attack on the most vulnerable members of our society.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1249593">The attack on pay equity is an example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249594">The government has not told us what it is going to cut. It has told us it is going to cut a lot, but it has not told us what. We have to go on the Conservatives' record, and their record in the last Parliament was to make cuts in areas where people were most vulnerable, areas such as literacy programs, women's programs, and the court challenges program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249595">I can assure the House that we will be looking very attentively at where these cuts will be made. We have a suspicion they will be directed once again at the most vulnerable in Canadian society. I assure the House that we will be vigilant on that topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249596">Finally, we see other governments working in the spirit of solidarity with their opposition parties to tackle the world's worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Mr. McCain, who lost the election to Barack Obama, has met with Mr. Obama to ask how he can help to deal with the worst economic crisis in the United States since the 1930s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249597">Would we not expect our government to reach out to opposition parties in Canada's moment of economic crisis to see if we could not work together to produce a package that would help to support the Canadian economy at its moment of great difficulty?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249598">I would have thought that would happen. It happened in the U.S., and it is happening many other countries around the world. It would be normal to expect it from a normal government in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249599">The Conservative government has taken precisely the opposite approach through its attack on democracy and its attack on all the opposition political parties, just at the moment when parties need to work together for the good of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249600">I am proud to vote against this fiscal update. We Liberals speak with one voice when we believe something is not up to the task. This fiscal update is nowhere close to being up to the task of accomplishing what Canada needs as a result of our economic situation at this moment of danger and risk and uncertainty and potential crisis in the lives of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249601">The statement is pathetic because it does nothing to stimulate the economy. It crows about past actions, which are now irrelevant. Everyone around the world agrees that what is needed now is action. There is no action now. I for one find it hard to believe, given the government's ideological mindset, that it is serious in its promise to provide significant fiscal stimulus down the road. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249602">The statement is pathetic because every economist in the country knows that the Conservatives are not telling the truth when they claim a balanced budget. Even the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> yesterday virtually acknowledged that he was wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249603">The fiscal statement is not only pathetic; it is also pernicious in terms of its unwarranted attacks on labour, on women, and on vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249604">For all those reasons, the Liberal Party will speak with one voice, and proudly and definitely vote against this pathetic and pernicious fiscal update.</ParaText>

I might remind hon. members that this is a suggestion in the economic statement, and that is to reduce the required minimum withdrawal amounts from RRIFs by 25%, but I answer this with great concern because I understand the opposition may be voting against this. That is what seniors asked us to do. I would encourage all hon. members to respect that request.</ParaText>

There is currently a proposal under consideration to build one or two new bridges that would eventually link to a ring road around the national capital region and that would remove heavy truck traffic from the core. Every self-respecting city, particularly Canada's capital, should have a ring road for heavy truck traffic. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1249883">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128419" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249884">As this is my first speech in the House, I would like to acknowledge and thank all of the voters in the riding of Alfred-Pellan, who renewed their confidence in me during the most recent election. I would also like to thank those who have given their time and energy to the Bloc Québécois team to raise awareness of our ideas and our priorities. I would have been so proud to have seen their efforts result in a plan to bring some much-needed stimulus to the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249885">I believed that the Conservative government, with the support of the opposition parties, would have offered Quebeckers and Canadians solutions to help people and businesses deal with this global crisis that, some say, will be worse than anything we have seen since the Great Depression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249886">Every other government on the planet is taking steps to deal with the crisis by stimulating the economy, but this government has given us a partisan, ideological statement that has a lot in common with the Reform Party's far-right agenda, a right-wing ideology that has blinded the government to the importance of acting now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249887">Instead of breathing life into the economy, which desperately needs help, the Conservative government has chosen to stifle it. It has left businesses, regions, and by extension, the entire population, high and dry. We cannot accept that. My party and I condemn the fact that, instead of tackling the economic crisis, the Conservative government has chosen to create a crisis of democracy for strictly partisan reasons by eliminating funding for political parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249888">In the current economic situation, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should have given workers a helping hand, but instead he decided to attack their interests by suspending their right to strike. He also continued his campaign to erode the status of women by making pay equity a right henceforth to be negotiated in the collective bargaining process but without compensating for the fact that the fundamental right to strike is being eliminated. In the hope of more readily imposing his ideology, the Prime Minister wishes to muzzle the political parties, the unions and women. In short, he wants to muzzle all opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249889">Although they said they were prepared to work with the opposition parties, the Conservatives rejected the proposals in the economic recovery plan presented this week by the Bloc Québécois. These were realistic proposals that met the needs created by the current economic crisis. The federal government has the responsibility to take action at the juncture of this economic crisis. Furthermore, Ottawa has the means to do so without increasing debt servicing or creating recurring deficits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249890">The Bloc Québécois put forward a recovery plan to help businesses and the general population, a three-part plan that could have made a significant contribution by injecting some $23 billion into the economy. The plan we presented this week was realistic and it could have been implemented to help Quebeckers and Canadians protect what they have and to stimulate their industries and the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249891">This plan included immediate measures that cost nothing. Some of the measures not retained were: adopting legislation on the government's preferential procurement practices; regulations requiring federal organizations to use forestry products in federal construction projects; abolishing the two-week waiting period for employment insurance benefits; reinstating funding for economic development organizations; reinstating cultural programs; the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and credits for non-polluting industries, particularly in Quebec; raising to 73 the age for converting an RRSP to a RRIF. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249892">Our plan also includes measures for businesses. For example: a $4 billion modernization fund to stimulate investment in manufacturing companies and increase productivity; a comprehensive plan to support the manufacturing and forestry sectors; a $2 billion development fund for affordable housing using CMHC assets; and a $2 billion fund for home energy efficiency renovations, also using CHMC funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249893">We have also proposed measures to help people directly, such as full compliance with the equalization formula; an additional $1.3 billion transfer for post-secondary education; an incremental increase in the guaranteed income supplement; graduated retroactivity for those eligible for the guaranteed income supplement who were swindled by the government; improved access to the employment insurance fund; an income support program for older workers; and a $4,000 rebate program for the purchase of electric, hybrid or fuel-efficient vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249894">As I said earlier, the government has sufficient means to fund this kind of economic stimulus package. Funding can come from a strategy to reduce the use of tax havens for tax evasion. We also recommend that tax breaks for oil companies be cancelled. Ottawa's financial assets, which total $176 billion, will also be called upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249895">Instead of showing Quebec and Canada its true Reform Party colours with its right-wing economic statement, the federal government could have put forward measures, some of which would not cost a penny, to help the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249896">That is what the Bloc Québécois proposed to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> just days ago. Our economic stimulus plan is realistic and strong, and it shows that we can act to stimulate the economy and give businesses and individuals the tools they need to deal with the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249897">The Bloc Québécois will vote against the Harper government's ideological economic statement because it attacks democracy, workers and women, while doing nothing to stimulate the economy. The Conservatives have chosen provocation over cooperation, but the people do not want an election. </ParaText>

Obviously, one way to make a quick contribution to this country's economic development would be to use the surplus accumulated by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, or CMHC, which amounts to about $8 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249910">The government should quickly implement a plan for affordable housing, which is desperately needed across the country. I have had feedback in my riding, where people have to go on a waiting list before they can get affordable housing. Since the government coffers already have a surplus, this would have no effect on the budget. This immediate action would be appropriate to respond to the economic crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249914">Mr. Speaker, the wording of the Conservative member's question is a very good reflection of his party's philosophy: always be cautious, maintain a balanced budget, but all the while ignore the crisis we are currently experiencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249915">But a government needs to be close to its people to realize that they are experiencing difficulties. Many of them are losing their jobs. Seniors' incomes are decreasing, because their assets, their pension plans, are consistently decreasing. They do not know how they will survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249916">The government's job now is to invest in the economy, and later, when the economy has improved, the government can focus on a balanced budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249917">As for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, it has an existing surplus that is not being used. We are not talking about the government creating an additional expense in the current budget. We are talking about the government using the surplus instead of letting it sit there as their ideological safety net, saying that there is a huge $8 billion surplus, and it will stay there as protection, but all the while, people need housing. Building more affordable housing would stimulate the economy.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1249918">Mr. Speaker, as I rise today to speak to the economic statement, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of <Affiliation DbId="128419" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation> for putting their trust in me for the second time in the recent election. The people of <Affiliation DbId="128419" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation> voted 50.1% for me, which is a powerful motivator. I am happy about that, and I would like to thank them and tell them that I intend to continue the work I have been doing in my riding and in the House of Commons since 2006 with the same passion, the same thoroughness and the same determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249919">In the same vein, I would be remiss if I did not also thank all the people who worked on my campaign. I want to tell them that I owe this victory essentially to them, because of all the time and energy they put into the campaign. I extend my thanks to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249920">I would like to speak to the economic statement delivered in this House yesterday by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. Many things have already been said about this statement. I listened carefully to the speech by the <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. Now, I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues and share my reactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249921">On listening to the speech by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the first thing I sensed was a great deal of provocation, pure and simple. There was the Conservatives' usual arrogance, along with the confrontational attitude we have seen before. The Conservatives had promised to be more conciliatory and to work with the opposition. Yet at the first opportunity, what they gave us was pure provocation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249922">We can see that this government has no concept of the political reality in which it has found itself since 2006. I believe the Conservatives do not understand how they fared in the election in Quebec and that they are turning a deaf ear to the message from the voters. The people have just barely given the government a second minority. Obviously, they do not want an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249923">Since this is a time for compromise, openness and action, I cannot understand the attitude of the government, which has presented us with an economic statement that is very surprising, but unacceptable. The Conservative government, which had again said that it was prepared to work with the opposition parties, has—I would say deliberately—provoked all the opposition parties in this House since this session began.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249924">Rather than tackling the economic crisis, the Conservative government decided to invent a democratic crisis—for reasons that are purely and strictly partisan, truth be told—by eliminating funding for political parties, knowing full well that this measure hurts third political parties in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249925">The government is claiming that it wants to save $27 million. And yet it did not hesitate to call an election that cost $300 million when voters did not want an election. Furthermore, this government broke its own law by calling an election for reasons that, I believe, were purely partisan. It just does not make sense. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he wanted to call an election to be in a better position to manage the crisis. After calling an election and returning to power, the first thing he does is to again throw this House into a democratic crisis. He is not really doing anything to deal with the economic crisis and has not put forward a concrete plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249926">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should have given workers a hand, but he decided instead to attack their rights by suspending the right to strike. As a woman, I am particularly affected by the attack against women in making pay equity subject to negotiation. I was very surprised, in today's question period, to note the silence of the <Affiliation DbId="128714" Type="4">Minister of State (Status of Women)</Affiliation> who did not raise an eyebrow or express her disapproval, as a woman, of her government's position on pay equity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249927">This comes in addition to other actions by a government trying to obtain absolute power by attacking all opposing points of view, anything that does not suit its ideology, anything that does not match its world view and anyone who opposes it. It wants to silence them. Consider the media. It is no secret to anyone, and the government was highly criticized for it. We also know that it tried to block the work of parliamentary committees. It even attacked the credibility of the Chief Electoral Officer in the in and out scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249928">It also attacked the Auditor General by asking her to submit her press releases to the Prime Minister's Office for approval. It also attacked civil society groups that dared to take legal action against the government for some of its actions such as eliminating the court challenges program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249929"> I would also remind the House that during the election campaign, the government announced unfathomable and unacceptable cuts to artists, and despite unanimous consensus in Quebec, it has maintained those cuts. The <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> at the time promised during the election campaign that the programs would be replaced, but we know very well that this is false, since the new <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage </Affiliation> reiterated in this House that there was no way he would reverse his decision regarding programs to promote Canadian artists on the world stage to expand Quebec culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249930">Clearly, this is a question of ideology. This economic update contains no economic or administrative decisions, only ideological decisions. The Conservative government is using this twisted method to impose its ideology more easily. It is using the economic update to silence political parties, unions and women, in short, to silence any form of opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249931">When I was debating with the Conservative candidate in my riding during the election campaign, I was able to see how much contempt the Conservatives have for workers and unions. I was debating with him about having empathy for people who lose their jobs, and about the fact that we must offer them what they need to get through this crisis. I felt the same way during my debate with the Conservative candidate as I did when I heard the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> scoff at workers' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249932">We can see the logical progression, and that these decisions are purely ideological. Instead of presenting a plan to stimulate the economy and give it a boost, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went for measures that will stifle the economy. While all the governments in the world—this came up a lot today—are taking action to counter the crisis, the Conservative government is doing the exact opposite. The federal government did not get the job done. It did not do what it could have done when it comes to measures to help people and businesses through the financial crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249933">The only measure put in place to help individuals is a temporary reduction in RRIF minimum withdrawals. That is a step forward, but is it not nearly enough compared to what the Bloc Québécois has proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249934">We have been saying this for a week already. The Bloc Québécois proposed a series of measures to help individuals through the crisis. We would like the government to listen to us and implement the measures we proposed, not in a few months or a few weeks, but to implement these measures now to counter the economic crisis and help individuals and businesses through this difficult crisis. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249936">As we know, the federal government has had a law governing the funding of political parties since January 1, 2004. This was a first, since, prior to that, money just fell from the sky and landed in secret slush funds. This was a big step for Canadian democracy. That law was inspired by similar legislation adopted in Quebec in 1977, under the René Lévesque government. The new legislation ensured equilibrium among the parties, so that there would be some degree of uniformity or equality in terms of political party representation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249937">The current proposal upsets this equilibrium in which the limitation on political party fundraising was balanced by appropriate and uniform funding provided by the government to all political parties. This would reverse existing legislation. We see this as an attack on democracy.</ParaText>

It seems as though the Conservative government thinks that people are completely lacking in intelligence. But their intention is clear: they want to put an end to a democratic practice that protected us from wrongdoing or fraud in political party funding, as has happened in the past. It is a purely partisan move. And the Bloc member is not the only one saying it. This opinion is shared by Quebec, by the opposition parties and was expressed in national newspapers today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249941">I would like to add that when the <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> gave his speech, he said that the opposition “got their hopes high” in terms of seeing concrete measures in the economic update and that they have no reason to be disappointed.

              <ParaText id="1249948">When I stated in the House a couple of days ago that I could not support the Speech from the Throne, I did so because the throne speech laid out an agenda for this Parliament that completely ignored the concerns of hard-working Canadians in this time of unprecedented economic uncertainty. It did not address their fears about lost jobs, lost pension benefits, lost EI benefits and lost savings. As an agenda for economic recovery, the throne speech was a lost cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249949">The right-wing hecklers on the government side tried to shout us down. They said that a detailed economic plan would be inappropriate in a throne speech. They said that we should wait until Thursday, when the economic update would be tabled. That would be the time for action on the economy, they said. That would be the time for bold strategic measures that would offer hope to Canadians. That would be the time, they led us to believe, that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> would morph into a northern Obama, vigourously attacking the economic crisis and protecting Canadian families from its ravages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249950">Yesterday the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation>attacked all right, but instead of attacking the recession, he attacked democracy, he attacked workers, he attacked women and he attacked seniors. Of all of those attacks, his attack on democracy, I suspect, is perhaps the least sexy for those watching this debate on television this afternoon. After all, party financing is insider baseball and hardly tops most Canadians' list of concerns, so let me dispose of that one quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249951">Jean Chrétien knew the Liberal Party was hugely dependent on donations from large corporations to finance that party's election campaigns. In fact, 80% of the party's financial support came from Canadian companies, not individual supporters. To kneecap his successor, Paul Martin, he made corporate donations illegal. All parties would now have to raise money without the support of corporate and union donations, and individual donations were capped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249952">As partial compensation, he implemented instead a system whereby each party would get $1.75 annually per vote garnered in the most recent election. This is the subsidy that the economic update suggests will be cut as of April 1, 2009. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249953">I can see eyes glaze over all over the country as I discuss this item, so let me just say this: as a proposed measure of fiscal responsibility, it amounts to one-twentieth of 1% of just the increase in the government's overall spending since it took office in 2006. It has nothing to do with attacking the economic crisis. It has everything to do with implementing the strategy of Conservative adviser Tom Flanagan, who said in his book, “The path to Conservative political dominance is to financially bankrupt your opponents”. It was an out-and-out partisan attack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249954">The same is true of the government's attack on workers. At a time when Canadians are deeply worried about the future of the their jobs, the government's sole response was to propose a ban on the right to strike for public sector workers. That measure is completely unconstitutional and therefore serves no purpose other than signalling the government's intent to attack workers instead of helping them through this difficult economic time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249955">Leaders in countries around the world are taking bold steps to invest in the economy and to protect and create jobs. They are offering a 21st century version of the New Deal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249956">Here in Canada, we got no deal at all. There was no new infrastructure spending that could have helped workers, suppliers and communities. There was no mention of a stimulus package for transforming the auto sector. There was no investment in the new energy economy. There was no mention of innovation or of research and development. There was not a word about addressing the need for more workers in health care, aged care or child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249957">The job creation package Canadians so desperately need is nowhere to be found in this update. To add insult to injury, there is not even an investment in restoring the social safety net, and this precisely at the time when Canadians most need it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249958">In the manufacturing sector alone, we have lost over 350,000 jobs since the government came to power. As I said during question period the other day, EI claims in Ontario are up 14%. Claims are up 30% in Windsor and a staggering 96.4% in the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s own backyard of Oshawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249959">Ontarians are urgently looking for reform of the EI system. On average, they get $4,600 less a year than workers get in other parts of the country, yet the economic update does nothing to make EI more equitable or more accessible for workers who have lost their jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249960">EI is an essential part of poverty prevention. The government's silence on this cornerstone of our social safety net is a direct attack on the very people who have paid into this system all their working lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249961">Some of those people, of course, are now pensioners, and they are profoundly worried about their retirement savings.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249962">The economic update announced a 25% reduction in the amount of mandated minimum registered retirement income fund withdrawals, and, to be fair, that is at least a step in the right direction. However, for seniors who have watched their retirement savings disappear before their eyes, a moratorium on mandatory withdrawals would have gone much further in dealing with the anxiety that they are feeling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249963">Other pension measures are even more disturbing. The government announced that it is planning to allow pension plans under federal jurisdiction to double the length of time required for solvency payments from 5 to 10 years. The conditions are that companies must have the agreement of pension plan members and retirees by the end of the year 2009 or they must secure a letter of credit to cover the five-year difference to protect pensioners. That is certainly good news for companies but is it really good for members of the pension plan?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249964">I will cast it in this light. The way the system works now, if an employer under funds the pension plan and uses that money for other corporate expenditures, retirees and other beneficiaries of that plan, in essence, become financiers of the company. They lend companies money for their business. However, unlike other financiers of the company who lend money, they did not get to make a decision about whether they wanted to take on that risk and, in these uncertain economic times, I very much doubt that it is a risk that most beneficiaries would be willing to assume.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249965">If the government were serious about wanting to support workers instead of attacking them, it would have replaced its vague language on proposed “consultations on issues facing defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans” with strong language on the need to work with labour, business and other levels of government to discuss mechanisms, like a pension insurance fund. Or, it could have adopted provisions of the very first bill that I introduced in the House after being elected in 2006, the workers first bill, which would have given workers' pensions super priority in cases of commercial bankruptcy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249966">The primary focus of pension reform must be to protect the pensions of workers but that, of course, is not what we find in this economic update. What we do find, however, is yet another attack on women. It eliminates the ability to make pay equity claims retroactive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249967">In the most inflammatory language, the government suggests that pay equity is a problem because it is inherently litigious and adversarial. It goes on to say:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249969">This is yet another direct attack on the hard-fought gains by Canadian women and it is an attack that is driven purely by the right-wing ideology of the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249970">The stage for this was set in the last Parliament. The Conservatives then cut funding to Status of Women. They cut funding for the court challenges program. They cut funding for the arts. They even cut funding for children's literacy. This had nothing to do with fiscal responsibility. It was an ideologically-driven attack on programs that supported the most disadvantaged in our society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249971">Canadians deserve more from their government and Canadians need more from their government. They need to know that the government shares their worry about their jobs, their pensions, their savings and their homes. </ParaText>

They need a bold plan, strategic investments in our ailing economy and economic stimulus now but, inexplicably, the economic update does not deliver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249973">The vote that I am casting on that update next week is not a vote that I am casting for myself. I will be casting it for the seniors and hard-working families in my riding who sent me to Ottawa to fight for them. They are under attack and I will not take it sitting down. I have stood up for them in my community and I have stood up for them in the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1249976">She indicated that when she votes next week, as she put it, against the economic and fiscal update, she will be voting on behalf of seniors. She should be aware, and I hope she is, that when we vote Monday on the ways and means motion to implement certain provisions from budget 2008, which I think was passed last February or March, which was a long time ago, by a previous Parliament, and certain provisions from the economic and fiscal update, those provisions will have to do with taxation measures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249977">Many of those taxation measures deal directly with seniors, the very people she says that she wants to help, measures like RRIFs and the reduction in the amount they must pull out of their RRIFs. That measure will help them considerably. She should be aware that and that is what is contained in the ways and means motion that we will be voting on.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1249989">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the House today in response to the economic and fiscal update that we heard yesterday. I am very proud to be here as a re-elected member for the constituents of Vancouver East. My community is largely a low-income community and I know people were listening to the economic and fiscal update yesterday. They were very eager to hear whether the government was getting it, whether it had heard the message from ordinary people across the country about how they were hurting, the jobs being lost and how families were struggling week by week and month by month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249990">Sitting in the House yesterday and listening to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, I must say that I had a sense of anger. The emails and calls I have received from my community tell me that people were not only disappointed but angry that the Conservative government failed to respond in a moment of urgent need to the needs of average people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249991">What we saw yesterday instead was an attack on the rights of working people and on our political democracy. When we go through the statement and look at it line by line, we see immediately that what is glaringly absent is a program for the strong economic stimulus that is required in this country. One only has to look at the global situation and what has happened in the last few months to feel the anxiety that people have about what is unfolding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249992">This is a time when people expect their government to show leadership. When we look at the international community and see what other countries are doing, it is very evident that they are understanding that a serious and substantive investment as an economic stimulus is the centrepiece of any economic program that needs to be put forward. However, here in the House yesterday we saw none of that. What we saw instead was an attack on people's rights and an undermining of the programs we have had in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249993">I particularly wanted to hear any message or indication that the housing crisis in Vancouver would be addressed. In the city of Vancouver, there is, in effect, a zero vacancy rate. People are paying 60%, 70% and even 80% of their income for housing, if they can find it. We have seen housing that is being demolished or converted. We have seen thousands of low-income units lost in the Downtown eastside. We have seen renters in the west end, on the eastside, all over the city who are scrambling to survive, to find their most basic need, which is the right to shelter, security and housing. What better example could there be for an economic stimulus and investment in our economy and yet the government was silent on this matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249994">I want to remind the government that back in 2007, the inner-city inclusivity table for VANOC, the Olympics, came up with a report that was a collaboration between businesses, the city, the province, the local community and civil society. They determined that the city of Vancouver needed 3,200 units by 2010 to deal with the crisis that was already there in 2007. Not one step has been taken to deal with that urgent recommendation made in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249995">We know from the most recent homelessness count done in metro Vancouver that homelessness has increased by 22%. We know that the aboriginal population is most at risk for homelessness. In fact, aboriginal homelessness has increased by 30% over 2005. Although aboriginals only comprise 2% of the population, they comprise 32% of the region’s homeless population. These are staggering statistics. They speak to a society that has become deeply divided due to public policy and policies of the Conservatives and prior governments that have eroded basic programs, affecting the ability to get EI, the opportunity to have safe and secure housing and to have a decent job.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1249996">Those factors were already place. It is now being accelerated and deepened and turned into an even greater crisis because of what has happened with the world-wide financial credit crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249997">What we heard yesterday was a slap in the face to Canadians. It was an insult to see the minister come forward with a program to eliminate strikes in the public sector and the roll-back of collective agreements. This is just sheer folly. Ideology is leading the government rather than programs, supports and measures to help workers and average families wherever they might be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249998">Surely the government must be aware that in 2007 the Supreme Court of Canada struck down British Columbia's Bill 29, which Gordon Campbell tried to do exactly the same thing. He rolled back collective agreements and wages in the health care sector. Those collective agreements were torn up. Thankfully those unions brought forward a challenge to the courts and it went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. The ruling from the Supreme Court said in essence that workers had the right to bargain collectively as part of their freedom to associate and that the right to free collective bargaining was protected by freedom of association in Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1249999">This is clearly being said by PSAC, the Public Service Alliance of Canada, as it now lives in fear of losing its very environment and rights, which have been established over many decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250000">As my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> said earlier, not only is there an attack on the rights of workers by undermining the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike, but there is a double jeopardy, and that is an attack on women's equality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250001">What right does the government have to abandon all the work that has been done on pay equity? Every union member has the right to file a grievance. The union has a right to file a complaint about pay equity issues and it has the right to deal with it through the collective bargaining process. For the government to take that on and to use this economic crisis as an opportunity to attack those worker rights as though somehow we would not notice or somehow it would slip it through, is incredibly appalling. It is unconscionable and it is a real revelation and indication of the government's agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250002">Yesterday, we had an economic and fiscal update that did not give any concrete significant economic stimulus to help those families in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250003"> Another thing we listened for was whether there would be any reform for the EI system. What kind of insurance scheme do we have when workers and employers have paid into it, but two-thirds of people do not even qualify any more? What happens to those workers when they are thrown out of their jobs or they are laid off because of the worsening economic situation? One would think they would be able to rely, at least as a basic source of security and income, on an employment insurance system that should be there when they need it. Even that system has been gutted over the years. We have said loud and clear in the House that the EI system must be reformed. There must be money put into that system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250004">We know $50 billion-plus have been created as surpluses in that system, but they have not been ploughed back in to help workers with retraining, with assistance when they have been laid off, or whatever their circumstances have been. This is a travesty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250005">I am very proud to say that the members of the NDP are standing up as a united caucus. We will be voting against the economic and fiscal update and the ways and means motion on Monday. We understand the devastation it will bring. We understand it completely missed the mark in helping the people who need it. It is an ideological attack put forward by the government on democracy, on workers and on women. It has failed the people who are in need and therefore we will not support it.</ParaText>

Would the member comment on the rationale contained at page 52 of the document presented by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, where it states “an asset purchased in the 1950s may no longer be relevant to the core responsibilities of the Government more than 50 years later?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250015">Second, the government says that it would employ a considered approach, taking into account the condition of the markets to make sure a fair value could be achieved for these assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250016">In a down in the economy, in a buyer's market, does the member think that any of these assets will be sold and if so, does she think there will be any fair market value?

              <ParaText id="1250017">Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising this point because it is hard to cover everything in 10 minutes. This was one issue I did want to get to. Again, what we have seen with the economic update is the government trying to manoeuvre and manipulate and slip in some programs that it has always wanted, like selling off public buildings, which are owned by the people of Canada. It is using the rationale of the economic recession before us to get that through and hope that nobody notices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250018">I agree with the member. The idea that the government will get fair market value for these valuable properties, which have an immense public value, in today's market is ludicrous. Any real estate agent or any expert on real estate will tell us that this is the worst time to do that. Why would we sell off these valuable assets when they should be kept for the benefit of the people of Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250019">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in debate today on the fall economic fiscal update. My comments will be fairly narrowly focused. I think some of my other colleagues have addressed and will address the broader issue of the economic stimulus that our government has taken in the past year and also address red herrings that members of the opposition have raised in respect to the sale of assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250020">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has been very clear that there will not be any fire sale of the assets belonging to the Canadian public. However, as we know, the opposition today is more concerned about protecting their own privileges in respect of their financing of political parties rather than engaging in any meaningful debate, so they are bringing up these various red herrings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250021">Millions of Canadians are aware that we are entering difficult times. There is a deep sense of concern across the country about the economy and as a result, Canadians are making hard decisions to ensure they are ready for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250022">Yesterday we heard the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> tell Canadians that we would take concrete action to ensure responsible fiscal management and effective government. As part of our commitment to employees and to taxpayers, I look forward to legislation that will ensure equitable compensation in the public service. This will bring long overdue reform to our complaint-based pay equity regime, which has proven to be a lengthy, costly and adversarial process, a process that does not serve employees or the employer well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250023">We are fortunate in our country. We have one of the most dedicated and professional public services in the world. The federal public service is one of the best places to work for men and for women, with competitive salaries and a full range of family-friendly benefits. It is worth noting that in 1983 fewer than 5% of women were in senior management positions. Today women make up 41% of the senior and executive ranks of the federal public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250024">Our government is proud to be leading the way when it comes to recruitment and compensation of employees. The time is right to put in place a more modern approach to ensuring fair wages for all employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250025">We need to take action to put an end to the long and drawn out court cases of the past. Many Canadians would be surprised to know that the last court ruling on pay equity was in 1999, at a cost of $3.2 billion to taxpayers, a settlement that took a gruelling 15 years to achieve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250026">Before I continue any further, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250027">Public service employees deserve better. Taxpayers deserve better. Next week our government will put a better, more modern system into place to ensure equitable compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250028">First, our approach will be proactive. Employers will be required to proactively ensure wages are fair and equitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250029">Second, it will be timely. Issues will be resolved as they arise within the collective bargaining process instead of through lengthy legal proceedings. I should point out that this is a natural extension of the employer's duty to bargain in good faith and the union's duty of fair representation to all of its members. It will be fair. All employees will have full recourse to address any complaints.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250038">We should all be encouraged by developments in the past two weeks. The Public Service Alliance of Canada, the country's biggest federal public sector union, has resolved two pay equity complaints through a negotiated settlement with our government. This was an outstanding complaint that arose over the last number of years before our government came into office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250039">The fact that we were able to come up with a negotiated settlement is another strong sign that it makes real sense to move forward with a more modern approach to equitable compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250040">Moving to an approach that is based on collaboration with bargaining agents rather than the current adversarial process would ensure pay equity issues are addressed as they arise and that problems are resolved quickly.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1250063">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today to debate the economic and fiscal update.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250064">Canadians understand that there are certain sectors of the Canadian economy that have been more severely impacted than others by the global credit crisis, including the manufacturing sector in this country that has deep roots in the U.S. economic system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250065">The manufacturing sector is of great importance to our Canadian economy. Faced with global economic uncertainties, many industries are undergoing considerable transition as they respond to global pressures. The tightening of international credit, a slowing U.S. economy, volatility of energy prices, and the dollar: these are serious challenges with which industry is faced in this current economic climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250066">Unlike the opposition which ignored the problem for the last three years, our government acted quickly to provide effective assistance to this sector. From the moment Canadians voted for change, we stepped up to the plate and demonstrated leadership to ensure that this country has the right business climate so that our industries can be more productive, more innovative and secure jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250067">Everyone agrees the manufacturing sector has to become more modern, more efficient and more productive. Some of these adjustments will be difficult, but they are necessary for the long-term competitiveness of this sector and of Canada's economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250068">The success of manufacturing in Canada will increasingly be determined by the ability of our industries to make adjustments in their production capabilities, to respond to and capitalize on new global realities, including the need to innovate, be more competitive and participate in global value chains. Today this message becomes ever more important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250069">This government has taken action to help. We are working to ensure that Canadian businesses affected by current circumstances have access to capital to help support their success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250070">We developed a plan to purchase $75 billion in insured mortgage pools by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, therefore freeing up much needed credit to help these manufacturers have access to finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250071">Furthermore, we have increased the borrowing authority limit for the Business Development Bank of Canada from $9.7 billion to $11.5 billion, ensuring that the BDC has the necessary flexibility to assist small and medium size business in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250072">By approving a $2 billion increase in Export Development Canada's borrowing authority, our government is ensuring that companies have access to the financing they need to continue to grow, innovate and take advantage of business opportunities in Canada and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250073">I am very proud that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced yesterday in the economic and fiscal update that our government is providing EDC with an additional $350 million in capital to support up to about $1.5 billion in increased credit capacity for those most affected by the current financial crisis. EDC will now be able to add nearly $80 billion in exports and investments it helps to make possible for Canadian enterprises, including $4 billion for the auto sector alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250074">We are also providing BDC with an additional $350 million in capital so that it can increase its credit capacity by about $1.5 billion for term lending activities, and a new time limited facility providing guarantees to financial institutions for their lines of credit for viable small and medium size businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250075">These are concrete and effective measures that will make a real impact on the manufacturing sector. They were applauded yesterday by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters which stated that the economic update “gave Canada's manufacturing and exporting sectors much needed oxygen and short-term breathing room”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250076">I am very disappointed that the opposition wants to vote against these important measures supported by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. It is typical of the opposition to put its own self-interests ahead of the interests of Canadian families, workers and business, but I cannot understand how it is that the opposition can disapprove of these measures which are so vital to our manufacturing sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250077">It is important to note that these actions are part of a much larger series of measures that this government has taken since 2006, important measures that the opposition has consistently voted against. We acted much earlier, and for those industries and workers affected by the changing economic circumstances, we introduced the $1 billion community development trust to support our communities affected by economic difficulties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250078">We are assisting older workers in vulnerable communities through the targeted initiative for older workers, TIOW. For the TIOW, we have extended funding to a total of $160 million over five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250079"> We are working to provide over $9 billion in tax relief for manufacturers and processors. I repeat, that is $9 billion in tax relief for manufacturers and processors. I did not say banks and energy; I said $9 billion in tax relief for manufacturers and processors. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1250080">This includes broad-based tax reductions and increasing for three additional years the temporary accelerated capital cost allowance on the investments in machinery and equipment. We have improved the scientific research and experimental development tax credit program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250081">Let me put this in context and emphasize the impact these measures are having on stimulating the Canadian economy. Actions taken by this government mean that in 2009 Canadians and Canadian businesses will pay $31 billion less in taxes as a result of the tax cuts we have introduced since 2006. That is just in 2009. Canadians will pay $31 billion less in taxes. That is equivalent to about 2% of Canada's GDP and it is permanent structural relief. It is not some flash in the pan, throw some money at it, see if it sticks, we do not know if it will work. That is what the opposition proposes. We propose permanent structural stimulus for the Canadian economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250082">We have shown that working on sound economic management, tax relief and strategic investments will help the Canadian industry weather current economic uncertainties and remain competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250083">What the government will never do is write a blank cheque, as the opposition advocates. Canadians have grown tired of short-term and ineffective policies of the Liberals and others. Our government is working with the manufacturing sector to ensure the plan is in place that will ensure the innovation and long-term sustainability of the sector and at the same time provide value for money for hard earned taxpayers' dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250084">Our government continues to take action to create the conditions necessary for business success. Through the measures introduced in recent budgets, combined with the government's long-term economic plan, “Advantage Canada”, the government will deliver on its commitment to help companies in the communities in which they reside to both innovate and succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250085">Our actions will help all sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, the automotive and the forestry sectors. We will indeed take specific steps to respond to specific challenges in specific industries. By providing this long-term foundation, we will provide a stronger economy for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250086">We must keep our eye on the future. Canada will weather this economic storm and we will come out stronger, more innovative, more competitive, and sooner than any other G-7 nation.</ParaText>

This is the eighth general election that I have participated in. I have almost got it down. Elections are not my favourite. Campaigning is not my favourite.

I have a great deal of respect for this place and I have a great deal of respect for all the members here who were successful, and those who also ran but were not sufficiently appreciated. Our democracy is worth protecting. This is our system. This is the way it should work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250111">In the election, I made the promise to my constituents, and I want to share it with the House, to continue to work hard and to use my best judgment in a professional and responsible manner. That is the only promise that I made to my constituents, because if we conducted ourselves in this place in a professional and responsible manner, the public perception of our profession would increase enormously. We would be held in higher esteem. We need to work harder on this. I know it seems to have been lost, this idea of bringing more order and decorum, more professionalism, more responsibility, more maturity to this place, but we do have to work harder, even in the light of severe challenges that are facing our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250112">Earlier this day, the <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> confirmed that the<Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, during his year-end address last year, cautioned Canadians about the impending financial crisis. It has been known for a long time. Most of us would have received newsletters from investment houses reminding us about what happens when there are corrections in the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250113">I thought it was interesting that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, despite the clear evidence, continued to say during the election that our banks are strong, that everything is going to be fine. Well, I understand politics and I understand that is what one says. But that same denial continues even today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250114"> In the economic statement yesterday, there were budget forecasts which were looking at .3% growth in GDP in 2009-10, when virtually every private sector economic forecaster, the OECD, all had more pessimistic projections for that period. Why? Because it would allow them, by having more generous projections for the GDP growth rates, to show a minuscule surplus in the fiscal year in which we are currently in that ends next March, and a small deficit in the following year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250115">It is deceiving Canadians and I know it is because in the last Parliament we set up, under the accountability act, the Parliamentary Budget Officer. That Parliamentary Budget Officer is independent. That Parliamentary Budget Officer has access to all of the information from the finance department, everything that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250116">So, when I looked at the releases, et cetera, it was clear. The Parliamentary Budget Officer came out and said, sorry, but all of the fiscal problems that Canada is experiencing right now have nothing to do with the global economic crisis; they have to do with, and are solely as a consequence of, the actions of the Conservative government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250117">The erosion of the tax base, irresponsible spending and the raising of some $50 billion more in spending makes it the biggest spending government in the history of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250118">That is how it has squandered a $12 billion surplus. It is also reflective of the fact that the Liberal government had a contingency reserve. It basically meant that once we got down to a $3 billion surplus, there was no more money to spend and it needed to be saved in the event that serious unanticipated issues beyond our control came up, such as SARS or BSE. That is why it was there. Otherwise it was going to pay down debt. If we do not pay down debt in the good times, we are not going to pay down debt when we are in an economic crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250119">It was clear. The Parliamentary Budget Officer said, “My goodness, I do not know what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is talking about. We have the same numbers but I know that the economic projections are not as rosy as presented to the Canadian people” and indeed in the economic statement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250123">It is fascinating that the Conservatives put it in and now it has been taken out. Why has it been taken out? Because it has nothing to do with addressing the economic challenges that our country is facing. It was a political stunt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250124">We did not even talk about that yesterday. When we were in this place, when we asked questions and gave speeches, we were talking about the principal issue and that is that the economic statement and the commitments of the government basically said, “Do not even consider it. We are not having any economic stimulus until, at the earliest, the budget next year”. Why? Because the government wants to wait and see if people really need help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250125">Do we wait until people lose their jobs before providing an economic stimulus to save them? Is that the way it works? I am sorry. Every major industrialized country in the world facing the same challenges has brought forward immediately a significant economic stimulus package to protect jobs, to protect pensions, to protect the savings of its citizens and to give them hope. The government gave Canadians no hope yesterday. The government gave them no prospects of any relief whatsoever. They were told to fend for themselves, keep what they have and not to depend on the government, that the government has no role to play in the lives of people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250126">We know what is going to happen. We have been through economic downturns before. We know what happens when people lose their jobs and when interest rates skyrocket. We know what happens when inflation gets out of control. People lose jobs. There is a ripple effect on businesses, individuals, families, crime rates, health care costs and social program costs. Pick the subject matter. It is impacted by an economic downturn, by a crisis.</ParaText>

Regardless of whether the Conservatives have wording on political funding in the economic statement, that was never the issue.

With respect to any spending initiatives that we put in place or any tax cuts we made for businesses, families or individuals across the country, what have we done that the Liberals would have opposed or would have reversed if they were on the government side of the House?</ParaText>

I understand that income splitting is important, but when we have limited dollars, they should be targeted to those most in need. However, if we take out all the seniors who do not have a partner and all the senior couples who are in the same tax bracket anyway, only 12% to 14% of seniors will benefit, and they will be those earning the highest incomes as seniors in Canada. They are not the ones who are most in need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250145">Mr. Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claimed that he wanted a new mandate because he needed to deal with the economy. That is what he told Canadians when he decided to call an election. By the way, it was an illegal election since he broke his own law and then usurped the powers of Parliament. In a parliamentary structure a minority government usually falls because of a vote of non-confidence in it and then there is an election. Parliament was not even sitting at the time he called the election, so a vote of non-confidence could not have happened. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> usurped the powers of Parliament and broke his own law. From the start we see the kind of respect he has for Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250146">After the election the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that we would have a different House of Commons. He said that he would be more collaborative with the opposition. He said there would be a different tone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250147">We saw that tone last night, a tone which is the same as before. Basically it has come back with a vengeance. It is a bullying tone, one of “my way or the highway”. There is no collaboration. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is totally ignoring the fact that this is a minority Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250148">One minister said this morning that he never heard Canadians say that they actually wanted a minority government. Therefore, he does not acknowledge there is one because he does not acknowledge what Canadians are saying or how they vote. The Conservatives discount the democratic process in this country altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250149">In yesterday's statement women in this country were again being attacked. Is it not bad enough that the government and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did this in the very first budget they brought into the House? I will get to that in a moment. Let us look at some of the facts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250150">Women earn on average only $37,000 compared to men who earn on average $70,000. Women earn only 70¢ for every dollar that men earn. Women provide 80% of the caregiving for children and family members. Therefore, they are in and out of the labour force which costs them a great deal in terms of promotions, income and pension buildup over a lifetime. They are therefore poorer when they become seniors and usually are more vulnerable to economic downturns. They are more vulnerable as a whole. Because of this a large number of women need affordable housing, but they are not getting it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250151">Child care is gone. Most women cannot go to work without a proper quality child care program. One of the first things the Conservatives did was cancel the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250152">There is no minister for women in this country. I was at a press conference recently where a member said that she was the first minister responsible for the status of women. She claimed she had no other portfolio, which was not true, but nonetheless she said that. The House leader said in the House that the size of cabinet has not been increased because some individuals are just secretaries of state. I thought they sat around the cabinet table. They go to cabinet meetings and they have an increased salary and extra staff. This was reiterated by another Conservative member in answer to a question. We do not have a minister. Today in the House she was not allowed to answer any questions on the issue. We do not have a minister responsible for the status of women in this country. Maybe the minister, if she is a minister, should resign and give her salary back to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250153">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> might want to consider that women would like to have a minister to look after their issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250154">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has an agenda. He knows exactly what he has wanted to do from the start. His first objective when he came to power was to strip the cupboard bare and spend all the money. That is what Harris did in Ontario. When there is no money left in the cupboard, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will say that there is no money so services have to be cut. Who pays the price when services are cut? The people who need the services the most: women and seniors. Housing and infrastructure programs suffer as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250155">This has been a specific determined approach by the Conservative government from day one. Right off the bat, as soon as they got here, the Conservatives started to cut programs for the most vulnerable. They cut the literacy programs. How many wealthy people need literacy programs? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250156">The Conservatives took the word “equality” out of women's equality, which is counter to the Constitution of Canada and the Charter of Rights, which says that women are equal. However, that is not happening so we need a program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250157">The government says that child care is not needed and that women do not need it to go to work. During the election I met a woman in my riding who broke down and cried in front of me because she could not afford child care. This was a woman from a middle-income family, with a home, a mortgage and a couple of children and she was spending about $1,300 per child on child care. She could not afford that amount but could not find a space elsewhere. No spaces were available. She broke down because her choice was to leave her job, which she did not want to do because she needed the income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250158">I know of another woman who had to leave her job and her partnership position, which meant she was lowering her income, to stay at home with her ailing mother. She had to somehow become self-employed. This goes back to women providing care and losing economic power. These women have no housing and no child care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250159">When we talk about infrastructure for the cities, the government has been talking about $33 billion for a long time but I have not seen a cheque go to the cities. The $33 billion, by the way, is not even real because, if we break it down, only about $1.5 billion are actually from the government. The rest of the money was there from the previous Liberal government. The Conservatives just keep recycling it and re-announcing it all over the place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250160">Where are women in this country? Nowhere. They do not exist, not as far as the government is concerned. In fact, it is doing everything possible to bury them further and hurt them as much as it can. I do not understand what the problem is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250161">We know that emptying the cupboard and cutting services was the government's objective from the start. It was not a secret. It happens constantly with all the budgets that have come through here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250162">However, the Conservatives did not get the majority they wanted in the last election. I truly believe the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants another election because he thinks that if he goes to the people and tells them how bad everybody else is and how badly he needs it now in order to put the economy back on track that he could get his majority, which would then give him the power to do as he likes with the country, with women and with social programs where he can tear down, take apart, leave the cupboards bare and make the cuts that he so badly wants to make. He has even started to politicize the judiciary. He has voted non-confidence in Elections Canada in the House. He has started breaking down our systems, our democratic structures, but he cannot finish the job and do it well because he does not have the majority that he wants. He has people like us objecting and getting in the way all the time. He needs an election so we are not in the way anymore and he can do what he really wants to do to the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250163">He called an election because he wanted the majority so badly. He had no platform. He never said what he would do. He only introduced his platform in the very last couple of days, after the debate, because people were asking where it was. However, it said none of the things that he is doing now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250164">As I said earlier, he broke the law and usurped the powers of Parliament all because he wanted this fabulous majority to do as he wanted. Now he is trying to force another election because he does not want to invest in Canadians. He could do it. Nothing prevents the government from coming forward with an economic plan that would address our economic downturn and deal with the crises that this country is facing and will face. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250165">I have seen other prime ministers in the past do it. Lester Pearson, one of our most famous prime ministers, brought major reforms to this country in two minority governments, major social reforms that we still enjoy today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250166">However, the present government does not want to do that because it is not interested in co-operating nor in building. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants his majority so he can actually tear down. Right now nothing prevents the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from coming into the House with a proper economic plan and proper programs to help Canadians who are losing their jobs or are about to lose their jobs, to help women and to invest in research, health, technology, green jobs, into anything.

There are many things that we need to do for women, certainly maintain the pay equity but also with respect to EI. EI has been reviewed a number of times.

              <ParaText id="1250179">Women are most disadvantaged with respect to EI at the moment. Therefore, it does need to be reformed. It does need to be expanded to include and assist women who are losing jobs and will be hit hardest by the economic downturn. Self-employed people, for instance, are not part of EI at the moment, and they should be. Many of them are women. EI needs to be reviewed and needs to be changed.

              <ParaText id="1250186">It is a pleasure to rise today in the debate on our government’s economic fiscal update. The world is experiencing an unforeseen and unprecedented global economic slowdown. As a result, Canadians are making hard decisions to ensure that they are ready for the future. They are making hard decisions to ensure that they will have the money to pay for their children’s education and for their own retirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250187">This government is also making some hard decisions to keep its house in order so that these tough economic times shall pass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250188">On Thursday, we heard the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> tell Canadians that we are taking concrete action to ensure responsible fiscal management and effective government. This action includes measures to keep spending under control and focused, as well as measures to modernize our institutions and the way they do business. Canadians expect no less from their government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250189">As part of this commitment, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced that our government will be introducing legislation to ensure predictability in federal public sector compensation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250190">In this country we are fortunate in having one of the best public services in the world. Public servants work in more than 200 federal organizations. They work in dozens of different occupations, from border guards to food inspectors and from public health specialists to diplomats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250191">It is important to remember that public servants are paid by the Canadian taxpayer. It is important that the government lead by example and tighten its own belt before it expects Canadians to do the same. That is why our government will introduce legislation to ensure that public sector compensation remains reasonable and affordable. This legislation would put in place annual public service wage increases of 2.3% for 2007-08 and 1.5% for the following three years. Our government is ensuring that pay for the public sector grows in line with what taxpayers can afford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250192">This restraint will apply to all public sector employees, including members of Parliament, senators, cabinet ministers and senior public servants. Our government is also ensuring equitable compensation in the public service. This will bring much-needed reform to our complaint-based pay equity regime, which has proved to be a lengthy, costly and adversarial process that serves neither employees nor employers well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250193">We should be especially proud of the progress toward greater gender balance in the public service, particularly within senior ranks. It is worth noting that back in 1983, fewer than 5% of women were in senior management positions. Today women make up 41% of senior and executive ranks of the federal public service. Women are taking their rightful place in the federal public service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250194">They are not only taking on top jobs, but their representation in many groups has also increased dramatically over the years. For example, women now represent nearly 60% of knowledge workers. They also represent about 50% of the economist group and 40% of the commerce officers group. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250195">It is safe to say that over the past two years, there has been a significant change in Canada’s public service, and women have played a big role in that change. Today, the public service provides women and men with equal access to all positions and with identical wages within the same groups and levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250196">I am proud of the example we are setting for both private and public sector organizations around the world. I am aware that the situation is not perfect, but remarkable progress has been made in addressing the wage gap between men and women in the federal public service. Since 1999, the difference between total wages for men and total wages for women has been decreasing steadily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250197">Given this situation, and given the need to ensure that the strides women have made in the federal public sector continue to be maintained, the time is right to put in place a more modern approach to pay equity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1250198">We need to take action to put an end to the long and drawn out court cases of the past. It is worth recalling that the last court ruling on pay equity was in 1999 and at a cost of about $3.2 billion, a settlement that took a gruelling 15 years to achieve. We cannot afford any more repeat performances like that. Public service employees deserve better. Taxpayers deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250199">Next week the government will table legislation that will ensure such court cases will become a thing of the past. The legislation is important and I encourage every member of the House to support it. We need to move on. We need to replace the existing complaints-based pay equity regime that has left us with a lengthy, costly, adversarial process, a process that does not take into account the realities of the new Canadian labour market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250200">I note with encouragement the developments over the past two weeks, which has seen the Public Service Alliance of Canada, the country's biggest federal public sector union, withdraw two pay equity complaints through a negotiated settlement with the government. The fact that we are able to come to a negotiated settlement on two important pay equity complaints is another strong sign that the time is right to move forward with a more modern approach to equitable compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250201">Moving to an approach that is based on collaboration with bargaining agents rather than the current adversarial process will ensure pay equity issues are addressed as they arise and that problems are resolved expeditiously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250202">The legislation the government will introduce will give us a more modern and collaborative approach. It will help us rid the current system, which is archaic, onerous and just plain unfair to employees. However, all these important measures are already being threatened by an opposition that is more interested in lining its own pockets than by leading by example. Just as Canadian families and businesses are doing, the government should show prudence and restraint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250203">In this global economic instability, supporting the legislation is the right thing to do. It is what Canadians expect. Most important, it will ensure prudent and responsible use of tax dollars and it will protect the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. It will ensure that women and men continue to benefit from quality working conditions in Canada's public service.</ParaText>

Having some knowledge of some of the costs of litigation, lawyers tend to work, at least in the smaller communities I live in, for about $100 to $150 an hour. I suspect when we get to the levels in the litigation process we are talking about, we are talking about hundreds of dollars an hour. Over 15 years, my guess is this cost a heck of a lot of dollars.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250215">In my previous occupation I had occasion to work with many women who received equal compensation for equal work. That was right and that was fair. In fact, in my speech I referred to some of the top positions in the federal civil service. I believe over 40% are now occupied by women. Yes, we should be aiming for 50% to 51%. It should be equal, and we are moving to that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250220">In the throne speech, which the House passed yesterday evening, we sketched a broad outline of our strategy to protect the financial security of Canadian families and businesses during this period of global economic instability. Our program is very objective. Fiscal restraint and good government are just two ways we can support our economy during these uncertain times. We have committed to ensuring responsible spending during this fiscal year and those to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250223">The current economic situation has also heightened Canadians' appreciate for what is required. They see that we need a fiscally responsible government and a competitive economy to protect our families and our communities. They expect us to be prudent in spending their tax dollars and they are looking for us to deliver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250224">Canadians understand the need for belt-tightening in tough economic times. They see that taking a responsible approach to public sector compensation is even more critical during a time of economic uncertainty and tight fiscal circumstances. They understand that this economic crisis, which has come to us from beyond our shores, will require sacrifices close to home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250225">As part of our government's plan to stabilize the economy, we have said that grants, contributions, capital, wages and other operating expenses all will be placed under the microscope of responsible spending. Indeed, we have delivered.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250226">Last week, in response to a question I asked, the President of the Treasury Board announced that we had reached an agreement in principle on compensation with the Public Service Alliance of Canada, which represents over 100,000 federal public service employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250227">Shortly after that, we reached two compensation agreements with the Canadian Association of Professional Employees, one for the translation group and the other for the economics group. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250228">All of these agreements include pay increases of 6.8% over four years, which is reasonable during these difficult times. These agreements are in line with our financial framework and our policies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1250230">However, given the urgent need to ensure predictability in public sector compensation overall, it is reasonable and responsible for the government to consider all options in order to achieve this. We need as much predictability in our compensation structure as possible during the current uncertainty. That is why we will be tabling legislation to set future increases in rates of pay in the public sector. By this, I mean the entire federal public sector, senior public servants and parliamentarians included. This means us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1250231">This legislation will control increases in rates of pay across the federal public service and limit the growth of the public sector payroll. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250232">We are demonstrating clarity and foresight by adopting this approach to government payroll management. Taken together, these agreements in principle and our legislation are examples of responsible outcomes in public sector compensation. They are fair to employees and affordable for Canadian taxpayers. They will serve Canada well as we face uncertain economic times.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1250233">This approach is about sharing the load. It is about balancing recognition for our highly respected public sector employees and the valuable jobs they do to serve Canadians from coast to coast to coast. The government understands the significant contribution that these employees make every day to the high quality of life in our families, in our communities, and so do I.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1250234">Our approach to controlling the growth of public sector compensation is about making the government more effective by spending responsibly on the right priorities. It is about practising restraint, just like any household would do in tough economic times, and reaping the rewards later. It is about compensation that is fair to employees and fair to taxpayers. That is good for the government, good for taxpayers and good for Canada.</ParaText>

Where is the investment for affordable housing? Where is the investment for child care? Where is the investment for education? All these factors affect the well-being of women and all Canadians, and we see nothing from the government.</ParaText>
