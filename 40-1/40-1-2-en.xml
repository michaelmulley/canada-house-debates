              <ParaText id="1242591"> Mr. Speaker, it is a long-standing parliamentary tradition for the Prime Minister to present pro forma legislation that asserts the right of the House of Commons to present legislation and, following in the practices adopted in some legislatures and in some of our provincial assemblies, I am proposing today to actually table an actual document that asserts that right.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1242592">Mr. Speaker, dealing with Bill C-1 in the proceedings at the opening of a Parliament is largely a symbolic gesture, as described in Marleau and Montpetit, to assert Parliament's right to act as it sees fit quite apart from what may or may not be in any Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242593">Unfortunately, with the gesture the Prime Minister is making, there was no preliminary consultation with the opposition parties about what the government had in mind. We spent a good portion of the day yesterday talking about the importance of consultation, inclusion and reaching out to all members of the House to involve them in the proper procedures of this place to try to establish a better atmosphere and a more conducive feeling among members to work together on important topics of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242594">While the process that the Prime Minister is now proposing may not change anything in substance, I would on this occasion like to ask for two things. First, the assurance of the Prime Minister and, indeed, from the Chair, that this gesture does not change anything in substance since we have not had any opportunity to be consulted in advance or to examine the precedents that might exist in the provinces. I would like that assurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242595">Second, I ask for the general assurance of the House, in the spirit of goodwill trying to make this place work better for all of us, that there is a sincere effort made at advance notice and consultation so this kind of awkward point does not need to arise again.</ParaText>

Two hundred and fifty years ago, on October 2, 1758, the first parliamentary assembly of its kind in Canada was held in Nova Scotia. It is worth solemnly remembering in this Chamber the historic significance of that event.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242608">Because today, we are free to reach our full potential thanks to the efforts of women and men, young and old, who established democracy in this country, where anything is possible.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242609">This country is made up of every hope we cherish, every dream we pursue, every project we realize.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242610">Upholding the ideal of democracy that we embody in the world is a responsibility that each of us bears.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242611">As the great-great-granddaughter of slaves, I know just how precious this legacy is to the citizens of this country. They have again and again expressed their pride in this legacy to me, through their words and deeds, over the past three years.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242612">In these uncertain economic times, it is more important than ever that our spirit of solidarity prevails and reaches beyond our borders, so that Canada represents not only a hope of renewal, but also a promise for the future.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242613">Today, in this democratic tradition, the representatives of the Canadian people gather for the 40th time in this great nation’s history to open a new federal Parliament.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242614">For over 140 years, since the era of Queen Victoria, Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-Etienne Cartier and the other Fathers of Confederation, the Parliament of Canada has assembled to deliberate upon the great issues of the day.  

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242615">This institution thus represents one of the longest and most unblemished records of peaceful, democratic self-government anywhere on Earth.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242616">The people spoke once again in a general election on October 14th, and entrusted this Government with a renewed and strengthened mandate. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242617">At the same time, the people also chose to elect a minority Parliament. And in a parliamentary democracy such as ours, the government must always be responsible and accountable to the people’s representatives.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242618">Our Government is mindful of both the privilege and the responsibility with which we have been entrusted.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242619">This is a time of extraordinary global economic challenge and uncertainty. The world’s financial system faces pressures not seen for many generations. Governments around the world have taken unprecedented steps to restore confidence in the face of a global economic slowdown.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242620">As Canadians watch these developments unfold, they rightly wonder about what they might mean here at home, for their jobs, their savings and their families’ well-being. Canadians know that, as Canada is a trading nation in the global economy, these events—while originating outside our borders—will nevertheless reverberate here.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242621">In the face of this uncertainty, just as when faced with difficulties before, Canadians will prevail.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242622">Canada was founded on the belief that, by joining our strength in confederation, our united country would be able to meet and rise above any challenge set before us.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242623">From the explorers and pioneers to the settlers and railroad builders, this vast country was built by people who took tremendous risks and braved unforgiving elements for the prospect of a better future.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242624">The dawn of a new century saw new challenges. In a war that ended ninety years ago last week, our young country came of age on battlefields whose names echo across our history—Ypres, Vimy, Passchendaele. The generation that followed overcame the Depression and again confronted the devastation of war. The achievements of these generations are marked not only by monuments to their bravery and sacrifices, but also by their legacy in forging Canada as one of the most peaceful and prosperous nations on Earth. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242625">We know that Canadians will face the problems of today with the same spirit of determination and resolve as those who came before us faced the challenges of their generation. And like them, we know that we will emerge stronger than ever.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242626">In this time of global economic instability, we can be reassured that the hard work of millions of Canadians has laid a solid foundation for our country. We have pursued policies different from those of many of our trading partners. We have paid down debt and kept spending under control. We have set public pensions on a sound footing and refinanced important programs such as health care and post-secondary education. Our banks are among the strongest and best regulated in the world. Canadian households and businesses have been prudent and avoided taking on the excessive debt witnessed elsewhere.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242627">Embarking on its renewed mandate, our Government is committed to providing the strong leadership that Canadians expect. It will protect Canadians in difficult times. It will work with Canadians to secure our future prosperity. It will support Canadian workers and businesses in their pursuit of a better future. And our Government will continue its pursuit of distinctly Canadian policies that will contribute to a better economy.  

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242628">Our Government has a clear approach to Canada’s economic security. It will work with its partners to help address the current international crisis. It will maintain a prudent course for the country’s finances. It will take action to support the economy today while building a stronger economy for the future.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242629">As our Government dedicates its efforts over the months ahead to supporting the Canadian economy, so too does it rededicate itself to working in partnership with others to achieve this goal. Canadians expect federal and provincial governments to work together to steer us through the current economic turmoil and, ultimately, build a stronger Canada. To this end, First Ministers met on November 10th and will meet again in the new year.

</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242631">The first order of business must be to put the international financial system on a sounder footing. Just as these troubles began beyond our borders, so will their solution demand that Canada engage its partners and allies around the world.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242632">Canada will use its experience in developing a strong model of financial regulation to help lead the world in the repair and strengthening of the international financial system. The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance began this important work on November 15th, joining the leaders of the G20 in Washington, D.C., to re-examine and renew the rules and institutions that underpin the global financial system.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242633">The financial sector exists to serve the economy. Without sound financial institutions, loans would not be available for home ownership. Businesses would be cut off from the credit needed to expand and hire new workers. By choking off financing to the global economy, the credit crisis has dramatically weakened the prospects of growth. Canada will play a leading role to help resolve the crisis, maintain free and open markets, and advance Canada’s interests.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242634">The credit crisis has also underlined the dangers of a fragmented financial regulatory system. To further strengthen financial oversight in Canada, our Government will work with the provinces to put in place a common securities regulator.

</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242636">Canada’s relative success in weathering the global economic turmoil thus far can be attributed in no small measure to our country’s solid fiscal fundamentals, the best among all major industrialized countries.

          <ParaText id="1242637">A strong fiscal foundation is not an end in itself, but it is the bedrock on which a resilient economy is built. Responsible budgets, significant debt repayment, and declining corporate and personal income taxes have provided an important competitive advantage. As Canada navigates today’s economic uncertainties, it is even more important that we keep our sights fixed on responsible fiscal management.

          <ParaText id="1242639">Ongoing, unsustainable deficits are quite rightly unacceptable to Canadians. These structural deficits must never return. At the same time, in a historic global downturn, it would be misguided to commit to a balanced budget in the short term at any cost, because that cost would ultimately be borne by Canadian families.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242640">Hard decisions will be needed to keep federal spending under control and focused on results. Grants, contributions and capital expenditures will be placed under the microscope of responsible spending. Departments will have the funding they need to deliver essential programs and services, and no more. Our Government will engage Parliament and encourage members to take a more active role in scrutinizing spending and suggesting areas for restraint.

Our Government will strengthen Canada’s workforce for the future by continuing to support student financial assistance and taking measures to encourage skilled trades and apprenticeships. Our Government will also work with the provinces to make the recognition of foreign credentials a priority, attract top international students to Canada and increase the uptake of immigrant settlement programs.

          <ParaText id="1242651">Canada’s traditional industries, such as fisheries, mining and forestry, sustain the economic well-being of many regions and communities. Our Government will continue to assist these industries through measures aimed at marketing Canadian products abroad and helping businesses to innovate.

As one of our greatest hockey legends has observed, we need “to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.”

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242656">Building a more dynamic economy will require new ideas and new investment. Our Government understands that advances in science and technology are essential to strengthen the competitiveness of Canada’s economy. Our Government will start at home, working with industry to apply the best Canadian scientific and technological know-how to create innovative business solutions. It will invest in new world-class research facilities. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242657">Our Government will also expand the opportunities for Canadian firms to benefit from foreign investment and knowledge, while taking steps to safeguard consumers and our national security. Our Government will proceed with legislation to modernize our competition and investment laws, implementing many of the recommendations of the Competition Policy Review Panel.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242658">Cultural creativity and innovation are vital not only to a lively Canadian cultural life, but also to Canada’s economic future. Our Government will proceed with legislation to modernize Canada’s copyright laws and ensure stronger protection for intellectual property.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242659">Both investment and trade matter to Canada’s prosperity. Our Government is committed to seeking out new opportunities for Canadians and to promoting global prosperity through free trade. It will work with the new administration in the United States in addressing shared challenges, especially during the current economic downturn, and seek opportunities to enhance North American competitiveness. New trade agreements will be pursued in Asia and the Americas, as well as with the European Union, to open markets for Canadian firms. Our Government will proceed with legislation to ratify the results of trade negotiations that have been concluded with the European Free Trade Association, Peru, Colombia and Jordan.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242660">Our Government will continue to invest in expanding gateways on our Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in vital border corridors such as the Detroit River International Crossing, to ensure that Canadian goods and services can reach markets in Europe, Asia and the United States.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242661">Better positioning Canada to compete for investment and market opportunities will require action at home. A fragmented regulatory environment for internal trade and commerce has for too long restricted the flow of labour and investment across the country. Our Government will work with the provinces to remove barriers to internal trade, investment and labour mobility by 2010.

Simpler and streamlined processes will make it easier for businesses to provide products and services to the government and will deliver better results for Canadians. Military procurement in particular is critical: Canada cannot afford to have cumbersome processes delay the purchase and delivery of equipment needed by our men and women in uniform.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242671">Our Government will support the development of cleaner energy sources. The natural gas that lies beneath Canada’s North represents both an untapped source of clean fuel and an unequalled avenue to creating economic opportunities for northern people. Our Government will reduce regulatory and other barriers to extend the pipeline network into the North.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242672">These measures will bring jobs to northern Canada and create employment across the country, just as they will bring new energy supplies to markets in southern Canada and throughout the world. Economic development in Canada’s North, led by a new stand-alone agency, is a key element of our Northern Strategy.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242673">Nuclear energy is a proven technology, capable of reliable, large-scale output. In Canada and around the world, energy authorities are investing in nuclear power to meet both energy security and climate change goals.

We will meet this goal while also ensuring that Canada’s actions going forward remain comparable to what our partners in the United States, Europe and other industrialized countries undertake. We will work with the provincial governments and our partners to develop and implement a North America-wide cap and trade system for greenhouse gases and an effective international protocol for the post-2012 period.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242677">To meet the challenge posed by climate change, we will also need to make greater use of technologies that do not emit greenhouse gases. Our Government will set an objective that 90 percent of Canada’s electricity needs be provided by non-emitting sources such as hydro, nuclear, clean coal or wind power by 2020. In support of this ambitious national goal, our Government will continue to provide support for biofuels, wind and other energy alternatives.

This Government will break down barriers that prevent Canadians from reaching their potential.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242682">Many working-age Canadians are faced with the dual pressure of holding down a job and caring for their family.

Our Government will take tough action against crime and work with partners to improve the administration of justice. Serious offences will be met with serious penalties. Legal provisions will be strengthened in key areas, such as youth crime, organized crime and gang violence. Gun laws will be focused on ending smuggling and stronger penalties for gun crimes, not at criminalizing law-abiding firearms owners. More broadly, Canada’s criminal justice system will be made more efficient. Citizens need to know that justice is served, and that it is served swiftly.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242689">Safety and security also mean that Canadians must be assured that the food on their dinner table, the toys they buy their children, and the medicines on which they rely are safe. Our Government will follow through with legislation providing better oversight of food, drug and consumer products. It will strengthen the power to recall products and increase penalties for violators. It will also move quickly to launch an independent investigation of this summer’s listeria outbreak and act quickly upon its findings.

          <ParaText id="1242693">Security ultimately depends upon a respect for freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Where these values are imperilled, the safety and prosperity of all nations are imperilled. Canada must have the capacity and willingness to stand for what is right, and to contribute to a better and safer world.

It is the only forum in which all Canadians, through their elected representatives, have a voice in the governance of the nation. Parliament should be an expression of our highest ideals and deepest values, our greatest hopes and grandest dreams for the future of our children. Our Government believes these ideals can only be achieved if Parliament truly reflects the character and aspirations of the Canadian people.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="1242700">Our Government will introduce legislation to move toward representation by population in the House of Commons for Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. Legislation will also be introduced to allow for nominees to the Senate to be selected by voters, to serve fixed terms of not longer than eight years, and for the Senate to be covered by the same ethics regime as the House of Commons.

It will respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and territories and will enshrine its principles of federalism in a Charter of Open Federalism.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1242724">Mr. Speaker, congratulations on your election as Speaker in this 40th Parliament of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242725">It is my honour to open the debate in consideration of the Speech from the Throne. I wish to begin by thanking the Governor General for her eloquent speech. Her Excellency was quite clear in laying out the challenges that currently face Canadian families and businesses in this time of global economic instability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242726">Canadians can rest assured that we will devote all of our energy to addressing the challenges that they face today and in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242727">I also want to express my gratitude to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for asking me to move this motion on the reply to the Speech from the Throne. It is an honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242728">I want to take a moment to thank the good people of <Affiliation DbId="128510" Type="2">Portage—Lisgar</Affiliation> for putting their faith in me as their representative in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242729">I also want to thank my husband, David, and our children, Lukas, Delaney and Parker, for their support and encouragement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242730">Indeed, all 308 members of this chamber have been granted a high honour by their constituents. I want to congratulate all of the members of the House for having earned that honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242731">In a time when many around the world cannot count on these democratic liberties, our ability to work out our different opinions peacefully and openly is testament to a country that is healthy and a democracy that works. Canada is blessed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242732">However, we all have constituents who are touched by the current instability in the global economy. These are real people with real worries. The prospect of Ottawa becoming an insular, distant and trivial place during these times would alarm them. It should also alarm each of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242733">From the government side, we recognize that while Canadians have entrusted us with a renewed and strengthened mandate in the recently concluded election, our position remains that of a minority. Minority governments are supposed to consult and cooperate with other parties whenever possible and, indeed, in these unstable economic times, such cooperation is in all of our best interests regardless of parliamentary standing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242734">I am happy to note that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has already personally consulted with the leaders of all of the opposition parties in the search for common ground in this Parliament, just as I am pleased to note that our government is prepared to heed good advice and listen to good ideas no matter where their source as long as this advice and these ideas are themselves offered in good faith. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242735">At the same time, we will be expecting the opposition parties to keep their end of the electoral bargain, to stay out of denial when it comes to respecting the clear wishes of all Canadians, for while this remains a minority Parliament, it is beyond debate that Canadians granted this government a much stronger mandate. They chose our platform as a governing blueprint and they chose the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> as the best person to lead Canada in uncertain times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242736">Canadians, therefore, deserve to see a government that is granted a reasonable accommodation to implement its governing agenda free of the tabloid politics and partisan gamesmanship that has often paralyzed this chamber in the past. Parliament must be allowed to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242737">The Governor General has already outlined the broad priorities of our government. Allow me to comment on some of these in a little more detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242738">First of all, let me talk about our government's core commitment to reforming and strengthening the global financial system. To some this might sound an awfully abstract concept. It is anything but. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242739">Prior to entering public life, I made my career in the financial planning industry. I have seen firsthand the kind of tough decisions that many individuals, small businesses and families have to make. The fact of the matter is that today we are all interconnected. Individuals and businesses throughout the world rely on a sound international financial system in order to protect the value of their investments, savings and pensions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1242740">By almost every measure, Canada's monetary policy, financial regulations and real estate sector are among the soundest in the world. We certainly avoided the excesses and pitfalls that are now plaguing our American neighbours. However, in real terms, being blameless has nothing to do with being safe. This problem is not of our own making, but it is ours to deal with all the same. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242741">The international credit crisis has made it more difficult for Canadians to obtain mortgages and pursue the dream of home ownership, just as it has made it more difficult for businesses to obtain additional credit so they can expand and create jobs. Of course, the slowdown in global growths, spurred on by this crisis, poses significant risks for our export-based economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242742">That is why we consider addressing this challenge priority number one. The Prime Minister and <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> have already concluded a series of meetings with our international counterparts to return the global financial sector to a more stable footing, based on sound domestic regulations and accountable peer review. Even though Canadians are on a more secure footing than many, this is not to say that we cannot strengthen our own way of doing things. This is no time for complacency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242743">Our government believes that as long as securities regulation in our country remains fragmented, families and businesses will be left at unnecessary risk. That is why our government remains a strong advocate of a single securities regulator in Canada, and will continue to advance this position with our provincial counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242744">It is also why we will be keeping our own house in order, and thoroughly modernize the laws and regulations around investment and competition in Canada. We will take the same pragmatic approach when it comes to ensuring sound budgeting in Canada. This includes our firm opposition to long term structural deficits, as well as our vigilance when it comes to scrutinizing all government expenditures, curtailing spending growth, eliminating waste, and streamlining the way government does business. This will require some hard decisions, but we will keep our sights focused on delivering real results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242745">As part of this effort, we are prepared to help secure jobs for families and communities, and expand investment and trade. In the modern, interconnected global economy, these two goals are forever linked. We must do more to help businesses struggling with the challenges of the new economy when such assistance is pragmatic, well-reasoned, and in the long term interest of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242746">Our government has already reduced the tax burden on families and businesses. The next step is to reduce other government barriers to success, whether those barriers are red tape standing in the way of entrepreneurs or an outdated monopoly standing in the way of our grain farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242747">We will do all of this while remaining focused on the ultimate goal: a better quality of life for new Canadians and long-time Canadians alike, to work, to gain an education, to build a home and raise a family. We must help all Canadians participate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242748">Government policies must help these people and never stand in the way. That is why we will make sure that Canada’s laws, regulations and support follow the model of our universal child care benefit, with real benefits for real people. This includes ensuring more Canadians have access to maternity and parental benefits, and it includes making it more affordable for those Canadians who care for loved ones with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242749">There is much more to say about our governing agenda, and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128429" Type="2">Mississauga—Erindale</Affiliation> will have plenty more to add, but before I yield the floor, let me offer this one last observation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242750">I am a new member of Parliament and I am not embarrassed to say that it was an awe-inspiring moment to take that first walk up Parliament Hill and to take my seat in this chamber for the first time. I know that many in this House have served as members for a long time and I can only imagine that it does become easy to lose that idealism in the cut-and-thrust and give-and-take that comes with the issues of the day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242751">However, whether we have been a member of Parliament for two weeks or two decades, we must always remember that, first and foremost, serving here is a unique privilege for all of us. With the responsibility that is entrusted to us today, we are simply custodians to a national story that is far greater than any of our own. The next chapter of this story will require us to make some difficult decisions in an uncertain time. Of course, that chapter is not yet written. All of us must live up to the ideals of this institution by doing what it takes to protect Canada's future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1242758">The government now admits that despite the Conservative rhetoric on the campaign trail, Canada is back into a financial deficit. It did not have to be that way. No, we cannot blame it on the failed policies of George W. Bush. In three short years Conservatives led the highest spending government on record. They squandered a $12 billion surplus and they burned through the $3 billion contingency fund. The government had been warned of an economic slowdown--</ParaText>

And the government has made no effort to put money away for a rainy day.</ParaText>

We will continue to provide Canadians with sound fiscal management. We have a plan. We want to see Canadians from coast to coast supported. We want to see the economy strengthened.</ParaText>

That, in my opinion, should be a priority in an economic crisis such as we are in at present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242775">What is more, there is no guarantee of complete reimbursement for seniors who were swindled out of their guaranteed income supplement. As well, the age limit for retirement savings plans should be raised from 71 to 73 years, because people are required to withdraw their funds at age 71, when we know that at this time those plans are at rock bottom and people are losing a third of their investments. So another two years could be added. These seniors are being given no attention whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242776">I am extremely surprised that the hon. member could be pleased with such a speech. As far as cultural is concerned as well, there is really a total lack of any sensitivity toward the world of culture. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1242782"> I ask the member, after all of the input the government received particularly from this side of the House and others in this place, why did her government not take this opportunity to reform the employment insurance system? That system is in desperate need of reform so that more people who qualify can count on it, the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs in the manufacturing and the forestry sectors and in other sectors across this country. Why did the government not take this opportunity to reform that very important insurance system that was put together to protect people in difficult times, especially at this time with the very serious difficult economic downturn that is coming at us?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1242786">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise today and second the motion for an Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242787">I want to thank the Governor General for her gracious remarks. I also want to thank the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for granting me this great honour, and I especially wish to thank the voters of Mississauga--Erindale for granting me the honour and privilege of serving them as their member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242788">I would also like to thank my wife, Ruth, for her care and support, and my parents for instilling in me, at an early age, a respect for this great institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242789">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128510" Type="2">Portage—Lisgar</Affiliation> has spoken already about much of our governing agenda. I would like to add some thoughts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242790">In the broadest possible terms, Her Excellency's speech focused on a single key theme: protecting Canada's future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242791">We live in a time of challenge and change. This is true internationally, and it is most certainly true here at home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242792">Our government is mindful of the responsibility with which we have been entrusted. We will protect Canada's future. We will follow through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242793">Of course this begs the question of what it means to protect Canada's future. It means, first and foremost, protecting Canadians' personal financial security. This means taking action, in concert with our global allies and trading partners, to address the global credit crisis. The credit crunch is still causing hardship to too many current and potential homeowners, as well as to businesses looking to grow and expand. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has already announced several steps to protect the finances of Canadians in these uncertain times, and I am sure my fellow members join me in looking forward to his upcoming economic update.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242794">Protecting Canadians' personal financial security also means understanding the distress caused by the current turmoil in global stock markets, including Canada's own. This is a frustrating challenge, to be sure. Free markets, by their very nature, cannot be controlled by government policy. They are as much about psychology as they are about economics, but the impact of the roller-coaster ride on the markets is very real. These are people's personal pensions, their savings, and their RRSPs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242795">Turmoil on the markets is therefore not just a Bay Street concern; it is a Main Street concern, which is why we must reassure investors inside and outside Canada that our regulatory system, our monetary policy, and our overall financial balance sheets remain strong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242796">What we must not do is provide investors inside or outside Canada with as much as a whiff of panic. That is why we know that knee-jerk reactions to the latest economic headlines are the wrong way to go. That is why we maintain that Canada's financial sector is well managed, on a sound footing, and in far better shape than those of most other countries, an assessment that is shared internationally by groups ranging from the World Economic Forum to the IMF, and that is why we will continue to work with our allies and trading partners on a smart, coordinated, long-term and global response to this crisis, because it is impossible for any one country to stabilize its own markets when everywhere else there is turmoil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242797">Protecting Canada's future also means protecting Canada's economy, and that includes Canadian jobs, investment, and trade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242798">My own professional background happens to include international business and trade law. I have seen a lot of economic cycles over the years, and it is true that this situation currently before us is unlike anything we have seen. Some of the reactions, however, are predictable. In a time of economic instability, there is always a tendency by some to respond by proposing closed borders, restricting trade, and advocating protectionist measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242799"> Protectionist sentiment is an unfortunate and natural reaction to economic anxiety. It is unfortunate because protectionism ends up destroying jobs and reducing the standard of living of the very people it is supposed to help. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242800">Our government will continue to support open trade. We will do so by continuing to seek out new trading opportunities, be it through pursuing cross-border opportunities with the incoming Obama administration in the United States or through pursuing new trade agreements in Europe, Asia, the Americas and elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242801">We will also continue to invest in the Atlantic and Pacific gateways and in vital border corridors, such as the Detroit River international crossing. This will increase trade, investment, and jobs on both coasts and in border towns as well as ensure that Canadian goods and services reach the markets of our trading partners. We will encourage economic development in the north by reducing the regulatory hurdles on the construction of pipelines so that northerners can see more real benefits from their natural riches.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1242802">Canadian workers facing transition can continue to count on our support. We will continue to look for new ways to support vital sectors of our economy, whether they be in manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, fisheries or mining, so Canadians can continue to compete and succeed on the world stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242803">Protecting Canada's future also means protecting the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242804">I cannot put it more plainly than this: the environment is now an economic issue. We cannot separate the commitment to long term environmental sustainability with that of long term economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242805">Our government remains firmly on course to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 and, as the Governor General informed us, we will set an objective that 90% of our electricity needs will be met by non-emitting sources by that date as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242806">Where once Canadians found themselves adapting to a time of unprecedented high oil prices, today we find ourselves adapting to the new normal of a lower international price of oil. In some ways this is a benefit. Canadians who were shocked by high gas prices in recent months are now saving money each time they fill up at the pumps. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242807">However, at the same time, given that much of our economy is dependent on the energy sector, these lower prices create certain economic challenges as well. Our government sees this as an opportunity to diversify the energy sector in our country and, in particular, an opportunity to continue to develop new, cleaner energy sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242808">Protecting Canada's future also means protecting the health and safety of Canadians. Our government will continue to build on the successes of the last Parliament to ensure that our laws respect the victims, protect the innocent and hold the guilty accountable for their crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242809">Considering that the threat of global terrorism is still very real, we will also table a new national security statement that will clearly detail the steps we will take to ensure that Canadians are protected from terrorism and other serious global threats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242810">We will also continue modernizing our food and safety laws to ensure that Canadians can always have faith in the products on their store shelves. There will be new accountability, more oversight, more recall powers and increased penalties for those who put the health and safety of Canadians at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242811">Protecting Canada's future also means contributing to global security. Just as our financial security is linked to the global economy, Canada's physical security is linked to the stability and security of other nations around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242812">We will continue to protect Canada's borders, including our Arctic frontier. We will continue to promote the Canadian values of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law on the world stage. Canada will not shirk its obligation to stand up for these human values and human rights because freedom, democracy and the rule of law are the pathway to a better, safer world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242813">We will continue to rebuild the Canadian Forces with the best possible equipment to protect our brave soldiers when they are in harm's way. While we will continue to engage in the international mission in Afghanistan, we will focus more of our attention on reconstruction and development, while preparing to end the military side of the mission in 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242814">Protecting Canada's future also means building stronger institutions and strengthening our representative democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242815">Politics is a competitive business. We all know that. However, when it comes to big national projects, projects that by nature and necessity transcend traditional, regional or partisan divides, we owe it to ourselves, our constituents and future generations to make government accountable and effective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242816">Now our government has introduced some positive reforms to our democratic institutions that we believe are examples of positive, non-partisan reforms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242817">Ensuring that the House better reflects the Canadian population or introducing democracy to the Senate are concepts on which all Canadians should be able to agree. We will continue to pursue these stronger, more democratic institutions, and we will welcome any cross-party support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242818">We will also continue to strengthen Confederation itself. As members know, it was just last week that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> met with the premiers to discuss the current global economic instability. Canada works best when we all work together. We will continue to respect the jurisdiction of the provinces while ensuring that federal transfers are sufficient to ensure that all Canadians can count on world-class health, education and other services close to home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242819">Perhaps the most important institution of all is this House. In this chamber every Canadian is supposed to have a voice through their elected representatives. Canadians do not expect us to agree on everything, but they do want our voices, their elected voices, to be focused on solutions and not on divisive rancour.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1242828">The Speech from the Throne made it clear that the Conservative government did not understand the message Quebeckers were trying to send. Seventy-eight per cent of Quebeckers did not vote for the Conservative Party, and there is a reason for that. They did not like this government's positions, and they did not want what it had to offer. They did not like what the government planned to do with young offenders, and they really did not like the idea of cuts to culture. In Quebec, there was an outcry against such cuts. Clearly, the government did not get it, because the Speech from the Throne had nothing to say about bringing back that funding. Yet culture is hugely important in Quebec. We not only love and respect our artists, but we also consume a lot of what they produce. Why? Because we are a nation, and our artists represent Quebec culture. We are very proud of them. Yet there was nothing at all in the Speech from the Throne for artists and the arts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242829">I had the opportunity, if not the pleasure, to attend the Conservative Party convention last Thursday, where I heard the Prime Minister give a speech about his election campaign to his supporters. He did not say that he understood what Quebeckers wanted, nor did he acknowledge that they were not happy with what he had to offer them. He did not suggest that the government should therefore be more conciliatory and offer something else to Quebeckers, or that it should change, or that it should reach out to them and listen carefully to what they have to say. He said nothing of the kind. He said that, basically, Quebeckers did not understand the Conservative Party, that the party was going to find some other way to get its message across, and that it was going to repeat that message as many times as necessary to convince Quebeckers that it was right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1242830">Given the current economic context, it is understandable that the government would deliver a throne speech focused on the economy. That makes sense, and the Bloc, too, wants to act on the issue without delay. However, this raises the following question: why would the government indicate, in its throne speech, that it wants to hurt a thriving economic sector—the cultural industry—all the while seeking to create programs that will help industry in general?</ParaText>
