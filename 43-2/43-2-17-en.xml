International organizations such as the World Health Organization, United Nations Women and the United Nations Children's Fund have identified unequal sex ratios at birth as a growing problem internationally, and Canada's health care professionals have indicated that it is a growing problem here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297523"> She said: Mr. Speaker, the motion before the House today is probably the most important thing that Parliament could be dealing with right now and that is how we as a country collectively move forward to address the COVID-19 crisis. We are in the middle of a time when we are seeing increases in cases across the country. Provinces, workplaces, schools; everybody is concerned with this. We are seeing restrictions come back in cities across the country, people losing their jobs and people being separated from their loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297524">We need to figure out how to move forward, given the uncertainty of a vaccine as we do not know when it is coming. We need a better plan forward than just an economic shutdown, endless quarantines and endless isolation. That is what this motion is designed to do. It was put forward at the health committee nearly two weeks ago today. Liberal members filibustered that motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297525">I will be splitting my time with the Leader of the Opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297526">This motion is before the House. The motion is very simple. It outlines all of the areas that Parliament should be tasked with reviewing. We are trying to find out what is working and what is not, so that we can move forward so that Canadians can have certainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297527">I had a whole speech prepared today, but then I got a call from a very close friend in Montreal last night telling me that her mother, Antonietta Ferri, had passed away from COVID-19. The circumstances in which she passed away could have been prevented if we had a better plan. My friend's elderly mother and elderly father did everything right. They completely isolated, but were infected by somebody who helped to care for them. They had the best of intentions but did not have access to testing and did not know who infected them. They ended up being separated during their hospitalizations. Can colleagues imagine being married for decades and then being separated while struggling and suffering? Now the family cannot be with the father because of the lack of access to tests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297528">When Barb told me about that last night, I thought, “This is why we need this motion.” This is what we all need to be working on right now. There is nothing in this motion that is partisan. It is just saying what is working, what is not working, what have we done, what have we not done, what is the best practice around the world and how do we move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297529">I have been very disappointed reading the media coverage of the Liberals on this last night and this morning. I want to go through the talking points that they are going to use today as I want to debunk them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297530">First of all, they are going to say that this is unfair to the civil service. I have great respect for Canada's public service. They are working so hard right now and I cannot believe that any single one of them would want to be unfair to Canadians and not provide this information to Parliament. We need to scrutinize this information. We have not had a budget in nearly two years and our committees have not sat because of prorogation. It is past due that every person in this place of any political stripe has access to this information, so that we can understand how we can best move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297531">Second, they have said that this motion would paralyze government. I saw that in a CP article today. Let us be clear. The only people who have paralyzed government are from the Liberal Party of Canada. They shuttered Parliament during the pandemic, they prorogued Parliament and now they are filibustering the health committee on this motion. If they actually wanted to study the pandemic or deal with the pandemic, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in his motion earlier this week, they will pass this motion. They will vote in favour of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297532">The point of order that the <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> raised earlier today about it being impossible to produce these documents is a matter for debate. If the Liberals think that is impossible, they need to explain and debate why that is so, and then propose a motion to be debated in this place to remind them that that is the function of this place. The function of this place is to figure things out and move forward, not just say that it is inconvenient for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to answer questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297533"> I remind them that this place has a role and it is completely right to ask questions like the one that the Canadian Press did not get an answer to yesterday. A simple question: Who gets the rapid test when, using what criteria? The Public Health Agency of Canada and the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> did not even bother returning the phone call, so we need these documents. We need to do the job. We need certainty. That is why we are compelling this today. There is no partisan language in here.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297534">It is simply saying the health committee should be studying the pandemic in the middle of the pandemic. To do that, we need information so we understand what witnesses to call and where to dig. For months, we have not had the scrutiny and there has been paralysis in getting rapid tests. We do not know where $1 billion worth of PPE went because Liberals have been obstructing. We need clarity. We need to do this so we can plan to move forward. If we do not know what is working and what is not and we cannot get answers to basic questions, then we cannot have a plan going forward, and that is the role of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297535">Yesterday the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asked whether the Conservatives had confidence in government. This was a confidence motion. How can we know if we have confidence in the government's response to the pandemic if we cannot scrutinize its actions? That is what has happened over the last several months: the shuttering of Parliament, the prorogation of Parliament, committees not sitting and the filibustering of committees, especially the health committee. How do Canadians know if they should have confidence in the Liberal government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297536">Of course, the Liberals want everyone to have confidence, to think it is great, that everything is working, but there are basic questions that have not been answered. The fact is that Canada does not have widely available rapid testing. Those watching today should try to get a COVID test and get the results in 15 minutes. I challenge anyone watching this. They are not going to be able to do it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297537">It was only when Parliament started asking questions about this that we saw some acknowledgement that this was an issue. That is why Parliament matters and that is why this motion matters. It matters to people like my friend Barb and her mom Antonietta, who lost her life. We need to be asking these questions. She needs justice. We need to make sure that situation is not repeating itself time and time again across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297538">Nobody of any political stripe can accept that a committee cannot be looking into basic information around the pandemic. The documents that we are requesting are completely reasonable for the Canadian public to understand. For example, we are trying to understand why the government shut down the early pandemic warning system, what impact it had on the spread of COVID-19 and whether that led the government to rely on World Health Organization data as opposed to stuff that has already come in from the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297539">Liberals are saying everything is fine, but their advice keeps changing. They have not said what best practice is, they are not saying who they are listening to. How can any Canadian take the advice of the government if the government is not clear on who it is listening to and why? The <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was asked a similar question in the press conference this morning. He was asked who he is listening to. Who is the government listening to? I would like to know. I would like those documents so I can review them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297540">What else is in the motion? We want to know what the government's procurement processes have been around things like PPE. We want to know information about the procurement for vaccines, how the government is going to distribute them and what is happening with all of these things. We want to know about the government's COVID-19 vaccine task force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297541">To anybody who is watching this and has heard to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader</Affiliation> or the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader </Affiliation>say that this is unreasonable, the only reason they will say this is unreasonable is because they have something to hide. The time for hiding stuff is over. They have had months of shuttering this place. It is time for Parliament to reign. If they are confident that everything is going well, there will be nothing in here other than accolades for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297542">The goal of this information is not to do anything nefarious. It is simply to show Canadians that Parliament cares about figuring out the best way forward. By no standards right now can we say everything is fine. It is not an indictment of anyone. The number of COVID cases are rising, things are shutting down and we need Parliament to do its job, to scrutinize the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been spent on this and find out whether that investment is working. It is not enough for the Liberals to say we should just take their word for it. No, it is our job to scrutinize that. That is why Canadians pay us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297543">When the government talks about moving forward with a team Canada approach, I say giddy-up, let us do it. Let us get these documents, let us get this committee study going and let us get down to business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297563">They will not even let us speak about the most significant crisis our country has faced. They are saying that is going to involve printing a lot of documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297564">My family has had a personal experience with this, and thankfully Rebecca and I have recovered. We received good advice from public health supports here in Ottawa. Our children were fortunate, through distancing, not to become infected. They had several tests and are now back at school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297565">We also experienced the uncertainty of the direction of the government, which has changed its mind several times on fundamental advice to the public. We were in line for hours, like Canadians across the country have been, because of the failure to follow through on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s statements about rapid testing and tracing in March. The government was slow to close the border, which meant we had more transmission and community-spread cases. We have to learn our lesson.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297566">My family and I waited in line for a long time to get tested. We dealt with the stress of getting contradictory information and we experienced first-hand the health effects of COVID-19. Fortunately, we made a quick recovery. We were lucky.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297567">However, I am thinking of the thousands of Canadians who have lost a loved one, and of all those who would still be with us if we had been better prepared. Those families are what motivates me to hold the government to account, and small business owners who are struggling are what encourages me to find better solutions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6297568">As I have said, Parliament did not sit through the worst of the pandemic, but Parliament is sitting now and has a responsibility to ensure that Canada learns the lessons from the first wave of the pandemic. We are in a second wave in some parts of the province, and it is clear the government has not learned. We are simply asking that the health committee of Parliament, Canadians of all party stripes, be able to examine this to make sure Canada strives to be the best in its response, not a laggard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297569">As I said, the government seems to take comfort in comparing itself to our friends from the south and comparing to the worst response. We should be comparing to the best. That is what I strive for in my life. It is what I know my colleagues do. The government has been out of touch, late, slow and confused in every single aspect of the response. That is why it does not want to answer questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297570">Just like yesterday, when the Liberals did not want to answer questions on sending millions of dollars to insiders and friends of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and an elite few in the Liberal Party, now they do not want to answer questions about the well-being of Canadians. That should concern Canadians. That should concern the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>, whose duty it is to report to Parliament and be held to account. Only the arrogance of the Liberals would lead them to think they are beyond questioning, and that we could not possibly do anything better because the Liberal Party is in charge. It is that entitlement and arrogance Canadians are tiring of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297571">During my time in the Canadian Armed Forces, we had something called lessons learned: the after-action report. In the private sector, there is process improvement. There are even systems like Six Sigma and others. Every serious organization in the world learns from experience and makes sure to get it better next time. In the military, it is literally life or death. In a pandemic, it is life or death too.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297572">That is the reason for today's debate. We have to learn from the first wave of this pandemic. That is why we will continue to ask reasonable questions for the health and well-being of Canadians. That is our role.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6297573">This will be a good review for the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>. I am glad she is here. In January, five departments of the federal government were aware of the risks of the pandemic: The Canadian Armed Forces, Foreign Affairs, Public Works, the Privy Council and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office were all aware of the risks. They did nothing. We would have been even better prepared if, the year before, the Liberals had not killed the intelligence warning system. The Global Public Health Intelligence Network was a world leader until they stopped it and substituted data from China for data from our experts. We were ill prepared when it hit. When the first warnings came in, the Liberals ignored them. In fact, they were warned, and I know from talking to suppliers that China was hoarding PPE in late January and early February. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297574">What did the government do? It sent PPE to China, which was probably the most boneheaded decision in history of a government during a pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297575">Then the Liberals were late on the border, as I said this morning in my press conference. Since the Middle Ages, closing the border has been used to stop the spread of pandemics. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">minister </Affiliation>should read some history. When there is uncertainty about transmission, the government should put the public health of Canadians first instead of tripping along, relying on friends from Beijing. The minister said there was no person-to-person spread, no risk of closing the border and, on some occasions, accused reporters and opposition parliamentarians of being intolerant for even asking those questions. Again, it was the arrogance of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297576">We all remember the flip-flopping on mask usage. Many people were asking about mask usage in Europe. Facebook told them that they should change their minds on mask usage. People were sharing information and best practices that the government was not providing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297577">Then, of course, there are the provinces. They were the front lines. Because we were two months late with the border, the community spread in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver largely originated on flights from China, Iran and Italy. The slow movement by the federal government led to more community spread. That same slow movement on rapid tests, until my friend from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> started pushing, has our airports less equipped than most of our OECD allies'. Italy has rapid tests in some of its airports. I would like to see the government not striving for the bottom, but striving for the best when it comes to the health and well-being of Canadians. That is what an opposition does: It holds the government to account, asks questions and demands a better response. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297579">The committee will also have to look at the COVID Alert app to ensure that the messages are being sent in both official languages. That is what Quebeckers, Canadians and francophone communities expect from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who admitted he did not consult Dr. Tam before threatening an election, is willing to be cavalier with the health of Canadians for his own political skin.

I share the member's deep concerns for Canadians during this unprecedented health crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297604">The emergence of COVID-19 has changed how we live, how we work and how we interact with friends and family. It has disrupted our lives and our communities in ways that we could not have conceived of a year ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297605"> As we emerged from the first wave, we saw cases go down over the summer, giving Canada a bit of a reprieve from this terrible virus. However, by fall, case counts began to increase, first in young people but then spreading to others, including, most alarming, to elderly people, who we know are most at risk of dying of COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297606">Most Canadians are worried, and many are frustrated to see our country experience, like so many others around the world, a resurgence of the disease. With winter approaching, Canadians are looking for information. They want the facts. They want to know what is happening and what we are going to do next, as leaders and as citizens, to protect one another.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6297607">Unfortunately, there is a lot of false information circulating on line and in social media. This amplifies the anxiety that many people are feeling right now. Earlier this week, Dr. Tam spoke about false information that is spreading faster than the virus.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6297608">This is a dangerous development. We have to work together to combat false information. That is why strong public health leadership is essential during a coronavirus pandemic, and why upholding confidence in our scientists and researchers, indeed in our experts, is so important. The Public Health Agency of Canada has consistently provided strong leadership since the first reports of COVID-19 started coming in late December. The agency has provided clear and direct information to Canadians about how they can protect their health and what they can do to protect the health of each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297609"> A critical part of the agency's work has been to bring together the public health officials across the country to coordinate our nation's response. Provinces and territories have stepped up measures to contain the spread, declaring states of emergency, closing schools and day cares, and providing other public supports. They have prepared their hospital systems, while continuing to deliver needed services, increasing intensive care capacity and making sure that they have the equipment on hand to deal with every situation. Governments at all levels are taking every step necessary to protect their residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297610"> Canada has demonstrated an organized and collaborative approach, with partners working together and supporting each other. In fact, this collaboration is exactly what Canadians need so that they can have the tools, the support, the information and the confidence to slow the spread of this virus.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297611">Our government acted quickly to help Canadians during the first wave. We put more resources online to help them take care of their mental well-being. We also developed apps to inform Canadians and better combat the virus. In May, we confirmed a $240.5-million investment to work with the provinces and territories to provide better access to virtual health care services.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297612">Virtual tools allow Canadians to engage safely with their regular health care providers via phone, text or video conference. They have also allowed patients to access specialist services during this time of uncertainty. Virtual tools have also provided access to trusted information, including the Canada COVID-19 mobile app, so that Canadians can understand and track their symptoms, and learn more about how to stay safe during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297613">We also recognize that Canadians have been coping with the effects of COVID-19 from a mental health perspective, and they are facing different degrees of stress. That is why we launched Wellness Together Canada, a free online portal that offers virtual mental health, well-being and substance use supports to any Canadian who needs it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297614">Our government is working closely with provinces and territories, innovators and others to support the rapid expansion of virtual care services and to continue to make these tools available to Canadians and their families.

              <ParaText id="6297618">As the work continues on vaccines, we are also pursuing new tools, as quickly as they are invented, that will help us live safely with COVID-19. This includes fast and effective testing and screening. Health Canada is working full speed to improve rapid point-of-care diagnostic and monitoring tests based on nucleic acid and antigen technologies to meet Canadian testing needs, without compromising on standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297619">As of October 21, Health Canada has authorized two antigen tests for the diagnostics of COVID-19, the Abbott Panbio and the Bd Veritor system. Antigen testing is one of the several emerging technologies that can be used to determine if a person is, in fact, infected with COVID-19. The test works by detecting specific proteins associated with the virus. Samples for these tests need to be collected using a nose swab and are designed to provide results within twenty minutes, and the test needs to be carried out by a health care professional. To date, Health Canada has authorized 41 COVID-19 testing devices for sale in Canada, and a complete list of authorized testing devices is available on Health Canada's website, along with many that are under review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297620">In addition to this, as Minister of Health I signed an interim order that has helped speed up access to COVID-19 test kits. This follows the interim order I signed in March, which allowed for the exceptional importation of products related to COVID-19. When drugs are not available, Health Canada now has a legal pathway to bring alternative supplies of drugs to the Canadian market. A similar approach is also in place for medical devices. Health Canada is also doing what it can to plan ahead so that our country is in the best possible position to access drugs to treat and prevent COVID-19 as they become available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297621">The health and safety of Canadians is the government's top priority. Before any test is authorized for use in Canada, it is subject to a thorough assessment by Health Canada's regulatory process to ensure that it is supported by sufficient evidence of safety, effectiveness and quality. We continue to engage with international regulators so that we can share this knowledge about new developments related to testing. We proactively approach companies that have received approvals for testing technologies from other regulators, and we invite those companies to apply for authorization in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297622">We are also committed to global collaboration to end this pandemic, because this government knows that we will not see an end to COVID-19 unless we work together with all other countries. We are supporting multiple organizations that are working at unprecedented speed to develop candidate vaccines. Last month the government committed $440 million to the COVAX Facility. Of this amount $220 million will secure additional options for Canada to purchase doses of vaccine for Canadians. The other $220 million will finance the procurement of doses for low- and middle-income countries through the COVAX advance market commitment. We have also previously provided an initial contribution of $25 million to the COVAX Facility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297623">By joining this initiative, Canada is contributing funds toward collective efforts to develop a safe, effective and accessible COVID-19 vaccine for 172 participating economies across the world. This mechanism also allows Canada to secure additional options for vaccine doses for use here. This approach complements the bilateral arrangements that we have in place with vaccine manufacturers and diversifies our investment in potential opportunities, but supporting other countries in their fight against COVID-19 is an investment to protect Canada and Canadians because this virus truly knows no borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297624">The government is also working to ensure that health care and front-line workers have the PPE, medical equipment and supplies that they require to do their jobs. We are doing this through collaborative procurement with the provinces and territories, building domestic production capacity and identifying potential alternatives and ways to extend product life. We have worked very rapidly to allocate PPE, medical equipment and supplies to the provinces and territories. I want to thank my colleagues, the ministers of health from across the country, for agreeing on an approach that is supported by all levels of government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297627">During the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Canada, long-term care facilities suffered a disproportionately high number of cases and, sadly, many deaths as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297628"> In early April, the Public Health Agency of Canada released evidence-informed guidance for long-term care homes to help resident seniors and health care workers in long-term care homes remain safe and healthy. The guidance provides recommendations that complement provincial and territorial public health efforts to prevent and control health care associated infections. It was developed with the National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control and endorsed by the pan-Canadian Special Advisory Committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297629">Also in April, the Canadian Armed Forces received a request for assistance to help provide care to some of Canada's most vulnerable seniors in response to COVID-19. CAF deployed personnel in support of long-term care facilities across Quebec and in the Greater Toronto Area as part of Operation Laser.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297630"> Throughout these deployments, military personnel have worked closely with facility staff to help with day-to-day operations, support infection control and prevention, and provide general support and comfort wherever needed. I want to thank the serving members of CAF for their incredible generosity and kindness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297631">As we enter the second wave of the outbreak, though, it is incredibly important that we work together to ensure that seniors in long-term care homes are protected. That is why public health officials are closely monitoring COVID-19 cases in Canada and considering public health restrictions needed to protect the vulnerable. However, the epidemiology of COVID-19 is different across jurisdictions, which means that the approach across Canada will not be the same in every place and will need to be tailored to the unique challenges and contexts of the disease in each province and territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297632">This summer, our government announced an agreement with provinces and territories that provides $19 billion to protect the health of Canadians, to get people safely back to work and to prepare for a resurgence. The safe restart agreement includes investments in priority areas for the next six to eight months, including supporting the most vulnerable, which includes seniors in long-term care facilities and nursing homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297633">Canada has successfully enhanced public health surveillance for COVID-19 in very short order, strengthening our ability to monitor the number of cases, trends over time, severity of cases and demographics of cases. This information is shared with the public, with regular updates made on the canada.ca/covid-19/coronavirus website. I am very happy that all levels of government are working so closely to share this information and to provide timely evidence, which not only informs and supports the public health response but provides access to researchers and scientists who are studying COVID-19 in the Canadian context and providing very valuable evidence that can draw our future responses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297634">The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on needed improvements related to public health data systems in Canada, and this includes timeliness, completeness and granularity. Systemic and long-standing challenges affect Canada's health data system, including resources and capacity, IT infrastructure and clarity, and data governance. However, we need to make progress in these areas because federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions not only have an obligation to gather and make good use of data but their citizens require that data in order to stay safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297635">In addition, the $19 billion invested in the safe restart agreement, which includes funding to increase testing, contact tracing and data management, included monies to ensure the safety of seniors in long-term care homes by improving infectious disease protocols. Our goal is to ensure that Canada has the data intelligence needed to identify, prevent, monitor and respond to current and future health issues, protect the health of Canadians and support the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297636">Across Canada, all levels of government are pulling out the stops to help slow the spread of the virus, but, ultimately, individual decisions and choices also have a critical impact on public health and safety. The Government of Canada has a consistent message to Canadians: “Protect yourselves and others, wash your hands, practise social distancing, stay home when you are sick and wear a mask.” These things can help manage the spread of the virus. Also, download the COVID Alert app to help slow the spread. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297637">I am so proud of Canadians and the sacrifices they have made to keep each other safe. We need to keep it up until it is safe again to slowly and carefully dial back the measures that we now have in place. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297638">This is just a snapshot of what the government is doing to protect the health and safety of Canadians from COVID-19. As we can imagine, an incalculable amount of work is going on behind the scenes with our many partners across all orders of government and indeed with researchers and scientists who are generously donating their time and energy to help all Canadians. All of this work deepens our understanding of the virus every day. It gives us the scientific evidence and the data we need to inform and evolve our public health response to help with decision-making and planning at local, national and international levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297639">We have learned about this virus over the past year. We have learned that if we relax too much or too soon, COVID-19 will certainly come back. We must continue with strong public health efforts to reduce the transmission of the virus and minimize its overall impact, including the social and economic impacts on Canadians. We must also plan and be ready for the future as there is still so much that we do not know about COVID-19. As the situation evolves, so too must our response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297640">Finally, it is unfortunate that this motion is specifically designed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> for the government to have such a challenge to respond. Our initial analysis of the motion indicates that the very officials who are working day and night on Canada's response will be removed from their immediate tasks. In fact, instead of working together to protect Canadians during this difficult time, the member would prefer to divert their focus to an unnecessary task that does not help Canadians in any way manage the months to come, this at a time when COVID-19 cases are surging across the country and posing unprecedented challenges on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297641">We need to stay focused on what matters now. We do not do the post-battle review in the middle of the fight. I can assure everyone that the Government of Canada will continue to do everything within its power and jurisdiction to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health, safety and well-being of Canadians during these difficult and challenging times.</ParaText>

I believe that right now it would be best for the department to stay focused on what is really important, which is how we will help Canadians through the next wave. It is how we will ensure the provinces and territories have what they need. It is also how we will ensure that we have the vaccines and that they will unfold in way that access is available to Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297673">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253121" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297674">The first words out of my mouth when parliamentary activities resumed in the House were about patients who had been really hard hit by COVID-19. I expressed my compassion for the families, for those who are still suffering the after-effects of the disease, and for those who did not survive it. I also expressed particular concern for patients with diseases other than COVID-19, because the pandemic has definitely caused collateral damage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297675">Today is an opposition day, during which we will be debating a motion that should have been adopted on October 9. I will give a shout out to all patients with rare diseases who, had it not been for the Liberal Party’s systematic filibustering, were expecting us to adopt my motion on new guidelines for the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board on October 9.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297676">Had the motion been adopted, we could have invited these patients to tell us how these guidelines are affecting their lives, their right to life and their access to innovative medications. I salute these patients because we often forget those who are currently suffering the collateral damage caused by this unprecedented global health crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297677">I hope that the House will adopt this motion and that my Liberal colleagues will set aside the powers of their executive authority. To sit in the House, a person must first be elected a representative of the people. Since democracy is based on legislative power and not on executive power, I am asking the hon. members of the Liberal Party to take on the role of legislators in their capacity as representatives of the people, and to take a step back from government requirements. I am asking them to do the same thing we are doing in the opposition, namely to review the Liberal government’s management of the pandemic and hold the government accountable, rather than act as the lackeys of the executive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297678">I am asking the House to adopt this motion so that the Standing Committee on Health can move on. I would have expected the representatives of the Liberal Party to be prepared, at the meetings following October 9, including the one last Monday, to introduce amendments. The <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government</Affiliation> told us that it would be helpful if we were a bit more flexible with wait times. What is he waiting for to propose amendments to the motion?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297679">Now, this morning, we are discussing a motion in the House that should already have been adopted. During the first wave of the pandemic, there was a spirit of collaboration among colleagues, as we tried to find solutions and to understand what we were up against and how we could help fight the pandemic. All of the experts who came to see us told us that there would soon be a second wave, and that it could be even more deadly and more difficult to handle. Why? Because there is currently no vaccine, no medication and no reliable serological testing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297680">We are simply managing time and space: personal space of two metres and the time needed to develop a vaccine. Until we have a vaccine, we remain vulnerable. We have spent a considerable amount of money. We have spent billions of dollars, and that is okay because we need to support people and the economy. Of the $340 billion dollars spent, barely 2% went to health care, at a time when we are experiencing the world’s worst health crisis. There is a problem here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297681">The Parliamentary Budget Officer says that we must be careful, because if we incur deficits of $340 billion in the next two years, we will have a serious problem. To get through this crisis, we need to distinguish between one-off investments, or one-off spending, and sustainable investments that will help us get back on our feet. Health transfers, one of the items on the motion’s agenda, are a major component of the solution for fighting future pandemics—because there will be others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297682">Since Parliament resumed, the Liberal government has been playing the bully. It says that we failed in long-term care facilities and that it was forced to send in the army. In passing, Quebec taxpayers pay for that army. Sometimes we even send it on missions abroad. It was not unreasonable to ask it for help on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297683">There was a shortage of personal protective equipment. Personal support workers and front-line workers were not properly protected at first, because there was a shortage. We quickly learned that the national stockpile was empty. We also learned that we had sent aid elsewhere, since we were certain we would never be affected. Cuts have been made to health transfers for the past 25 years. When you are managing health care and there are needs in your own back yard, you try to cover all bases and attend to the most urgent things first. Unfortunately, some employees had to work in two or three different long-term care facilities to make ends meet. That does not help when it comes to limiting contagion in a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297684">I would like us all to do some soul-searching and assume our responsibilities. We are able to impose standards on ourselves to ensure that we never again abandon our seniors living in long-term care facilities. That is clear. We are able to assume our responsibilities, but we do not want someone who has a 25-year record of broken promises to come and tell us how to work and how to do what is good for us. The Liberals are also saying that it is going to take money to implement standards. They do not even know what they are talking about when they talk about standards, because the issue of long-term care facilities is not the same in every province. I wish them luck. One need only look at the differences between Quebec and Ontario. The government does not have the expertise or the skills required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297685">Since everyone is concerned about health, the federal governments want to have a say. However, they have had 25 years in which to keep their word and allocate the funding needed to take care of people. It is our money and they need to give it back to us. We want transfers of 35%, not 22%. Now it looks like they might be more like 18%. We need $22 billion now just to make up for lost ground. The federal government is always saying that it gives a lot. However, the provinces contribute $188 billion, while the federal level contributes $42 billion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297686">There is not enough money, and it is time for the federal government to contribute instead of lecturing us. What we want the government to do now is tell us that it will support all the networks, invest, and do what Quebec and the provinces are asking it to do so that we can, at long last, rehabilitate our networks and take care of people in Quebec and elsewhere.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297698">Mr. Speaker, I too am on the health committee, and I share with the member many of the frustrations we are dealing with at committee in trying to get back to studying this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297699">There are two big issues I have with this motion. The first is the sheer volume of documents that are required. Second, in the motion there is a list of what the Conservatives and other opposition parties want to study, and we were certainly not consulted on that list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297700">The motion sets a menu, and it was set without the input of the Liberals. Frankly, I think the menu left out a whole bunch of things, such as how we managed the risk faced by northern indigenous communities and how we managed the risk faced by the homeless. There is also nothing on that list about the global response to the pandemic and our desire, perhaps, to ensure that people around the world have access to vaccines through COVAX. In my mind, it is an inadequate list.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6297705">Mr. Speaker, dealing with a pandemic is not part of our normal routine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297706">The last pandemic, the Spanish flu, was over 100 years ago. Obviously, no one here today was alive at the time, not even the member for <Affiliation DbId="252700" Type="2">Bécancour—Nicolet—Saurel</Affiliation>—I love you, Louis—despite what some people may think. As much as we would have liked to draw lessons from that last major pandemic, it would have been difficult because the context and realities were so different back then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297707">Over the past few months, we have experienced huge disruptions in all areas of our lives, including the personal, social, economic, technological and other aspects. We came together and worked shoulder to shoulder. We needed to act quickly to help our fellow citizens. What I have heard in my discussions with representatives from the Regroupement des gens d'affaires de Beauport is that the programs were not perfect, but quick action was needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297708">We have not won the battle yet: The virus is still here. Our fellow citizens still need help and support, and they need reassurance about the future. Do we have everything we need to face another wave or another pandemic? How can we ensure that we can meet our health care needs as well as those of the public without getting so far into debt that we cannot get out again? How can we hold our heads high and still be a country aware of its own needs and those of less fortunate countries?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297709">My training is in high school history and geography. Knowing our history helps us learn about our successes and failures both as humans and as a society. Knowing and understanding our past, even our recent past, helps us prevent certain errors and build on our successes. To accomplish that, like historians, we need more than one source of information. Today, my aim is to emphasize the importance of planning, openness and collaboration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297710">Let me go back a bit. In October and November 2019, when many of us, including myself, were barely starting to understand our responsibilities and duties as members, we learned of a new disease raging in Wuhan, China. The disease was so contagious that the authorities quickly decided to lock down the city. In fact, one of the first issues I was entrusted with had to do with repatriation. I made sure that, once citizens were back home, they quarantined. I also made sure that they had access to a support network during their 14-day quarantine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297711">Not long after that, we learned that the Chinese authorities had built two new hospitals in record time. I began wondering about our level of preparedness. What did we learn from the SARS crisis in Toronto? What would we need? Did we have it? If we did not have it, or if we did not have enough of it, how would we get it? Could we produce it ourselves? How long would it take? What would it cost? Are our health care infrastructures prepared? Are our government infrastructures prepared? What is our plan to help the population deal with the lockdown?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297712">Essentially, I wanted to know whether Canada had an emergency plan. Anyone who knows me knows that I am always asking 15,000 questions. Unfortunately, today, I cannot say that we had a plan, despite the fact that we lived through SARS and had a unique opportunity to see what was going on elsewhere in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297713">We rapidly established contact with Asian suppliers to obtain surgical and N95 masks, latex and nitrile gloves, and gowns. Ordinary folks stepped up. Distilleries like Stadaconé Distillery in Beauport—Limoilou and Vice &amp; Vertu Distillery in Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures began using their facilities to produce sanitizer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297714">Others retooled their production lines to manufacture respirators. A sewing cooperative in Montreal managed to recruit sewing enthusiasts to churn out thousands of masks. Individuals like my friend Daniel Carré used their own 3D printers to print face shields. Not only did the parties in the House work side by side, but the entire population joined in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297715">In terms of procurement, the contracting process was shortened to be able to meet demand promptly. Despite all the good will, there were shortcomings. We must learn from these shortcomings to avoid repeating them. We must protect our constituents’ health and our public finances. After all, we must never forget that the money we spend comes from somewhere, namely from the taxes paid by the public.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297716">Procurement is a complex process. It involves keeping a lot of balls in the air, because every government department and agency has needs that require contracts for goods and services to be negotiated with suppliers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297717">History has shown us that preferential treatment does happen in times of crisis and only gets found out once the crisis is over. We need to prevent this from happening. We need to maintain public trust in our institutions and in what we do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297718">What we need most, as I have said before, is personal protective equipment. I will not go through the whole list again. Every week, the members of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates held conference calls with Public Services and Procurement Canada to track the procurement process and ask questions. In particular, they wanted to know why we were not prioritizing Quebec and Canadian suppliers, and they were told that it was because of a lack of resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297719"> How can we access these resources? What is the plan for reducing our dependence on China? Why did two planes come back empty? Why are we receiving so much non-compliant PPE? Can it not be tested over there instead of over here? How many companies have procurement contracts right now? Why did two million masks sit in a warehouse until they were five years out of date? Why is there no plan for purchasing and restocking supplies?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297720">We have yet to get answers to some of these questions, even with a so-called “made in Canada” plan. It might be a good idea to have a “made in Canada” emergency plan. We have the innovation skills to pull it off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297721">To fight a virus, we need research on the virus's RNA, immune responses, treatments and vaccines. At the beginning of the pandemic, everyone agreed that we needed to ensure that industrialized countries did not monopolize access to the vaccine. Everyone agreed that if governments blindly invested public funds directly in private companies, it could result in a monopoly. Everyone agreed that the studies should be collaborative and should not lead to a new form of competition between countries. The boys' club culture among government leaders is getting tiresome. It used to be “my missile is bigger than yours”, and now it is “my country can produce a vaccine faster than yours”. Could we not all just work together for a change? That would be better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297722">Canada announced in April that it was going to invest in research for a homegrown vaccine. The day after this announcement, a company from British Columbia was given money. A committee was magically formed overnight, and no other company received money. Months went by before companies in Quebec and the other provinces got research grants to develop a vaccine. Meanwhile, contracts were being signed with foreign companies. Could we see those contracts? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297723">Let us talk about rapid testing. The government invested in a company that was supposed to produce rapid tests. However, if I remember correctly, the tests cost $8,000 apiece and had too big a margin of error. What is happening with that contract? Is the company still doing research? We do not know. We need rapid tests, and we just found out that we have 100,000 available. That is great, but that number of tests would last Ontario and Quebec just five days, and then that is it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297724">Now I will move on to respirators. A Canadian consortium was created to manufacture innovative, lower-cost respirators with fewer parts. What is happening with that project? We do not know. However, we did find out that two guys set up a company and became multimillionaires 10 days later. Forget the American dream, this is the Canadian dream. How many of us could set up a company and become multimillionaires 10 days later? Not many.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297725">I gave just a few examples, but I could go on for another 30 minutes. I am a teacher, so I am used to talking for an hour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297726">As I said, procurement is a big file, but it is also a hot topic. Procurement is where each and every procedural gap and error will stick out and every aspect of the process that needs to change will become obvious. This is the area where most scandals seem to come to light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297727">Quite frankly, my constituents and I have had quite enough of these scandals. We are sick of them. Like me, my constituents want us to act honestly and transparently. Not only are these values important to me, but they are what my constituents expect from me. I would hope that honesty and transparency are values that the government members and their constituents care about, too.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6297750">Madam Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues, I am honoured to speak to this motion as health critic for Canada's New Democrats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297751">I think there is broad agreement in the House that since early 2020, COVID has clearly been the number one public health issue facing the country. It is the most serious pandemic our world has faced in the last 100 years. It has profoundly affected the health of our population, costing some 10,000 Canadians their lives so far. It has profoundly affected the way our society operates and, of course, has caused unbelievable damage to our economy and the financial well-being of millions of Canadians. It has caused incredible dislocation and emotional, physical and social damage. It has also exposed pre-existing and serious deficiencies in our health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297752">In March, in the last session, the health committee started studying the COVID pandemic and the government's response to it, in broad terms. We were tasked with looking into any issue that related to COVID-19. We met twice per week, almost every week, until mid-July. We heard from many experts and stakeholders, some 170 witnesses: epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, public health officials, health professionals from every discipline, unions, emergency room specialists, researchers and international officials. What follows are some of the deficiencies the evidence revealed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297753">Canadians were horrified to see the appalling conditions in which many of our seniors in care lived. We witnessed a terrible spectre: 80% of the COVID-19 deaths in Canada were in Canada's long-term care homes. This is the highest percentage of deaths in long-term care of any nation in the OECD. This crisis was so severe that the army had to be called in to Ontario and Quebec. They detailed hundreds of examples of outrageously poor treatment of our seniors, ranging from poor nutrition to forced feeding to outright neglect. Seniors were left alone for hours, crying in pain, soaked in their own excrement, crammed four to a room with no proper infection control, being administered expired medication and dying alone without access to their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297754">This exposed the absolute precariousness, inefficiency and inequity of job-based health benefits. Millions of Canadians have seen their coverage for prescription medicine, dental services and ancillary health services of all kinds disappear. They join the tens of millions of Canadians who have never had coverage for the medicine their doctors prescribe and the dental care they desperately need. The government and all governments before it at the federal level have allowed this to develop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297755">The evidence also exposed a decade of inadequate planning by successive Conservative and Liberal governments to properly prepare Canada for a major health emergency. Indeed, Canadians were shocked to see our health professionals, our nurses, our care aides, our hospital staff and first responders have to go without basic personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves and gowns because there was a national shortage as a result of poor public health planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297756">We witnessed the government have to throw out over 2.5 million pieces of personal protective equipment because they were left to expire in a warehouse, the casualty of successive federal Conservative and Liberal governments that neglected to set up a proper inventory control management system for Canada's emergency stockpile of equipment. We faced the spectre of being caught without a sufficient number of ventilators, and narrowly dodged forcing our intensive care doctors to make the terrible choice that some countries had to make as to who did and who did not get access to life-saving intubation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297757">The evidence showed the negative effects of decades of neo-liberal trade policy that left Canada vulnerable and dependent on countries like China and Donald Trump's United States for basic medical supplies and equipment, made offshore by the cheapest manufacturers with no regard for the health threats this caused Canadian patients in their time of need. It revealed that the Liberal government inexplicably and irresponsibly dismantled Canada's excellent emergency early warning health system, the global public health intelligence network, just months before the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in Canada, costing us precious time, preparation and, in fact, the very lives of Canadians. It highlighted the totally misguided and poor public policy choice, first made by the Harper Conservative government, to limit federal health transfers to the provinces to 3% when actual health care costs in Canada rise by an average of 5.2% every year, causing a chronic and ever-worsening funding problem in our provincial health systems. This policy was adopted by the Liberal government, which had promised to do better but simply continued this damaging and dangerous health care underfunding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297758">Why is this motion before the House? Before adjourning in the summer, the health committee was preparing a report summarizing evidence and preparing recommendations to the government based on the excellent information we received. The government then prorogued Parliament in mid-August. This eliminated the health committee, along with all other committees, and wiped out all the evidence we had accumulated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297759">Upon returning to Parliament this September, we had to start from square one. We had a brand new throne speech. We had to reconstitute the committees. We had to re-elect the chairs and vice-chairs. We had to re-adopt the rules of the committees. We had to determine our new order of business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297760">I want to pause for a moment and mention the positive impact that the New Democrats have had on the throne speech from a health point of view. Through working with the government and using our leverage for Canadians, not our party interests, we successfully enlarged the Liberal plan to award paid sick days only to those with COVID-19 or awaiting diagnosis, giving them to all Canadians who have an underlying condition that may make them vulnerable to COVID-19. This brought the amount of Canadians receiving paid sick days from the thousands, the amount the Liberal plan would have helped, to millions, because of NDP work. This pleases me, particularly as health critic, because ensuring that Canadians can stay home from work when it is necessary for their health is a critically important health measure, and one that is especially important when we are dealing with an infectious disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297761">Because of the Liberal prorogation delay, since July and to this date, October 22, the health committee has met twice. For the record, as health critic for the NDP, I want to register my deep objection to the unnecessary and politically motivated prorogation, which was done transparently to cut off committee examination into various political scandals of the Liberal government, including the WE matter. I say this because in a global pandemic, every day, week and month matters. Canadians deserve and expect their political representatives to be focusing their attention on their health and economic needs, not on the partisan interests of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Liberal Party or his family. We have lost valuable time to do our important job as the House of Commons health committee not only to hold the government accountable for its decisions, but also to develop positive recommendations that can help it improve its delivery of health services to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297762">What happened at HESA in the last two meetings? The Liberals came to committee suggesting we study singular aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One was the impact purely on long-term care and the other was the impact purely on mental health, each as a separate study and limited to those issues. They did not deal whatsoever with the evidence that had been given so far this year, presumably leaving that evidence to wither on the vine. The Liberals also had no suggestions for the production of any documents that may aid the committee in its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297763"> On behalf of the NDP, I served notice of three motions, proposing a study of the following, in this order. First I proposed to continue our study of COVID-19, adopting all of the evidence we heard in 2020, so that we did not lose this vital and valuable information. I proposed that we continue on with our COVID-19 study, unlimited in scope, and focus on any and all issues of concern now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297764">I also proposed that we did not need to go over already well-tilled areas, and that instead we should focus on the most important and productive things for preserving and protecting Canadians' health now. These are things such as the following: Where are we with vaccine development and access for Canadians? What is the distribution protocol for vaccines going to be? What is the status of potential treatment therapies for those with COVID-19? This is especially important in case we do not soon develop a vaccine. Why was the GPHIN dismantled by the Liberals, and more importantly, what is the status of this vital early warning system now? What considerations and resources are needed to deal with the second wave, which is clearly upon us, and maybe a third wave in the new year? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297765">What is the status of testing and contact tracing? We have heard repeatedly that both are essential components of any successful battle plan against transmission of the virus. How can we develop safe protocols to help reunite families that have been cruelly separated for many months? How can we best utilize the best science and evidence-based advice, whether it is from global health organizations, other countries or within Canada? I propose this as the first order of business for the health committee as the COVID crisis is without doubt the most important health issue gripping our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297766">Incidentally, I also served notice of two other important areas that I believe we need to study after we complete our COVID examination, whenever that may be. The first is universal dental care as an insured service for every Canadian, because some 12 million Canadians do not have any dental coverage whatsoever. Many more have substandard coverage for an aspect of our health that has been ignored and treated as a private matter for the wealthy or those who can afford it for far too long. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297767">I also proposed we study indigenous health because indigenous people rank among the lowest in virtually every major metric of health. This is a statistic that ought to cause all parliamentarians to hang our heads in shame. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297768">Procedurally, I tendered two motions to request the production of documents to the committee. These concerned necessary documents to help us understand the very secretive activities of the Liberal-appointed vaccine task force, a body that is filled with a mixture of industry and corporate representatives who have not disclosed their conflicts of interest, even as they make recommendations to the government for specific vaccine investments. The other motion concerned details about the government's plan on how it intends to roll out vaccines for Canadians, if and when they become available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297769">I will also note my disappointment that the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> has refused to answer my question in this House on whether vaccines will be made available at no cost to Canadians. The NDP believes this ought to be the case on the grounds of social justice and public health. The Conservatives tabled a motion very similar to that in the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297770">What happened at committee? The Liberals stalled consideration of this motion, arguing, in turn, that it is too broad or not inclusive enough. They have not made up their minds. They adamantly refused to consider any production of documents of any kind to the committee whatsoever, arguing mainly that their government and public servants are much too busy to be bothered to gather this information for Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297771">They used the valuable time of the health committee during a pandemic to filibuster debate by talking out the clock to avoid any vote on this motion, which they knew a majority of committee members and parties, namely, the Conservatives, the Bloc and the NDP, supported. Therefore, nothing was done at either of the first two health committee meetings in any substantive manner because the Liberals refused to respect the will of the majority of the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297772">I will point out at this point some important facts. First, we are in a minority Parliament. In 2019, Canadians, in their wisdom, saw fit to give no party a majority claim on power. This means that it is the Canadian people's democratic determination and expectation that we work together and seek a majority across party lines. No one party can have a veto in this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297773">Second, this Parliament requires co-operation among the parties and parliamentarians. Canadians want us to make this Parliament work. They expect us to put down our partisan guards, at least to some extent, and make the necessary compromises that reason and fairness dictate. Therefore, I and my NDP colleagues intend to support this motion because it represents the will of the majority of members of the health committee. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297774">We support it because it places COVID where it should be, which is as the health committee's number one priority. I support it because it would allow the committee to focus our attention in any area we deem most helpful and important, just like we did in the first session. It would provide each party with an equal number of witnesses at every meeting, ensuring that balanced and diverse viewpoints are heard and every committee member could call witnesses in the area they want to delve into. It would also allow each party to provide witnesses in the area they want highlighted, whether it is rapid testing, mental health, long-term care or vaccine development. All of these are priorities identified by each of the parties at committee, including the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297775">The motion would give the committee access to documents that are reasonable and necessary to hold the government to account in a responsible manner. On this latter point of disclosure of documents, the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pledged to Canadians, upon being elected in 2015, his government would be “open by default”. He said that he would unmuzzle scientists and civil servants. The Prime Minister promised that his government would be transparent and would not utilize the tools of secrecy and redaction that had become the hallmark of the Harper government that came before him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297776">How times change. We have seen far too many examples of this pledge being broken by the Liberal government, which now routinely refuses to produce documents, heavily redacts them and violates instructions to have redactions performed by parliamentary counsel instead of ministry officials. This must stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297777">Committees have the powerful duty and right to order production of documents in unredacted or properly redacted form. This is a long-standing and crucial power of committees in a responsible and democratic government. It is essential to hold the government accountable. When a government refuses to disclose documents or heavily redacts them, as has unfortunately become routine practice by the Liberal government to avoid political embarrassment, it does much more than damage its own reputation. It tarnishes the authority of Parliament itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297778">Contrary to what the Liberals have argued and will likely claim today, disclosure of documents to Parliament is not a burden or an inconvenience for public officials that is provided only when convenient or in times of insignificance. It is a core, important and full-time duty that applies at all times to all responsible and honest governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297779">I note this motion would permit redaction for proper grounds such as national security, personal privacy, and in the case of the vaccine task force, to protect the integrity of contractual and other negotiations that may have taken place. I believe we are prepared to entertain further amendments if the Liberals propose reasonable ones in this regard. These document disclosures constitute reasonable and responsible requests that are targeted and rational for the health committee to review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297780">In summary, my NDP colleagues and I will proudly support this motion while being somewhat regretful that this matter had to be elevated to the House. I would like to thank my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> for her initiative in moving this motion today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297781">I look forward to working with her and all my colleagues on the health committee for the benefit of all Canadians. We do so because the health of Canadians is our paramount concern, and the integrity of Parliament, underpinned by the values of transparency, accountability, democracy and good governments, demands it.</ParaText>

I do believe in the Canada Health Act's principles of ensuring that each Canadian in this country gets access to relatively similar levels of health. The federal government can set basic general standards to ensure the money transferred to the provinces is in fact used for those purposes, We can then leave it to the provinces to determine the best way to deliver those services. We do not want to be sending money to Alberta—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297817">Before I get into the basis of my intervention today, I found it interesting to listen to the arguments from the Liberal Party when our <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> opened this debate. I find hearing the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> say that it is irresponsible for the Liberal government to change its tactics in the middle of a battle to be, in short, completely ridiculous. I am very happy that Sir Julian Byng and Arthur Currie did not have that same perspective and were not like the Liberals. When the Battle of Vimy Ridge was going on, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers were dying, they invented the rolling barrage in the middle of the battle to win Vimy Ridge. I would ask the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to rethink her position on this and maybe start thinking of <I>The Art of War</I> by Sun Tzu and not Colonel Custer when she is putting the lives of Canadians at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297818">Also, we have many Liberal members saying that this motion is going to open up trade secrets with corporations and agreements that have been made with corporate Canada. It is interesting that just a couple of days ago there was an interim order granting the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> the authority, or new powers, to request documents from corporations and drug companies in Canada when it comes to COVID-19. The hypocrisy of that is ridiculous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297819">Why was the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> here arguing today that we should not be asking for government documents because they are not important, while at the same time she is giving herself new powers to do the exact same thing to Canadian corporations and drug companies? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297820">When the Liberals argue that asking for these documents is going to put those agreements in the public eye, she is going to be doing the exact same thing. The hypocrisy of this, I find, is quite ridiculous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297821">In my discussions with my constituents, they want a strategy. They want to see a plan from the Liberal government on how we are going to deal with COVID and the pandemic. When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued, it was the last step in what has been a very predictable process. When Canadians needed their elected officials and were relying on us the most to deal with one of the biggest threats we have had in a generation, this pandemic, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> first shut down Parliament, then he prorogued Parliament. Now we are finally back and he is filibustering committees: ethics, finance and now health. Then, when he is not getting his way, he threatens an election in the middle of a pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297822">When we went through prorogation, the whole idea was to have a reset, and that we would come back and have a clear vision of where Canada was going. We have seen none of that. We have wasted months of Parliament's time getting nowhere. All that we saw in the throne speech was a rehash of broken Liberal promises. We have seen nothing about a plan to access vaccines. We have seen nothing about a plan to access rapid testing. The only thing that we have seen from the Liberal government this far is planning an additional round of closures for businesses across Canada. Our economy cannot afford that. We cannot afford for closure to be the only alternative, especially knowing that there are other alternatives that jurisdictions around the world are using. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297823">Germany, Japan, Austria and Iceland are all using rapid testing technology and reducing quarantine times to keep their businesses open, to keep schools open, to keep families united, to keep regions and communities connected, and to ensure that they can resurrect their airline and tourism industries. However, in Canada, we are falling well behind other jurisdictions around the world. We are using a 14-day quarantine that most of our partners are not using. In fact, more than 80 countries around the world are using this new technology, but Canada is not among them. It is very difficult for us to go back to our constituents and say, “You know what? Other countries have that technology.” We do not have to rely on a 14-day quarantine or closures. Most businesses will not survive a second closure. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297824">How do we look them in the face and say we could be using this rapid testing technology or even home-based testing, but we prefer not to? That is absolutely out of touch with what is going on in our communities. I will give a quick example. In my riding, as I know many of my colleagues have done, we started what we call the Foothills recovery task force. We surveyed hundreds of businesses in my riding. We wanted to be a one-stop shop for them to come to with questions: to be a resource, when it came to federal and provincial programs, so that they knew what was available to them. What I found very interesting was that, when we surveyed these businesses, fewer than 30% of them could access, or were eligible for, federal programs like the emergency business program, the wage subsidy or even the rent subsidy, which we know has been an absolute failure. For months, the Liberals have been promising to change these programs to make them more broadly accessible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297825">That is not what is happening in my rural southern Alberta riding, where these businesses cannot access these programs. What they need is the ability to stay open, keep their workers employed, keep their business doors open and keep food on their families' tables. Rapid testing is one perfect example of a way for us to accomplish that. When that technology is being used in other countries and not here in Canada, I question that. That is really the basis of what the motion is today. We want to look at what got us here. What decisions did the Liberal government make to get us to this point? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297826">We can use that as a starting point of where to go from here. What vaccine technology has been reviewed? How close are we to rapid testing? How close are we to home-based testing? What has been the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Canadians? Those are the things that we want to discuss, which are quite prudent at the health committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297827">What have we been faced with? Thus far, we have been faced with ridiculous filibustering by Liberal members at the health committee. We have heard that it is too much work for them to go through all these documents: that they want their Thanksgiving weekend and really do not want to have to do this right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297828">Do those members of the health committee realize why they are here? They were elected by their constituents to come to the House of Commons, get their hands dirty and go to work. Yes, if we have to spend a weekend or a long night session reading documents that are pertinent to the health and safety of Canadians, damn right. That is what we have been sent here to do, and no excuses are good enough for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297829">Two other members of the Liberal Party at the health committee said the font of the motions was too small and they could not read them. Are they kidding? Are they serious? Zoom in. They say it is going to take too long for our public sector workers to be able to access these documents. I have a lot of pride in what our public sector workers have done through COVID-19 and the response that they have had. Some of these programs could take months if not years to develop and roll out, but they have done it in sometimes days or hours. I applaud them for that. However, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, and it does not take that long to type “search” into our computers and press print. That is what we are asking the public sector workers to do on this file. I understand it is a big job, but I am willing to do the job of reviewing these documents. It is absolutely not right for the Liberals to block this information that is crucial to Canadians. It is crucial that we keep our businesses open and resurrect our airline industry. What is clear, for example, is that rapid testing gives us a pathway to economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297830">In closing, I find it extremely frustrating that the Liberals are blocking this important debate, discussion and review at the health committee, but it seems to be that the government's hostility to the truth is only matched by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s penchant for ethics and corruption violations.</ParaText>

I would be putting it out there for everyone to see and say, “Look at what I have done.” If that is the case and the documents come back, and we read them and see that we are on the right track, then that is fine.</ParaText>

It was decided that funding would be left at the federal government's discretion. In 2004, former prime minister Paul Martin decided there needed to be a minimum, a floor that he set at a 6% annual increase. That was in effect from 2004 to 2017. Since 2017, the increase has been tied to the growth rate of GDP and subject to a floor of 3%. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6297850">Mr. Speaker, that was an excellent speech by my colleague from Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297851">Essentially, he told us that our most important job here in the House is to be here for Canadians and implement effective measures to fight the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297852">That is exactly what we are talking about today. Basically, the motion before us is asking the Standing Committee on Health to do everything it can to ensure that the government's response works. We have to implement effective measures to fight the pandemic and be transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297853">The issue we are tackling today is the lack of transparency and effective measures to fight the pandemic. Would every member agree that we are here in Parliament to make sure the government helps businesses?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297854">One such business is Autocar Excellence in Bellechasse, which has some beautiful brand-new buses in Bellechasse but cannot use them for obvious reasons. Another is Prevost in Sainte-Claire, maker of those very buses, for which demand is very low now that we are in the second wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297855">Our role is to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, especially on health. The Standing Committee on Health has important work to do, and that is what we are asking of it today. Unfortunately, it appears that the Liberals are trying to hide something. If they are so proud of how they have handled the pandemic, they should open up the books so we can see what we can improve and how.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297856">The fact is, when the Conservatives sounded the alarm back in January about what lay ahead, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> said that closing the border would not be a very effective tool for fighting the pandemic, and yet that is how the virus first got here, across the border. From day one, the government has been caught with its pants down, as we like to say back home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297857">What we want is to be able to respond better. In the first wave, the measures that were implemented were improvised and took away Canadians' motivation to stay at work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297858">The Liberals then started giving contracts to their friends. Yesterday, we had a vote on the WE Charity scandal. When the Liberals felt things starting to heat up at committee, they shut down Parliament and the finance minister resigned. Yesterday, they made the ultimate threat that they would trigger a general election. As my colleague stated, the Liberals were willing to hold an election to cover up a scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297859">We want to dig deep by demanding transparency and dealing with the pandemic efficiently. That is our job as parliamentarians. From the Bloc Québécois to the NDP, MPs are saying today that they want to work together to ensure that the government's response is effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297860">In its throne speech this fall, the government listed many priorities. Once again, however, it was all over the map, with no clear proposals and nothing about efficient testing measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297861">We want efficient testing. Right now, people are being diagnosed with COVID-19 and having to stay home. The faster we can identify these cases, the faster they can go back to contributing to the economy. I am thinking of parents in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297862">No one is talking about all the indirect effects of the pandemic, such as loneliness among seniors and many other people. That is why the government must adopt the most effective response possible. We Conservatives and the members of the other opposition parties are prepared to make the effort to implement effective measures. Unfortunately, as I was saying, we are up against the less than transparent Liberal Party, which appears to have something to hide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297863">This week, it was reported that friends of the Liberal Party obtained contracts to supply medical equipment at almost twice the going rate. We understand why the Liberals would want to hide these types of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297864">There are lives at stake, and there are also colossal amounts being invested in the fight against the pandemic. That is one more reason why we should be vigilant and implement effective measures. The Liberals' mismanagement of the pandemic makes the opposition’s work all the more important.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297865">Unfortunately, the parties' hands are tied because the Liberals seem to be hiding something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297866">In today's motion, we are calling for effective tools. Alberta, Quebec and the other provinces need targeted measures, such as testing, effective vaccines or treatments, so that their floundering health care systems can meet this challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297867">Back when the Liberals were saying that there was no danger, they sent PPE to China. That is pretty outrageous. They sent hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and gowns from our stockpile to another country. A few weeks or months later, we had a shortage. On top of that, we used to have an early pandemic alert system, but it was shut down before the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297868">Not only did the government not have the right tools in place, but it also implemented measures that turned out to be counterproductive. That is why it is important to let the Standing Committee on Health do its job. Starting now, how can we work constructively to make sure the government's pandemic response is effective and supports businesses, families, the health care system and the provinces?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297869">We think keeping the border closed is important. Once again this week, American billionaires came over to hang out in COVID-19 hot spots. How could Canada's <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> let these people in and put others in danger, when Canadians are being told to stay home, limit their activities, and self-isolate when they return to the country? We do not want a double standard. These are legitimate questions that opposition members are asking themselves. We want answers from the government, but it is like talking to a brick wall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297870">When it comes to mask wearing, the government initially said that it might not be effective. In fact, the government actually advised against wearing masks, but we now know that wearing a mask gives us the best chances to stay safe. In fact, what we want to do at the Standing Committee on Health is give ourselves the best chances to have effective measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297871">We want to speed up testing. I will come back to that because it is important. As my colleague was saying, many countries have a host of mechanisms to allow people to get a quick diagnosis and take the necessary measures when they have reason to believe they contracted COVID-19. Time is money, as the saying goes. The government's slow response is costing us a lot of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297872">I am asking my Liberal colleagues if they are prepared to work with us on fighting the pandemic and taking effective measures. We are prepared to do the work. We are reaching out to the government and saying, let's work together. These are exceptional times. We are in a health crisis. It is time to pull together, work together and have a Parliament that works.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297895">Today, I am giving my comments on a hyper-partisan motion from our Conservative colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297896">I am proud to have sat on the health committee since the beginning of the pandemic. The committee has been working hard studying COVID-19 and the government's response. Since January, the health committee has held 34 meetings and heard from 171 witnesses as part of its study on COVID-19. The motion's goal is not to continue the good work for Canadians, but to send our health committee down a road of never-ending, counterproductive work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297897">The opposition says they are acting in the best interests of Canadians. However, in speaking about the motion, this is what the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> has to say to her Facebook audience. I am going to read the titles of the member's Facebook videos before speaking about the health committee. I want to see if members can get the tone she is conveying to her audience. She posts a video about a “Snap election alert” with a link to her website. Then she adds another “Snap election update”, another “snap election update” and then finally, a full election alert titled “Confidence motion on Trudeau scandal—full breakdown on what’s happening in Ottawa!!!!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297898">I am hearing the member opposite say we should work shoulder to shoulder. We are ready to work shoulder to shoulder for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297899">I ask all those listening, “What is the member concerned about?” If the Conservatives were really concerned about long-term care or even health transfers to the provinces, they would present studies on these specific topics at the health committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297900">The members of the party opposite continue to be focused on political games. On this side of the House, we are focused on Canadians. As many members in the House have said previously, what happened in our long-term care homes in the first wave of COVID-19 was without a doubt a tragedy. I think the majority of the House would agree with that fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297901">This is why I am disappointed that this motion only briefly mentioned long-term care homes, among a wide range of 16 other topics. When the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> brought the motion to the Standing Committee on Health, it was disappointing to see long-term care referenced among 16 other topics. What happened in our long-term care homes deserves its own separate study at the health committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297902">The motion would send the health committee on a never-ending study to look at issues that are most important in the member's riding. Many members are concerned about that. However, maybe for some members of the Conservative Party this is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297903">From our very first meeting, the Liberals at committee came forward with a motion to study the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, and my motion is to study its impact on long-term care. While respecting provincial jurisdictions, we want to continue to get good work done for Canadians on committee. This unreasonable motion does not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297904">The conditions reported by the Canadian Armed Forces in five long-term care homes in Ontario are deeply concerning and disturbing. One of these long-term care homes is located in my community of Brampton South. What we are seeing is the result of a pattern of neglect of long-term care facilities in Ontario. There is no excuse for the conditions that were reported. A lack of proper use of personal protective equipment, mistreatment of residents and poor facility conditions are unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297905">I would like to thank the CAF for their service to Canada and their bravery in coming forward with this report. It is up to us as elected officials to be part of the solution to this problem. Over 80% of all COVID-19-related deaths happened in long-term care homes. Our seniors deserve so much better than what they got.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297906">Some homes saw over one-third of their residents pass away. Over 1,900 seniors died during the first wave in long-term care homes in Ontario alone. This is not to say that all long-term care facilities are bad. In fact, there are many excellent facilities across the country. Deaths in Ontario have occurred in only 60% of the homes, and half of all deaths occurred in just 23 homes across the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297907">It is about figuring out what went wrong in the homes that had COVID-19 deaths, in many cases while respecting provincial jurisdictions, which my motion at the health committee acknowledges. It is extremely important to analyze how we can better protect our seniors in the future. The federal government and I, as a member of Parliament, have no interest in stepping on the toes of the provinces when it comes to long-term care. This has been a long-standing issue, and COVID-19 has presented a moment where all of us can step up and say, “No. We will no longer allow seniors to receive less than they deserve.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297908">Now we are being hit with the second wave. We are seeing cases start to trickle into long-term care homes once again. Experts are ringing alarm bells once again:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297911">There have been 40 COVID deaths in Ontario long-term care homes over the past month. Last week alone, seven people in long-term care died as a result of COVID-19. This issue is not going away and highlights the importance for the health committee to give this issue the study it deserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297912">I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the heroes working in long-term care homes. I thank them for going above and beyond to support our dear long-term care residents. During these challenging times, Canadians are grateful for the work that is being done to protect our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297913"> With that being said, we have all heard about the staffing shortage in Ontario and across the country. This issue must be studied to ensure we can avoid any tragic situation like what happened in the spring. This is a provincial jurisdiction, but, as our government has said before, we are all in this together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297914"> Some provinces have been proactive about this issue, and that is great to see. From the very beginning, we have seen provinces take different approaches to keeping residents in long-term care homes safe. For example, the Province of Quebec launched a recruitment drive in June to hire and train thousands of staff members and a manager for each long-term care home to oversee the COVID-19 response. It would be beneficial to learn from experts in Quebec and other provinces and to hear what actions they are taking to safeguard long-term care homes as we endure the second wave of COVID-19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297915">COVID-19 is also having a serious impact on the mental health of Canadians. Loneliness is taking a toll on Canadians. The latest finding from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health is that a substantial portion of the population is coping with a mental health issue. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253010" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>, presented a motion at the committee to study the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and well-being of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297916">This silent pandemic is another issue that I have heard about from many constituents. In my riding of Brampton South, one constituent of mine, Michelle, has two elderly parents in long-term care homes and has been advocating for change in these homes ever since the start of this pandemic. She has worked with other families in similar situations and even secured 70,000 signatures on a petition, asking for all governments to take action. People like Michelle are counting on us to do the right thing by their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297917"> While one small aspect of this motion commits to looking at long-term care in some capacity, this issue deserves its own study by the health committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297936">Madam Speaker, since the beginning of the pandemic, the Standing Committee on Health has worked long hours to ensure that we heard from stakeholders across Canada on the government's response to the outbreak of COVID-19. I am proud of the work we have accomplished and I am especially proud of the way committee members were able to work together collaboratively to do our jobs and support Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297937">A lot has changed since then. While claims have been made on intentions to collaborate, there has been no action to prove it. I am frustrated and disappointed in the Conservatives' new approach on the health committee. We did not always agree before, but it was always clear that everyone on the committee had a common goal to be productive rather than play partisan games. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297938">The motion before us today sets out 16 areas of study and six requests for the production of papers, again 16 areas of study. This will prevent the committee from doing a proper study on any of these issues, looking at key issues and hearing from important witnesses across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297939">Earlier this year, in over 34 meetings of the health committee, we heard from 171 witnesses and received 51 informative briefs covering many important issues. However, only one of the 34 meetings that we held over the spring and summer focused on mental health. While it was enough to open our eyes, it was certainly not enough for us to get a better understanding of the situation we were facing relative to the mental health of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297940">With this in mind, when we met again on October 9, I introduced a motion to the committee to study the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health and well-being of Canadians, including recommendations to specifically look at the impacts on indigenous peoples, racialized Canadians and vulnerable populations, the effectiveness and availability of virtual mental health services and how our government could assist the provinces and territories. I was disappointed when my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> moved to adjourn debate on this study, without so much as an opportunity for us to discuss its importance, so her motion could be introduced, but not before saying:</ParaText>

I try not to put my personal life into the public domain, but as somebody who is separated from her family due to COVID-19 measures, I understand the impact on mental health of some of these measures. Talking to other people who are in situations similar to mine, I know that's tough, and that's just one group of people. There are people who have lost their jobs or who are experiencing domestic violence or mental health breakdowns. It's certainly something that I think is important for our committee to look at. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6297943"> In the motion before us today, that number is zero. That is unacceptable, but apparently that is how important my colleague sees mental health to be, not even worthy of mention. While I appreciate the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> finding encouragement in my motion, I wish I could say the same for the one that was presented in committee and the one that is being debated today. In fact, I am actually discouraged by these motions and their complete disregard for Canadians during these challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297944">There is no doubt that COVID-19 has been one of the greatest challenges we have ever faced. Across the country, we are hearing lots of anecdotal evidence about the increased risk that some people may have in terms of depression, psychological distress, substance abuse and PTSD surfacing as a result of the pandemic. Many experts have labelled this mental health situation as a second pandemic, that is how serious it is. However, there is no doubt that mental health needs to be a priority for all of us right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297945">We need an informed strategy on mental health going forward and, most important, we need to act while we have time before this crisis becomes worse. I am by no means suggesting that this is the only good idea, much less the only key issue, surfacing from the pandemic. The essence of committee work and of compromise is to work as a team in the best interests of Canadians in setting priorities to study.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297946">What we have found in front of us today is a motion that sets out 16 areas of study and six requests for the production of papers. A general, all-encompassing motion such as this one takes away the opportunity for the committee to properly focus on priority areas like the ones recommended by the 171 witnesses we heard earlier this year. One of the strengths of smaller studies is that we are able to make well-informed, targeted recommendations that will have a real impact on the lives of Canadians. A scope as large as 16 areas of study waters down our ability to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297947">I am genuinely concerned that out of the 16 areas of study before us today, there is not a single mention of looking at the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health and well-being of Canadians. This is unacceptable. I also do not see a mention of looking at the impacts of the pandemic on high-risk groups, such as indigenous people, racialized Canadians and vulnerable populations. We need to consider these groups so we can develop programs to effectively help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297948">As I have said before and will say again, if we have too many priorities, 16 to be exact, we have no priorities at all. Do members want to know what is not a priority in the motion presented today? The mental health of Canadians during these challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297949">I will not be supporting the motion and I hope my colleagues will follow suit. All members in the House have an opportunity to get ahead of the second pandemic, but what is being proposed today will not get us there. If we do not take the appropriate steps to act now, while we can, the outcome will be on all of us and especially on those who choose to move forward without giving this matter the attention it deserves. This second pandemic cannot be fixed with a vaccine, but we can get ahead of it if we collaborate and focus our work on how we can best support Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6297962">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297963">It is a pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to our opposition day motion and to, frankly, agree with the government. It has said it wants to talk about the response to the pandemic and talk about COVID-19 to help Canadians in every part of the country get through these challenging times. However, I have been listening with interest as Liberals come up with every reason they possibly can not to support our looking into the government's COVID-19 response. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297964">I want to thank our shadow health minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, for her fantastic work on this issue. The Liberals are trolling her Facebook page for quotes and coming up with reasons not to support her, but she is idolized on this side of the House. Apparently she is even idolized on the government side, as they have been tracking her every move these last few days. I think that speaks volumes about the need to be back in Parliament to ask tough questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297965">In my previous work, before becoming a member of Parliament, I proudly served as the mayor for the township of North Dundas, which is just south of Ottawa, and on the United Council of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. I know what it is like to have to govern. A key part of all municipal work is scrutiny and accountability, and that is required when we make tough decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297966">Yes, we are in challenging times and our party and this Parliament have responded by helping Canadians get the assistance they need. However, a key part of being on the opposition benches is asking tough questions, scrutinizing and getting the information that Canadians deserve. Remember, never before have we seen this amount of money go out in the period of time we have seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297967">We are now into the second wave, and I am pleased to support this motion, which looks at how to get through the second wave and help Canadians. As I said last night when doing some media interviews and talking to constituents on the phone back home, this motion helps us move forward and improves our response to COVID-19 by going back and looking into the expenditures and the way things were done. The health committee is the appropriate spot for this. I also agree with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> that we have to bring this to the floor of the House of Commons, because the Liberals are filibustering on COVID-19 at the health committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297968">We need to scrutinize and we need to get the documents, but not just the documents the government wants us to take a look at. We need all documents that are relevant for us to make an assessment and do an analysis, going through the law clerk and through a procedure, and making sure of that. Yes, there is quite a long list of documents being requested, but hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent in the last seven months. This is what Parliament is for. This is our job as the opposition. We work together where we can but also scrutinize and get answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297969">I can say Bill Morneau's name now in the House because he is not here anymore. We have seen a key theme: filibustering. It was nothing to see here, nothing to do. A few months later, the former finance minister saw a different path and now he is no longer the finance minister for Canada or the member for Toronto Centre, which is in the midst of a by-election. It is when the opposition gets the opportunity to ask tough questions, dig and scrutinize that we can get the truth out, not the rosy picture that we always see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297970">One thing I want to focus my comments on today is rapid testing. We have been asking lots of questions on this in question period, and the media has been picking up this issue. Most importantly, Canadians are realizing it. What the heck is happening with rapid testing? It is a massive failure on the government's part, for small businesses, parents, students and everybody else. It has been months and months since COVID-19 hit us here at home. We have worked with countries around the world, such as Japan, Germany, the U.K. and the United States, in sharing national intelligence, for example. We have a good working relationship with them on this matter, but when it comes to looking at approvals for rapid testing, they approved rapid testing months ago and tests are nowhere to be found in Canada. We are months behind. The Conservatives are rightfully asking about what has gone wrong. Why are we months behind? When we share intelligence information with those countries, why can we not share some of the health best practices in this serious economic and health crisis we are facing?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6297971">We need all hands on deck, we need to get access to the information, and we need to be able to pressure this government to treat this issue with the urgency that it deserves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297972">When I speak in the House, I always try to bring a context of Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry into the chamber, and I want to share the story of Krista and Mike O'Neill from O'Neill's Pub in Long Sault. Our eastern Ontario health unit had been contemplating for the past few days reverting to stage 2 in our region. The outcry from businesses was very emotional and overwhelming, and Mike and Krista posted on their Facebook page of O'Neill's Pub. I printed it off last night, and there were 1,200 shares and counting. It was talking about the desperation and frustration that small businesses like their restaurant are facing. If we go back, and if they cannot keep their doors open, they are panicking and worried about going bankrupt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297973">I just want to make sure that I put into the record an acknowledgement of their work, effort and stress and also note that while the testing, the testing sites and the response on the front lines is handled at the provincial level, it is Health Canada that has not delivered good options to businesses like O'Neill's Pub in Long Sault. If they had access to rapid-testing options, like many other advanced countries did months ago, they could have that tool at their disposal to test their employees every day to build an even better case of staying open and staying in business. That is the contrast that people are facing and it is the frustration people are facing, because this technology, these advancements and this whole process has not been there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297974">We have seen lineups of cars miles long in eastern Ontario in Casselman. In Winchester, the assessment centre for the testing model saw 1,000 phone calls on a Friday morning when the wave hit. It is not sustainable the way the government is operating these testing options and approvals. We want to get access to those documents. We want to see what they did, frankly, what they did not do, to get a proper process in place to make a tangible difference as we get through the second wave. I look forward to getting those answers and asking those tough questions for the betterment of a wide variety of people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297975"> I mentioned the restaurant industry in my riding. I think of the Glen Stor Dun Lodge in Cornwall or the Hartford Retirement Residence in Morrisburg. If they had access to rapid testing now, like many other countries have and have done approvals, I think they would feel a lot more comfortable in the coming months as we get into this second wave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297976">I also want to touch on the frustration I have with the line of this <I>Kumbaya </I>approach that I have heard from the government the last little while: We work with provinces and territories and all the stakeholders, and it is all wonderful. There has been progress. Our colleagues here on this side of the House have supported where need be, but I also want to highlight that when it comes to rapid testing, there are far from pleasant reviews from our provincial partners on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297977">The Government of Manitoba had issued a press release begging the federal government to not block their work on rapid testing to help the province out. To have to beg for that through a news release in the news media does not symbolize to me a good, collaborative working relationship that is set on good communication. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6297978">About a month ago, I quoted the Premier of Ontario who talked about the rapid-testing failure. He was doing an event in Huntsville speaking with passion about the frustration on the delays that he had with Health Canada. I just want to read this into the record and make sure that Canadians see that it is not all rosy, it is not all perfect. There are tough questions that need to be asked. </ParaText>

Has Canada contemplated doing the same thing, asking all people returning from China to self-isolate for two weeks?” Remember, that was February 3. What a great question. Sadly the answer he received was that the government was only recommending people limit their contact with others if they had visited Hubei province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298015">I am starting to wonder whether, if the member for <Affiliation DbId="253112" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation> was our health minister, we could have been far better prepared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298016">The other issue in our motion that I want to speak to is our efforts to get more information and how the government responded and is continuing to respond to the issue of purchasing COVID-19 test products. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298017">As many have heard, we still do not have widespread access to rapid test kits. Just yesterday, the government announced it had gotten its first shipment, but we still do not have any idea where they are going. Now we have heard some conflicting words from the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> on rapid tests. For a government that just purchased 100,000 of them, why did the minister say, just a couple of weeks ago, “many jurisdictions that have used rapid tests in that way have seen a worsening of their outbreaks”? She went on to say that “around the world there are very high-profile examples of how rapid tests have actually added confusion and increased the risk of infection.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298018">These are not words from a pundit. They come from the one person in the country who is supposed to be in charge of the federal government's COVID-19 response. While the minister may think Canadians are not paying attention to what is said in this place, I can assure her they are. It is very disconcerting that, while the government is seemingly getting around to approving and purchasing rapid test kits after much pressure, the minister is sewing doubt about whether they can be trusted. That in itself is very troubling. I question whether the minister said those words because she did not like the questions posed to her from the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, or if her officials told her to say that. Who knows? However, I want to get to the bottom of it. </ParaText>

Most of all, we have taken a co-operative, team Canada approach, one that I humbly submit is not reflected in the motion that we are debating here today.

              <ParaText id="6298043">A significant part of our government's action to meet the challenges of this crisis has involved procuring the essential supplies that Canadians need to protect themselves against COVID-19. Our government, through the hard work of procurement officials, has worked incredibly hard over these last few months to put in place a solid strategy to get supplies into the hands of those who need them the most. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them and to highlight some of those efforts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298046">Since the beginning of the pandemic, Public Services and Procurement Canada officials have been working around the clock to procure personal protective equipment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298047">This equipment includes masks, N95 respirators, face shields and hand sanitizer as well as protective gowns and gloves. In total, we have acquired more than 2 billion pieces of personal protective equipment and we continue to receive more every day. We are making every effort to procure the materials needed to administer COVID-19 tests, including test kits, swabs and reagents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298048">To obtain such huge quantities in such a short period of time, our government has taken a two-pronged approach. At the beginning of the pandemic, we faced a volatile market amid scarce resources and fierce global competition. We had to be aggressive in our procurement efforts, often with new suppliers. We also had to create new supply chains and sort out warehousing and shipping logistics, all while making sure that all products meet Health Canada standards.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6298049">Second, as we continued to deal with firms overseas, we also turned to domestic manufacturers and suppliers. We issued a call to action to Canadian businesses, and thousands of them responded. These companies stepped up to contribute to the national effort and retooled their assembly lines to design entirely new products, so that we could establish secure supply chains right here in Canada. This unprecedented mobilization of domestic manufacturing not only helped to save lives but also helped to keep people employed and contributing to our economy when this country needed it the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298050">Because of our strategy, more than 40% of the dollar value of our contracts is for made-in-Canada goods, like surgical gowns, non-surgical masks, face shields and hand sanitizer. These domestic suppliers significantly add to the regular shipments of personal protective equipment that we continue to receive from overseas and will do so for months to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298052">I can assure the House that the government is working hard to get ready for that. Once we have approved vaccines, we can start vaccinating Canadians from coast to coast to coast. We had to be aggressive in sourcing PPE domestically and abroad, and now we have to be aggressive in negotiating access to potential vaccines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298053">Once again, Canada has to navigate a volatile market. We have to be ready for the unexpected. Even though we do not yet know which vaccines will be successful in clinical trials and get approval, we cannot stand by and wait. That is why we are making vaccine procurement decisions based on the advice and recommendations of the COVID-19 vaccine task force and on the latest scientific evidence.</ParaText>

Moreover, the government continues to negotiate additional agreements with both domestic and international supplies to establish a guaranteed supply of a potential vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298055">We know that with renewed efforts to keep community transmission at a minimum, testing for the virus and tracing where it may have spread is more important than ever. To that end, we are pursuing rapid test solutions to help us meet urgent demands from provinces and territories to reduce wait times for results. This is key to reducing the spread of the virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298056">In addition to these bilateral agreements made directly with pharmaceutical companies, we are also collaborating with our global partners to fight the virus. Our government is investing in the Gavi COVAX Facility, a pooled procurement mechanism for purchasing COVID-19 vaccines and allowing them to be distributed equitably around the world. This pandemic cannot be fought at the domestic level alone. We know that in order to come out the other side, we need to do our part to protect other countries as well.</ParaText>

Since there is a global shortage of the supplies we are procuring and we are competing with other governments, it has not always been possible to immediately disclose certain confidential details about the contracts. That remains the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298058">In any event, I am pleased to inform the House that we have taken various measures to disclose as much information as possible. For example, Canadians can go to our website and get informed on the procurement and delivery of essential supplies as well as the names of the suppliers and the value of the contracts for COVID-related procurement. In addition, we regularly update Canadians on agreements the Government of Canada reaches for obtaining access to promising vaccines that are being developed around the world. We also update them on agreements that are signed to gain access to the most effective testing solutions possible, because the technology is rapidly evolving. I am proud of the efforts our government is making to keep Canadians informed about how we are acquiring these much-needed supplies.</ParaText>

I do note the auto parts manufacturers saying today that firms from across the country dropped everything to help save lives by making critical medical goods for every government in Canada, every political stripe. We did this together. That is what team Canada is.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6298320">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the motion moved by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, for whom I have great respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298321">Committee work is essential to the proper functioning of our parliamentary system and our democracy. As the last parliamentary session drew to a close, I was able to participate in the Standing Committee on Finance's examination of the last budget of the 42nd Parliament. I was also a member of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. We worked very hard to adopt a number of extremely important reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298322">I firmly believe in the role of parliamentary committees and I also believe that the motion before us deals with a subject that warrants the attention of the Standing Committee on Health. However, I must admit that I have some concerns and reservations about the details of this motion, which I could almost describe as an omnibus motion, since it contains 28 clauses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298323">As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, I make a point of looking at every proposal, every motion, including the motion that is before us today, from the perspective of our business owners, of our SMEs. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6298324">As the members here know, the motion lists 16 areas of study within 28 different clauses. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, I will focus on the areas of the motion that I believe will impact our Canadian businesses, as well as areas of international procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298325">The motion proposes to study the availability of paid sick leave to those in quarantine and voluntary isolation. I believe this is an absolutely critical aspect of our government's response to COVID-19. We all know how important it is to continue to keep our businesses open and running, while protecting the health and safety of one another. We know that the balance between the two is certainly a hard one to manage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298326">The thinking behind the government’s proposal with respect to paid sick leave is rooted in the belief that nobody should have to choose between staying home because they have symptoms of COVID-19 and being able to pay for groceries or rent. That is why we introduced Bill <Document DbId="10867435" Type="3">C-4</Document>, which included the Canada recovery sickness benefit that provides $500 per week, for up to two weeks, to Canadians who are either experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, are in self-isolation because they have COVID-19 or have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298327">As we all know, the bill received the unanimous support of the House and I believe it also passed royal assent within three days. This is an extremely good example of the speed and efficiency that is possible when we all work together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298328">The sick leave benefits that the motion proposes to study in committee fulfill the Government of Canada’s commitment under the safe restart agreement with provinces and territories. Already now, Canadians have been able to apply for the benefit since October 5, and as of this past Monday, October 12, Canadians who are not eligible for employment insurance have been able to apply for the Canada recovery benefit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298329">We know that right now our business owners cannot afford to pay for new benefits. We also know that Canadians were asking for this support. It was up to our government to respond. We will continue to respond to the needs of Canadians throughout this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6298330">I would now like to approach the motion from the perspective of employers. We know that our workers and our businesses are facing a lot of uncertainty right now. There is not as much money coming in and our business owners cannot afford to provide additional benefits even if they wanted to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298331">The Canada recovery sickness benefit is there for employed individuals who are unable to work because they are sick. The $500-a-week benefit for two weeks not only supports our workers, but it is also essential for our businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298332">We have all seen schools, offices and factories forced to close due to outbreaks of the virus. This benefit helps employers protect their teams without having to face the impossible decision of determining whether one of their employees is too sick to come to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298333">The federal government is there for them and will cover two weeks of paid leave. This is a first for Canada. The program provides a win-win solution for our SMEs and our workers while also limiting community transmission of the virus.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6298334">I have to be honest. It is not clear, on the basis of the motion before the House, what aspect of paid sick leave is being proposed for study. The motion refers to the availability of sick leave, but as the House knows, this benefit has already been available to hard-working Canadians for two weeks now. It is therefore perhaps a bit late to study whether or not this measure should go forward, and as I have explained, I believe this program to be absolutely critical. I would assume, on the basis of the fact that the bill in which this measure was included was passed unanimously by the House, that every member of the House agreed with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298335">If the motion is proposing to study how well the benefit is working, with only two weeks of usage I would suggest that it is perhaps premature to study its effect at this time. It might be more useful to study this issue independently in a stand-alone study once a longer period of usage exists and more data can be evaluated by committee members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298336">Let me now turn to another aspect of the motion that touches on international procurement, including the proposal in the motion to study the procurement of vaccines. While I understand the spirit of what is being proposed here, when I read the fine print of the motion, included therein is a requirement to disclose all documents concerning the purchase of these life-saving drugs. The motion would therefore effectively make us hand over details of our negotiating positions and considerations for deals that are not even yet complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298337">I cannot emphasize enough how this would jeopardize our ability to compete and procure what Canadians need in order to survive this pandemic. If other countries find out the good prices that Canada was successful in negotiating with suppliers, they could try to buy the order out from under us. Let me detail this a little further.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6298338">We could be forced to reveal the pricing and sales terms we obtained in our international vaccine procurement process. This would expose us to two very serious potential problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298339">If another country finds out our terms, it could decide to outbid us and hijack our order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298340">In addition, this information could undermine the Canadian government's credibility with our suppliers. The last thing we need right now is for our suppliers to decide that Canada is not a reliable partner and sign an agreement with another country that does not require them to disclose information about their terms and conditions. This is a real risk. There are quite a few other potential customers looking to procure these same vaccines.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6298341">The last thing I believe we want to do in the House is to endanger hard-fought procurement deals that will ensure that Canada has the best possible set of vaccine supply contracts. We need companies to feel confident that the Canadian government will remain a reliable partner and not look to publish reams of sensitive information regarding the company's pricing, conditions or scheduling. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298342">We know there are real risks in this ultracompetitive bidding environment. It is a global pandemic impacting countries all over the world. The competition, therefore, on the international stage is incredibly fierce. We must continue to be competitive in our bids. We must continue to be a country that vaccine suppliers wish to partner with, and our priority must continue to be to ensure that Canada has access to vaccines against COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298343">These are just a few of of the problematic issues I see in the very large motion before us. I therefore cannot support the motion as it is currently written, and Canadians cannot afford to have us jeopardize our ability to procure a vaccine to COVID-19.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298361">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise today, and I will be splitting my time with my hon. colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298362">We are here today, because we have a great motion from our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>. It is one that looks at the COVID pandemic. Yesterday, we had a motion that the government decided was a confidence motion. The government did not like what we had put forward. Nowhere and at no other time have we ever seen a group, an organization or a government work so hard at not answering a question and not providing the answers that Canadians deserve than we have seen over the last little while. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298363">A year ago yesterday, Canadians put this Liberal government on notice. From previously enjoying a majority, they were given a minority. I have to say that since the election of a minority government took place a year ago, we have seen a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who does not seem really interested in governing this country. He does not have a majority. We have not even seen a federal budget for almost two years, and what we have seen time and time again are ethical scandals and ethical blunders from this Prime Minister and his cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298364">Canadians also re-elected, a year ago yesterday, a strong Conservative opposition with a clear mandate to hold this Liberal government to account. We were elected to ask the tough questions of this government, which we do, but very seldom do we get answers. As a matter of fact, what we have seen time and again is every excuse as to why they cannot answer a question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298365">Just prior to this debate going on, we saw the parliamentary secretary stand on a point of order to say how hard it was going to be and that it would paralyze the government. It would seize-up the government to try and answer these questions. Yesterday they did not like the motion because they felt it was questioning the government and it was not COVID related. Now, we have a conscientious, measured motion that is directly related to the COVID pandemic, and they do not like it. They cannot do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298366">I have to say that the last 10 months have been among the most challenging of my elected career. I think if we surveyed the 338 members of Parliament, they would say the same thing. We are experiencing the heartbreaking stories of our constituents, Canadians who not only have health concerns, but are also facing incredible, mounting financial losses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298367">In the early days I would say that, yes, there was a team Canada approach. Opposition would challenge some of the programs that came out and offer solutions. Sometimes the information was taken and these programs were changed. However, as we sit today, there are still tens of thousands of businesses that have shuttered their doors and Canadians who are out of work. Now we are gripped with a second wave of this global pandemic, and all we are asking is what the plan is and where the money is going. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298368">In early spring, we saw almost $900 million awarded to an organization that had close ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the former finance minister. Since the opposition has been asking questions about how it happened, all we have seen is filibuster after filibuster and a refusal to answer the questions. The Liberals like to say that they released thousands of documents. Perhaps they might have released thousands of documents, but the amount of black ink that was used to scribble out the lines of information in those documents is astronomical. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6298369">Just within the last few days, we found out that early in the pandemic, a former Liberal MP was given a contract worth over $237 million, only 11 days after actually registering the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298370">Canadians have questions. The 338 members of Parliament elected to this House were elected to be the voices of Canadians. It is not a right for us to be in this House. It is a privilege. For those members who are new and who have never heard me speak, I will remind my colleagues that the House does not belong to them or me. It belongs to the electors who elected the 338 members of Parliament. They charged us to ask the hard questions of the government. They charged the opposition to hold the government's feet to the fire and to work collaboratively with the government. They also charged that minority government to work collaboratively with the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298371">I want to talk about leadership in my province of British Columbia. Throughout this pandemic, my province of British Columbia has had incredible leadership. We have been well served by Dr. Bonnie Henry. She is a former navy physician now serving as our provincial public health officer. Maybe it is because of her military background, but she had a plan and she implemented it early. She did not take risks for British Columbians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298372">On January 27, I stood in this House and mentioned to colleagues that my riding is the Asia-Pacific gateway to North America. Every day, tens of thousands of passengers enter our borders. I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> what the plans were to increase screening and to shut our borders down, as we were seeing other countries do. I was scolded. I was chastised for fearmongering and being racist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298373">Under Dr. Bonnie Henry's direction, British Columbia took swift and decisive action early and without hesitation. She communicated frequently, clearly and effectively. She implemented an early and aggressive testing and tracing strategy, and enforced social distancing regulations more rapidly than any other province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298374">Health care workers employed at multiple long-term care facilities were ordered to limit work to a single site, largely preventing the disastrous outcomes at long-term care homes seen in Ontario and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298375">Dr. Henry acted early when it mattered. Her strong and decisive leadership garnered international praise, and ultimately my province was able to flatten the infection curve ahead of other parts of Canada. Now we have seen an increase over recent months. However, she remains strong and resolute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298376">Dr. Bonnie Henry had a plan. What we are seeing with the government is that it is just now implementing pilots that other countries and other provinces have been doing for months. They did it at the start of this global pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298377">We have questions. Sadly, we have seen the government and its ministers say that committees are masters of their own destinies and that they act independently. However, all the Liberals got together and decided they were going to filibuster every committee putting forth motions challenging the government on COVID-19 spending and the WE scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298378">I am a father of four. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s actions remind me of when one of my children did not like what the other children were doing, they would complain that the others were not playing fair. They would tell us we should look at what the others were doing. They would run away, or they would just take their toys to go to another area. I think Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298379">Conservatives are here to ask the tough questions, and we will continue to do so.</ParaText>

It seems quite often that we compare our response with what I would qualify as the bottom of the barrel, which is our friends to the south, in the U.S., and how they are dealing with it. We are doing a heck of a lot better than them; however, if we compare ourselves with other countries, we are not doing as well as we have been told we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298400">The motion from my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> is fully in order and reasonable in making sure we have the documents required to make decisions on behalf of Canadians. We need to know where we have been and know what we have done in order to not make those mistakes in the future. Contrary to what the Liberals are trying to say, they are the ones who are trying to hide the gaps in their response to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298401">I have not been in Parliament for very long, and I have not been on the health committee for very long, but I always thought that when a motion was presented in a committee, members discussed it and then amended it as necessary. Members do not stand there and filibuster for two full meetings, which is basically what has happened for both meetings of the health committee to date. As a matter of fact, I do not think I have had an opportunity to say more than three words in that committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298402">I know, beyond this motion, there are a number of other motions that are great pieces of study as well. One that will be coming from our friends in the Bloc is a study of the PMPRB. Let us get moving on this first motion to provide information to the members of that committee and to the people in the House of Commons, so that we know where we have been to help us go where we want to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298403">I was not going to talk about the team Canada approach until later on in my speech, but I want to underline that everybody has been raising the team Canada flag and saying that we all need to be working together. Most times, the team Canada approach is only for Liberal members. We, in the opposition, are not provided with the information we require to make decisions or to know whether something is being done correctly or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298404">I want to thank all of our health care workers. I know and understand they are very busy, especially those who are working with patients who have COVID-19, or those who are working at many of our testing sites and labs. They are working to plan, especially the chief medical officers of health and the premiers who are making decisions on behalf of the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298405">I will even thank the public servants in the<Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s department, but I am sure within a few weeks they would like to prove us wrong. Why not prove the opposition wrong on some of the allegations they have been bringing forward? Would it not be better to provide the information of this motion so that they can prove us wrong once and for all, or so we can find the gaps and close them up?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298406">Let us look at some real examples of gaps in our response to COVID-19. I will use the example of Nova Scotia. We do not necessarily have much COVID-19. I forget what the number is today, but even in the Atlantic bubble, we have fewer than 100 or so cases of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298407">That is because the medical officers of health decided a long time ago that they would close our borders to visitors, and make sure that people coming in isolated for 14 days. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298408">Even within the bubble, we have had challenges on testing, especially when students went back to school. A few weeks ago, my niece was exhibiting symptoms and my sister-in-law and brother had to call the 811 number to try to book a test. It took eight days to get the test and a response so that my niece could go back to school. Quite honestly, she was more worried about transmitting the disease than she was about getting it herself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298409">Luckily, in Nova Scotia there is a semi-rapid test. It is a gargle test. If COVID shows up, people can have the other test. There were eight days of lockdown, eight days of no school and eight days of no work for that family. This is the kind of thing that has been going on and that is why we need rapid tests, even in Atlantic Canada, which has the lowest numbers of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298410">I am glad the folks in Atlantic Canada have made their own decisions as to how to go forward, contrary, in a lot of cases, to what the Government of Canada has been saying. I know they all sit at a table and work on things, but I am glad there is this independence of the different provinces making their own decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298411">The other thing I want to ask, in order to understand what the government has done, is why companies that we know can provide rapid testing have not been accepted at this point. In Nova Scotia, Sona Nanotech has a gold standard when it comes to rapid testing and it has not been approved yet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298412">Why has it not been approved? I am sure we will find that out with the information provided to us by the government through this motion.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6298413">Canadians need to know why the Liberals failed so miserably at preparing us for the second wave of COVID-19. We need those answers so we can develop a better plan for moving forward. The Liberals have plenty of public servants who are paid to do this work. There is no reason they cannot do it. That is why we at the Standing Committee on Health need to get back to work. The physical and mental health of Canadians depends on it, our economic health depends on it, and our future as a prosperous G7 country depends on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298414">I invite my parliamentary colleagues of all political stripes to support this motion to finally give meaning to the term “team Canada” and restore Canadians' confidence in the independence of committees and the importance of their work. The health of Canadians is not a bargaining chip, and it does not belong to any political party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298422">We can agree on the fact that we are going through a public health crisis that requires heavy investment in health care. As the critic for status of women and seniors, I have been hearing a lot about that. People tell me that, in order to provide care to everyone, we need more PPE and support workers, and we need to pay support workers better. Nobody I talk to says we need national standards. In fact, my colleague talked about the importance of respecting each region's unique needs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298428">Madam Speaker, this is kind of what this is all about. It is about the transparency of decision-making. The Government of Canada spends billions of dollars. We need to know, especially within this response to COVID-19, exactly where those dollars have gone, how they were invested, who they actually helped and who they are going to be helping, so that we can see where those gaps are and we can make a decision on whether we are going to continue to support one program or another. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298430">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="253142" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298431">This motion from the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> includes six exhaustive orders for the production of an extraordinary number of documents. I am not going to go through each of these requests one by one, but I will make some observations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298432">First, it is premature to request documents in the manner set out in this motion. Receiving a massive package of documents that we will all need to sort through is unproductive. I suggest that instead, as each topic is studied, documents can be requested from the witnesses who appear before the committee, as they often are. This suggestion would ensure that the committee receives the relevant documents when they are studying each issue. It would also help the members of the committee to know what documents are pertinent to their study, as witnesses can point them in the right direction through their expertise. Indeed, that would be a far more efficient and helpful way to request documents. The way the Conservatives are requesting to proceed in this motion is problematic in part because of the challenges it will present for committee members. It will not enable them to do their jobs effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298433">There are also human and financial costs. I remind all members that the public service continues to work around the clock with real objectives to help all Canadians. Every time documents are requested, whether the request is large or small, our hard-working public servants have to look for the documents, compile them and translate them. This country's bilingualism is one of its greatest strengths, but it also requires that time and money are spent on translation. It means that documents cannot be produced as quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298434">It is also essential to consider the amount of time these document searches take. Every person involved does their utmost to ensure their examination is thorough. A search can take days, weeks and even months, and each person involved in it is taken away from doing other work, which means that fewer people are working on the issues that matter most to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298435">This production of documents request does not only apply to our hard-working public servants who work in government departments. When document requests relate to ministers and their offices, the same logic applies to all these same people. Ministers' offices must stop doing their work, stop preparing important legislation, stop critical engagement with stakeholders and go through every email, every memo and every note to ensure that these requests are satisfied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298436">Please do not misunderstand me. I am not suggesting in any way that transparency is not essential. I know that my Conservative colleagues will try to paint this as the government trying to avoid being open and transparent with Canadians, but that could not be further from the truth. The truth is that there is a balance between transparency and efficiency. All I am suggesting is that the right balance needs happen to not unduly delay or restrict the government's capacity to do the work that Canadians want and need us to do. Canadians are counting on us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298437">Hard-working public servants are doing the critical work of helping Canadians. Instead of keeping Canadians safe, they would be forced to redirect their efforts to filling these orders. It is worth noting that most, if not all, people are working from home, and locating these documents therefore poses more of a challenge. Most people are not in their offices right now, because they cannot be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298438">Just yesterday, Ontario reported 790 new cases of COVID-19 and nine new deaths from the virus. Of these, 57 were in Ottawa. In total, 260 people are hospitalized in Ontario because of COVID-19, including 71 in intensive care, and there are 144 new COVID-19 cases related to schools, including at least 66 among students. People need to be able to work from home. This reality makes locating documents even more time-consuming and challenging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298439">The Conservatives do not seem concerned about helping the many Canadians who find themselves in dire straits because of the pandemic. They do not seem to care about helping millions of Canadians suffering from mental health issues. However, Canadians care about these things, and we are here because Canadians elected us. I would like to do the work that Canadians need us to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298440">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> has stated, “the committee is the master of its own business” and “I think it behooves all committee members to remember that the committee is the master of its own destiny”. Why does she refuse to work with the other parties at the health committee to find a constructive way forward? She could easily have withdrawn her initial omnibus motion and reworked it in collaboration with her colleagues on the committee. I would argue that if she wanted to get work done on these issues, as she so often says she does, that would have been a more logical approach. Instead, she has chosen to ask the House to dictate to the committee what work it should undertake. She could easily present a motion at committee requesting a briefing from officials on specific topics. She could submit individual motions on each unique and vital area that she would like the committee to study so it can prioritize the issues that are most pressing and begin the important work that all members are here to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298441">I obviously cannot support this motion as it is presently drafted and, frankly, I am not sure how anyone can. However, I am hopeful that colleagues across the way will do the right thing and support us in voting down this motion, allowing the committee members together to decide what work they should undertake.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298458">As Canadians are experiencing a devastating second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, it is our duty as a government to ensure that the focus remains on the health and well-being of Canadians and that we continue to do everything to support them. Yesterday, there were over 2,600 new cases of COVID-19 and over 22,000 active cases. I suggest we need to focus on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298459">My intervention will focus on four key sections of the motion as it relates to COVID-19, specifically the motion to study the adequacy of health transfers, the adoption of the World Health Organization advice, matters related to the COVID-19 Alert application and the impact of COVID-19 on mental health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298460">As the co-chair of the Parliamentary Mental Health Caucus, I was delighted to hear that the member for <Affiliation DbId="253010" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation> had tabled a motion to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Canadians, including indigenous and racialized Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298461">The speaker before me, the <Affiliation DbId="253134" Type="2">chair of the health committee</Affiliation>, indicated that this motion was shut down without debate. The result of the study would have identified that many socio-economic gaps that exist within our society have been further exasperated by the COVID-19 pandemic. By addressing these gaps in our society, we as a government could address the increasing demand on our health care systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298462">However, as I said, the motion introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253010" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation> was rejected by the health committee. I would like to note that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> voted against it as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298463">Therefore, I was a little surprised to see that the motion on mental health, which was rejected, is now included as a line item in this omnibus motion, with its intention to paralyze the work of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298464">As I mentioned previously, I will limit my intervention to specific sections of the motion today, mainly sections (i), (j), (l) and section (n) from another motion that was put forward at the health committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298465">In section (i), states, “the adequacy of health transfer payments to the provinces, in light of the COVID-19 crisis.” I find it interesting that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> wants to study the adequacy of health transfer payments as it relates to COVID-19. As we all know, the current formula was adopted back in 2014 by former Prime Minister Harper's cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298466">Our government has invested more in health care transfer payments since coming to power and will continue to do so. We know that governments at all levels are working together to keep Canadians safe from COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298467">Each year provinces and territories receive $40 billion through the Canada health transfer. In March 2020, we committed $500 million to provinces and territories to support their health care systems and their mitigation efforts in light of the crisis. Since then, our government has announced over $19 billion for the safe restart agreement to help provinces and territories restart their economy safely while we continue to respond to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298468">The health and well-being of Canadians remains our top priority and the government realizes that engaging with provinces and territories to address key health priorities is important, now more than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298469">In 2017, we committed $11 billion in health care investments over 10 years to the provinces and territories, with targeted funding of $5 billion to improve access to mental health services. The study of the adequacy of transfer payments also needs to address the need for an appropriate evaluation method and issues related to the oversight of the management of the fund. This cannot be addressed until we clearly identify the existing gaps in the delivery of the program and services, especially those that may disproportionately affect the most vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298470">However, this topic cannot be studied as part of an omnibus motion in the committee. It needs to have its own separate study. We will keep working with the provinces and territories to fight COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298471">Section (j) states, “the impact of the government’s use of World Heath Organization (WHO) advice in early 2020 to delay the closure of borders and delay in the recommendation of wearing of masks on the spread of COVID-19 in Canada.” While I am not a member of the Standing Committee on Health, I do follow the study of motions in this committee because of my keen interest in mental health. As such, I am aware that the health committee has already studied these exact provisions over the summer and has already received a great deal of evidence as was highlighted by the previous speaker.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298472">As I was reviewing this section, I was wondering what the scope of this section should actually be to further augment or build on the study that was already conducted rather than opening up the whole box again. Our government has been following the advice of public health officials since the beginning. In January, we took multiple measures at our border. At first, we took enhanced measures for travellers from hot-spot countries and as soon as it became evident that COVID-19 could no longer be traced to a handful of countries, we restricted non-essential travel for travellers from all countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298473">We also know that masks have been recommended for symptomatic people suspected of or confirmed to have the virus. In most cities and towns, masks are mandatorily worn to protect against exposure. The policies and practices around masks have changed as medical professionals have learned more about the virus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298474">Section (l) states, “the development, efficacy and use of data related to the government’s COVID Alert application.” Our government, in collaboration with other sectors, has developed the COVID-19 Alert app to let users know if they have been exposed to COVID-19. With most illnesses, early detection plays a key role in improving health outcomes for those who may be infected, but also protecting our loved ones and limiting further infections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298475">The COVID Alert app is an important public health tool that will help Canadians identify if they may have been exposed to COVID-19. While downloading the app is voluntary, we are encouraging Canadians to download it. So far over four million Canadians are using it.

              <ParaText id="6298480">Then there is section (n), the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, from another motion. As mentioned at the outset of my intervention, Canadians have been worried about the second wave and what it means for their jobs and livelihoods. It has increased the prevalence of depression, psychological distress, substance use, PTSD and domestic violence. The all-party Parliamentary Mental Health Caucus in the 43rd parliament, which includes members from both Houses and all parties, is actively investigating all of these. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298481">In light of the pandemic, our government has invested $11.5 million, distributed through the Public Health Agency, to promote mental health and well-being in our communities. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research has invested more than $10 million in 55 research projects during the COVID-19 pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298482">By introducing an omnibus motion that sets out 17 different areas of study and six requests for production of papers that have already been studied in committee is tying up our administrative capacities, and that cannot be allowed. Our committees are tools that allow us as parliamentarians to better serve Canadians by delving further into the issues mentioned earlier in my speech. This motion minimizes the importance of issues that are currently affecting Canadians. As such, I am not supporting the motion. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298483">Madam Speaker, the reason the opposition has put this motion forward today in Parliament is because we have been unable to study COVID at the health committee. Therefore, the purpose of this motion is to get the information required and make the health committee do the study. The opposition is united and Canadians want this information, but they have been unable to do it at committee. We have had to bring it to the House of Commons in order to direct the committee to do that work and get those documents so it can do it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298496">Today I rise in this place to speak on a topic of great importance, not only to my constituents but in fact to all Canadians, as we seek to navigate a way forward as we combat and eventually tackle COVID-19 and its impacts in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298497">We are nearing eight months now of this enduring pandemic, with no immediate end in sight. As we enter what some are calling a second wave, Canadians should be rightfully expecting the Liberal government to have been better prepared this time around. Sadly, if the Liberals' actions at the Standing Committee on Health are any indication, the government is simply not prepared to present and defend a plan that will give Canadians the tools to quickly detect and prevent the spread of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298498">Canadians need these tools now to ensure a second full-scale shutdown of our economy does not occur. Too many have made great personal sacrifices to get to where we are today, yet still thousands of lives have been lost, thousands more fall ill by the day and millions find themselves out of work and are losing hope the jobs they once had will still be there whenever this pandemic is finally conquered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298499">I come from a tourism community, where 40,000 people work in the sector. There are over 16,000 hotel rooms in my riding alone that traditionally accommodate 14 million visitors to our community. Prior to this pandemic, these visitors would generate $2.4 billion in receipts per year. That is quite a significant economic impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298500">COVID-19 hit the travel and tourism sector hard. It hit us first, it hit us hardest and we will take the longest to recover. Niagara is a microcosm of the Canadian travel and tourism sector. Overall, this segment of our national economy employs almost one in 10 Canadians, generating over $102 billion. Sadly, we still wait not only for an economic plan but a proper response in terms of our health planning so we can begin to move forward to help achieve the economic recovery that is badly needed in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298501">When dealing with this pandemic, vigilance in providing for the health and safety of Canadians must always be our top priority. However, where is the vision and way forward to lead us out of this pandemic and back to a somewhat normal lifestyle? Where is that vision? Where is that plan?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298502">The recent Speech from the Throne was 32 pages in length, contained almost 7,000 words and yet only mentioned the word “tourism” once. How many more sacrifices can Canadians be told to make by the Liberal government as it continues forward without any plans for a recovery? Canadians are suffering and the government needs to do more. Doing more does not always mean giving out more money or adding more blanket restrictions or limiting more freedoms and civil liberties of Canadians. Sometimes doing more means finding the best innovative solutions quickly to fix some of the root causes of the issue. That issue is COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298503">Again, the health and safety of Canadians will always be paramount, but moving forward to address the economic pain brought about by this pandemic need not be mutually exclusively concepts. As we moved to immediately address COVID-19, the Liberal government implemented policies that, while needed at the time, brought about tremendous pain to the Canadian economy and the millions of Canadians it employs. These were measures such as the Canada-U.S. border closure, travel bans prohibiting foreign nationals from entering Canada, 14-day mandatory quarantine restrictions and federal government advisories warning Canadians to avoid all air travel, even within Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298504">Under these restrictions, our travel and tourism industry has been devastated. Nearly eight months into this pandemic, the consequences of these restrictions are starting to be exposed. Last week's announcement from WestJet to cancel many key routes to eastern Canada may just be the beginning of more painful changes coming to the travel and tourism industry in our country, but it does not have to be this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298505">Other advanced countries like the United Kingdom and those of the European Union are moving forward using science-based approaches and implementing viable alternatives to blanket prohibitions and quarantines without compromising safety. We are not seeing this here in Canada from our federal government. We have not seen a sector-specific tourism recovery plan from the Liberal government, something our Conservation opposition has been asking for from the start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298506">There is no reason Canada cannot be a leader in the COVID-19 response and recovery, just as these countries have. The longer this pandemic drags on, the more we are seeing the Liberal government in policy paralysis.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6298507">Although the policy environment is quickly changing and extremely dynamic, the Trudeau Liberals fail to keep up, consult, adapt and change, and only do so when pressed by the opposition. This is even more frustrating to see when we know businesses and industries are desperately trying to forge ahead with their own solutions in the interests of their own survival.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298508">For example, a number of aviation and academic stakeholders have been spearheading a rapid-testing pilot project at Pearson International Airport in Toronto since early September. After about 23,000 COVID-19 test samples from incoming travellers, 99% returned negative. Their success rate is truly encouraging and an initiative like this offers a beacon of hope for the survival and future return of travel and tourism in a dark time. Unfortunately, Health Canada and the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> had to be brought into that process begrudgingly to learn more about the encouraging results coming from industry-led research on rapid testing. We absolutely need to know why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298509">As the member of Parliament for Niagara Falls and as a special adviser to the leader on tourism recovery, I hear many stakeholders in the travel and tourism industries pushing for more support from the federal government in the areas of advancing vaccine development and rapid testing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298510">Earlier today, news broke that the federal government is going to allow a rapid-testing pilot project in Alberta as a means to replace the mandatory 14-day quarantine measures currently in place. Despite this encouraging lead, no timelines have been announced yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298511">Travel and tourism stakeholders have been pushing for rapid testing advancement for months with a strong sense of urgency, a sense that is reflective of the opportunity costs and the real cost being incurred every day by businesses both large and small. Many small business owners have been forced to close, either temporarily or permanently. Larger businesses are inching toward being forced to make difficult decisions, such as restructuring, taking on more debt, slashing services or deferring capital improvements. The speed at which government acts on these files can literally determine whether a business keeps its doors open or closes them forever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298512">Considering all this, it is only appropriate that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, who serves as our Conservative shadow minister for health, has introduced this comprehensive opposition day motion. Her motion will compel the Standing Committee on Health to undertake a study on the emergency situation facing Canadians in light of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is needed and her motion has my full support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298513">I find it astonishing that it takes the official opposition to propose such an obvious study. One would think the government would have been eager to launch such a study itself far earlier in the pandemic, unless, of course, they are concerned such a study could expose and highlight their abject failures of mismanaging Canada's pandemic response. The longer we are in an emergency crisis, the more urgent and important it is to undertake this study so we can ensure the federal government is developing science-based policies that are helpful and adaptive to our ever-changing circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298514">Speaking of which, many stakeholders from the travel and tourism industry are extremely supportive of rapid testing. They hold high hopes that a proven method will soon reduce the days needed to quarantine or possibly eliminate quarantine all together some day in the future. Would it not be nice if our federal government could demonstrate confidence in a science-based approach for implementing viable alternatives to blanket prohibitions and quarantines without compromising safety?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298515">Throughout this pandemic, the Liberal government has advocated for a science-based approach to tackling the health issues brought about by COVID-19. Then when industry takes leadership to launch its own initiative, the federal government has to be brought along all while maintaining restrictions that are devastating to travel and tourism. When science can benefit industry and support the health and safety of Canadians, the Trudeau Liberals choose to ignore it. We need to know why and this study will help us understand.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298537">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298538">At a time when Canadians of all stripes should be joining together to fight COVID-19 in any way we can, I am endlessly frustrated to see the Liberals attempting to withhold and hide information on this. There is a pattern when it comes to the current government hiding information, whether it is to do with the documents related to COVID-19 or the WE Charity scandal, and that needs to end immediately. Canadians have a right to know what their government has done and is continuing to do to protect them through the pandemic, yet the Liberals refuse to be transparent with information to the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298539">In the previous session of Parliament, which ended abruptly because of prorogation, I sat on the Standing Committee on Health. As a health care professional by trade, it was important to me that this committee received all possible evidence to ensure that the Government of Canada was doing exactly what it should be with respect to managing a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298540">On January 28, I had a sit-down meeting in Ottawa with the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to discuss the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in China and the potential spread to Canada. In that meeting, the minister repeatedly assured me that everything was being handled, that she was working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada, that she was in close contact with her international counterparts and that she would keep parliamentarians and the public informed with respect to any developments. We now know that this was little more than the usual placations doled out by the Liberals whenever their feet are being held to the fire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298541">While I appreciate the minister speaking with me, nothing of value came from that meeting aside from empty reassurances. We now know that mismanagement occurred in a number of government departments, hence why we have had to present today's opposition day motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298542">In the last session, the Standing Committee on Health held its first meeting discussing the COVID-19 pandemic on January 29, 2020, well before other committees. We heard from the then president of the Public Health Agency of Canada as well as Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam. At the onset, when asked how many tests we had available, and after much pressure, we were finally told only 6,000 per day for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298543">Right from the get-go, we were told that there were some complications when it came to data sharing among the federal and provincial levels of government and issues surrounding jurisdictional authority on data collection and management. This immediately raised a red flag for me. I know how essential it is to have as much detailed information as one can possibly get, especially as it relates to a potential epidemiological scenario. From my point of view as a health care practitioner, one does not make a diagnosis until one has completed a history, all the signs and symptoms, all the appropriate diagnostic lab and radiological tests, determined the differential diagnosis and then the diagnosis. This enables one to provide the appropriate treatment based upon the data and facts. However, in this situation, the data was not complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298544">The lack of clarity with respect to data sharing eventually trickled down to affect the messaging by the Public Health Agency, PHAC. Senior government officials and public health spokespersons regularly flip-flopped on a number of key issues for months, such as the wearing of masks. One day we were told to wear a mask by the minister and the next we were told that they were almost ineffective by the chief public health officer. When asked for the new research on masks they were using to make these decisions, we were provided with an abstract review of the old research and not any new research. This went on far too long, and I feel that it contributed to the spread of COVID-19 among Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298545">I must say that, by and large, Canadians are the kind of people who will try to do the right thing. They do, however, need clear guidance from the experts on what that is, and that is where this government failed miserably.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298546">With respect to my time on the health committee, in the first month we learned about COVID-19 and how it was impacting Canada. We heard from a many great witnesses throughout the six months, and this collection of knowledge and testimony from these witnesses should be included as indicated in today's motion. The spirit of co-operation changed, however, when my Conservative colleague tabled a motion calling for the production of government documents related to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Does that sound familiar? We are fighting that exact same thing yet again today. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6298547">Immediately the Liberal members of the committee went into protection mode with unreasonable and unnecessary attempts time and again to change the scope of the documents requested and the length of timelines for production, and were cagey about letting documents get into the hands of the opposition. When the documents were finally provided, they were so heavily redacted by department officials that they were all but useless. On that issue, a letter was sent by the parliamentary law clerk to the clerk of the committee stating, “As my Office has not been given the opportunity to see the unredacted information, we are not able to confirm or adopt those redactions.” Where have we heard that before?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298548">This was another huge red flag and it is only growing. The fact that we on this side of the House still need to fight tooth and nail just to review how the government has responded to the pandemic raises a greater issue with respect to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s utter lack of transparency to Canadians. For months on end he spouted lots of warm, fluffy words, yet through his MPs on the health committee, he refused to disclose the information that would actually help Canada get through this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298549">There are so many questions that have been left unanswered by the government, and today's motion looks at getting some answers through the health committee. One of the major questions I still have, despite having asked it a number of times in a variety of ways, is about the mismanagement of the national emergency strategic stockpile. While this stockpile is meant to be readily available in the event of a national emergency, the Liberals allowed the supplies in this stockpile to expire. Instead of replenishing them immediately, they simply sent them to a landfill and left the shelves bare, closed down warehouses and sent supplies to China. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298550">These shortages had serious negative impacts on front-line workers during the first wave of COVID-19. I have asked the minister multiple times if she can tell me when the NESS will be fully restocked, yet six months after the fact, she still did not have an answer and was clearly unwilling to share what she knew. One can assume that even as of today it is still not restocked. This is exactly why we have had to pursue motions like this one. Getting information from the government is like pulling teeth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298551"> Another question I have has to do with the shuttering of the global public health intelligence network. This system was meant to warn Canadians of any potential epidemiological scenario occurring around the world so that our Public Health Agency would have adequate time to prepare and respond. For some unknown reason, GPHIN was shut down just months before COVID-19, slowing the response of Canadian agencies to the pandemic. This early warning system would have identified human-to-human transmission earlier, as Taiwan's system did in December. This cost some Canadians their lives and has cost hundreds of thousands their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298552">I would like to point out that there are countries that have had great success in their response to COVID-19. Speaking of Taiwan, it took immediate action to protect its citizens by enforcing the use of PPE and being very strict about its borders. It immediately recognized the importance of data and incorporated it into its decision-making, and the statistics clearly show that it worked, with 544 total cases and seven deaths overall. I can only wonder how the statistics for Canada might look if the Liberals had taken swift, aggressive action on measures to stop the spreading of the virus rather than flip-flopping daily on the advice they gave to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298553">I truly and sincerely hope that Canadians can see through the facade that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298554">We are now in the second wave of COVID-19. We need solutions to keep Canadians safe while also keeping our economy open. The shuttering of Parliament through prorogation purely to hide from the WE scandal resulted in lost time that could have been used to develop plans for accessing critical tools and supplies like rapid testing. Conservatives are committed to taking the time and doing whatever it takes to improve Canada's response, but we cannot do that when the Liberals constantly shut down every attempt to get the data needed.</ParaText>

I must say that the motion did not come completely out of the blue. Ever since it was first moved, the Liberals have been filibustering. For those watching at home, filibustering means that they were preventing debate and discussion by burning up time. Some call it filibustering while others call it stubbornness and a waste of time. It is a major waste of time in the exercise of democracy.</ParaText>

The Standing Committee on Health needs to debate other issues as well. One example is a study on drug costs, which was proposed by the Bloc Québécois. Obviously, the time wasted on filibustering is time we no longer have to debate the motion, to get to the bottom of things and to study other important aspects of this pandemic.</ParaText>

We have been somewhat overwhelmed by the situation and that is why we want to further study how the government managed the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298583">The motion contains several elements. It proposes to study access to rapid testing. It is up to Health Canada to study the tests and decide if they meet Canadian standards and it is up to the federal government to approve them. What we have come to realize and know is that it took the government a long time to receive and accept the rapid tests proposed by Health Canada. The second wave arrived, but the rapid tests were not ready. These tests quickly provide results to people who believe they have COVID-19 symptoms. Not only does this prevent them from spreading the virus to others, but they also do not lose out on hours of work, especially in the case of PSWs working in hospitals. It is very important that we obtain these rapid tests. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298584">The government has been very critical of the provinces and their management of the pandemic. It has had many criticisms, especially about how Quebec managed the pandemic. Unfortunately, there have been many deaths in our long term care facilities. Seniors were hit hard and directly affected by the virus. It is up to the government to quickly provide the provinces and Quebec with these rapid tests. It is dragging its feet a bit. If we had the tests at the start of the second wave, management of the pandemic would have been completely different.</ParaText>

These community organizations offer essential support to these women, and if we had rapid testing, that would certainly help them provide faster, more responsive service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298586">I have another example. In Quebec, the government decided to leave schools open and created bubble classes. If a teacher is infected, the entire bubble ends up in isolation. Access to rapid testing would help determine within hours of the onset of symptoms whether it is necessary to have the teachers and students isolate at home. Access to these tests is very important and it is the federal government's responsibility to procure them for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298587">The government is quick to tell us that we are not doing our job properly and goes so far as to come tell us how to run our long-term care facilities. However, testing is the government's responsibility and it has not been up to the task. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298588"> Let's not forget that 20% of our caregivers who contracted COVID-19 were guardian angels. If a rapid test had been available, personal support workers caring for seniors and social workers working with seniors could likely have taken the test the moment symptoms appeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298589">It is already October 22, and it is very important for the government to explain to us why the provinces still do not have access to rapid tests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298590">We have been talking about seniors a lot, and with reason, but we need to remember that, before the pandemic, many people were already suffering because of a lack of health care services. That includes people with mental health and addiction issues, people experiencing homelessness and children on the autism spectrum. All of those people were suffering before COVID-19, but the pandemic made it clear that Quebec's health care system is stretched thin. It has not been easy: Managers and workers are doing a lot with less, they are optimizing resources, they are coming up with quality indicators and abiding by the strictest possible standards so they can provide quality service to the majority of those who need it. The fact remains that the health care system does not have the means and resources it needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298591">The motion therefore proposes to examine the need to transfer money that belongs to Quebeckers to Quebec so that it can invest in its health care system. The provinces and Quebec have asked the federal government several times to give them the funding they need to do what they are in the best position to do, which is to help and care for people. However, it is obvious that Ottawa does not want to do that. The federal government wants to maintain control. It is resisting and opposing that request, and it is even being arrogant toward Quebec and the provinces in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298592">Can the government and the Liberal Party do something constructive and quickly propose clear amendments that will enable us to move forward with this study and prevent the Standing Committee on Health, which is so important, particularly during a pandemic, from being paralyzed? It is up to the federal government to make the next move. We are appealing to its good faith and, as they say, the ball is now in their court.</ParaText>

Throughout the whole COVID pandemic, we have had only about 150 cases. I want to congratulate the folks back home who follow the public health guidelines and encourage them to not give up. Just because we have no cases does not mean we can let our guard down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298614">I also want to thank all the health care workers. Although we have had few cases in my region, they are always on duty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298615">I also want to thank everyone who has come up with smart, innovative and creative solutions. That is exactly what we need during a crisis like this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298616">I have to say, tody's topic is of particular interest to me. We are talking about health and the crisis. I am a person with my own story. I come from a family of individuals who have worked in health care. There are a lot of nurses in my circles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298617">My mother is a nurse. All my life, I have heard people talk about the health care system and its pressing needs. I am now in my forties, and I was hearing about that when I was five, seven or eight years old. I am still hearing about it now, and I think the needs are becoming increasingly desperate. If I might pay tribute to my mother, at one point, the needs were so dire that she was thinking of quitting her job for her own health. The health care system is clearly in a terrible state. These people are committed. As I have said before, it is a calling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298618">I support the motion before us today. I would like to see a comprehensive study of the government's actions during the crisis. That is the opposition's role. As I was thinking about what I would say today, I decided to reiterate some of my remarks. On too many occasions in this Parliament, I have risen because attempts were being made to silence the opposition. The Liberals did not want to talk about WE Charity, so they prorogued the House. Now they do not want us to adopt a motion to examine the government's actions because they do not want to talk about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298619">The government is always trying to avoid dialogue, which is the cornerstone of democracy. This is where one side has one way of thinking, and the other side has another way of thinking. There needs to be a discussion. As my colleague from Salaberry—Suroît pointed out, we need to be able to ask the tough questions and dig deeper. We always need to push further, but the Liberals will not let us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298621">This is the biggest crisis, a time when we should be assessing how we can improve and how we can save lives, but the government refuses to talk about what it did. We are not trying to make improvements just for the sake of it. People are depending on us. We must be responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298622">I have spoken about my past, my own personal story. I want to point out that members in the House come from different backgrounds. I have a teaching background, having taught at the CEGEP level. I cannot help but draw a parallel to my own experience and what I do as a teacher. My colleague drew the same parallel to her experience as a manager.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298623">One of my roles as a teacher is to correct students. It is not always fun, because I have to focus and ask myself what the person might have been thinking, what they had access to, and what they were able to do in order to objectively and thoroughly assess the assignment. The purpose of all that is for the student to achieve certain objectives. I do that with students aged 17 to 21 who are heading to university. I prepare them for starting university. I ensure that they acquire the necessary knowledge.</ParaText>

It says we cannot do anything because we are in the middle of the second wave. There are people who may die of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298625">Exams are not fatal, fortunately, but if I had a second exam next week, I would certainly want to know what I did right in the first exam and what I can do to improve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298626">As elected members, we have a responsibility, but we must also be humble. Humility enables us to learn and grow in order to do better moving forward. That is truly the role of the opposition, which I will talk about more later, but the analogy is appropriate. I believe that the government should learn its lesson, because no one is above learning from the past. That is what it should do, and fast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298627">I will say this again, because as a teacher, I believe that repetition can make the message stick. The Bloc Québécois decided to vote against the throne speech because of the health transfer issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298628">Premier Legault asked for a significant increase in the health transfer, because year after year, the federal government has been shirking its responsibilities to a significant degree. The concept of responsibility will come up many times, I believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298629">The federal government's share of health care used to be 50% and used to cover 50% of Quebec's health expenditures, but its share has been shrinking steadily and is now just 21%. Health care is not a federal responsibility, it is the jurisdiction of the provinces and Quebec. Despite what the premiers are asking for, and regardless of what previous governments did, the current federal government is shirking its responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298630">Then it stands up and lectures us. I find that arrogant, insulting and disrespectful towards our constituents, and I will explain why. It lectures us and tells us that it saved us. It is playing the saviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298631">Let me suggest an analogy, a dramatic one. Imagine if I were to starve a child, give them nothing to eat, even though I am responsible for feeding them, and then accuse them of being hungry. That is what the feds were doing with other governments. The federal government told Quebec that it sent in the army to help because Quebec was utterly incapable of taking care of its own people. Outwardly, this was a show of kindness and generosity on the part of the federal government, but there was really nothing generous about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298632">They cause the problem, and then they decide to be the solution. Maybe their goal is just to interfere where they do not belong or, as the <Affiliation DbId="252623" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> adroitly pointed out, maybe they just want to be able to put a little Canadian flag on a cheque and send it off to reinforce the impression that Canada is the one in charge of people's health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298633">The thing is, that is Quebec's responsibility. The nurses and all the other health care workers work for Quebec. Quebec pays, but Ottawa is withholding Quebec's money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298634">Eventually, the system will break down, because we have an aging population. Not only has there been a shortfall for many years now, but the aging population will create additional needs, so the transfers will need to be increased even more. Add the COVID-19 crisis on top of that, and it is easy to imagine how far off the mark we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298635">I have not said half of what I wanted to say. I could go on and on, but I will wrap up now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298636">In the House today, in response to questions about what is going on at the University of Ottawa, the Prime Minister once again pretended that the problem does not exist. If nobody mentions it, there is no problem. It was the same with the WE Charity scandal and with the Aga Khan. These problems simply do not exist, because the Prime Minister says so. I do not know what happens in committee, but when it comes to health care, just because we are not talking about a problem does not mean it does not exist.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298657">Today, as Canada and the world continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, Conservative opposition members find ourselves once again fighting to do our jobs as parliamentarians. We are fighting for an accountable and ethical government. We are fighting for Canadians to get the answers that they deserve. Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal government yet again continue to fight us every step of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298658">The motion we are considering today would allow the health committee to thoroughly study and evaluate the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and present its findings to the House. This is at a time when Canadians need answers and confidence in their government. The necessity of the motion should be indisputable. It is a motion that could and should have been settled at the health committee, but the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Liberal members of Parliament have been hard at work preventing the adoption of this motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298659">They have wasted time filibustering and coming up with any excuse to shut down the health committee meetings. This is the same behaviour that we have also seen at the ethics and finance committees ironically, and it is disrespectful to all Canadians who are facing so much uncertainty. It is disrespectful to all Canadians who have been asked to and have sacrificed so much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298660">There is a troubling pattern with the Liberal government that started well before this pandemic. The Liberals have repeatedly shown disdain for Parliament and the duties of parliamentarians. This is a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has so much to hide that he threatened an election just this week to avoid the formation of a special committee to review the WE Charity scandal. In what seems to be an effort to avoid accountability at all costs, we have had a prorogation, a resignation, hours of filibustering and threats of sending Canadians to the polls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298661"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claims that he wants to focus on the pandemic. If that is sincere, then there should be no reason to obstruct the motion. We are already seeing rising numbers of COVID cases in Canada this fall, and Canadians need confidence that there is a plan to navigate us through this pandemic and beyond. However, this government has failed to demonstrate that it has any kind of plan. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298662">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claimed to have prorogued Parliament so that he could deliver a throne speech with a detailed path forward. As we know, that proved not to be true. There is no detailed plan to keep Canadians safe and healthy, and there is no real plan to keep our economy going. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has now broken a record for the longest stretch in Canadian history without the federal government presenting a budget. Canadians deserve to know exactly what decisions have been made by this government and based on what evidence. They need to know that the Liberals are learning from their failures in this pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298663">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would prefer to compare Canada to countries that are faring the worst so that he can pat himself on the back. That low bar fails Canadians, and none more so than Canada's seniors who have been the hardest hit in this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298664"> Long-term care homes have been at the epicentre of this health crisis in Canada. The Canadian Institute for Health Information released an analysis in the spring that painted a clear picture of the devastation in long-term care. Long-term care residents accounted for 81% of COVID deaths in Canada. Compare that with the average of 38% in other OECD countries, and it is more than double our international counterparts. That is the standard we need to measure ourselves against, not those who are doing worse. We need to understand how other countries manage better in long-term care homes and work in collaboration with provinces to quickly adopt better measures. We owe that to Canada's seniors living in long-term care, their families and those working in these facilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298665">That same Canadian Institute for Health Information analysis identified prevention measures taken in countries with fewer infections and deaths in long-term care, which included infection control measures, broad testing, increased training, isolation wards to manage clusters, increased staffing and access to personal protective equipment. When we consider those prevention measures, we already know that Canada is not up to par.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298666">Well before the pandemic, long-term care voices were asking for infrastructure investment and raising the alarm on staffing shortages. We have seen these issues exacerbated during this pandemic, and we have all read the heartbreaking reports on the conditions in some of these care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298667"> However, what actions have really been taken in the immediate term to protect seniors living in care? Long-term care voices are still asking for stable access to adequate personal protective equipment. They are asking for regular and mass testing. They are asking for a plan to ensure the effective delivery of a vaccine. The Liberal government has not been forthcoming with a concrete plan to ensure their health and safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298668"> Either the Liberals have a plan and do not believe they need to be transparent about it or there is no plan. Canadians need answers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298669">While this motion would allow the health committee to ensure that there are real-time lessons learned to help improve our response to the pandemic, it would give the committee direction to study, evaluate, review and examine the government's response. It covers testing procurement, vaccine development, the efficiency of long-term care protocols, the adequacy of health transfers, levels of preparedness and so much more. It would also compel the government to produce documents in relation to the decisions that it has already taken during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298670"> The comprehensive motion is necessary and it is completely within the health committee's purview. This is an opportunity for the government to work with Parliament to improve its response and to ensure transparency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298671">The notion that the Liberal government would throw so much effort at blocking this motion at committee is troubling. The Liberals' all out efforts to prevent this motion raises so many questions. What do they have to hide? Why are they trying so hard to prevent Canadians from getting answers? What is so incriminating in the documents that they do not want Canadians to see it? What happened to the team Canada approach? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298672">We already know that the Liberals were slow to close the borders. They closed Canada's early pandemic warning system. They failed to maintain our emergency stockpile of personal protective equipment. They sent critical personal protective equipment to China when we did not have enough in Canada. They flip-flopped on the use of masks. They failed to keep up with our allies in the procurement and approval of rapid testing. We are lagging behind on securing COVID-19 vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298673"> What more do the Liberals have to hide that their Liberal members of Parliament on the health committee would spend hours filibustering and playing games to prevent this motion from passing? The more they protest, the more pressing it seems to become that there is greater need for accountability and transparency surrounding their COVID-19 response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298674">The Liberal government's failures cost Canadians their livelihoods and cost some them their lives. At a minimum, the Liberals should be willing to evaluate the lessons we have learned from those failures, not fighting the opposition tooth and nail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298675">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has asked Canadians to sacrifice a lot this year in the interest of public health, and they have. Canadians have sacrificed and they have given the government time to develop better responses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298676"> The only solution to the pandemic cannot be to keep shutting down our economy and just hoping for the best. That is not sufficient for Canada's seniors, who have seen the highest infection and fatality rates. It is not sufficient for Canadians who are living with compromised immunity, for health care workers who are on the front lines or for our small business owners who are barely hanging on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298700">The government has made a habit of refusing to answer even basic questions, acting offended by the very idea of being held to account. That is why we are deliberating this motion in the House today rather than at health committee, where it ought to be debated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298701"> We know that the Prime Minister's Office directed the Liberal members of the health committee to block the release of documents on the pandemic response, documents that the government has no right to block.

No, this is about people's lives and livelihoods. Canadians need clear answers on what the future holds for them, on what plans the government has made and the progress made to date. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298704">Well over a million Canadians are out of work through no fault of their own. Millions more are working fewer hours and suffering the economic consequences, with nearly all Canadians being forced at one time or another into lives of self-isolation, which has had untold consequences on their mental health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298705"> Are we really asking too much in requesting that the members of Parliament serving on the Standing Committee for Health review the impact of the government's use of the World Health Organization advice in early 2020 to delay the closure of borders and delay the recommendation of wearing masks; or the availability of personal protective equipment in Canada and a review of Canada's emergency stockpile of PPE, otherwise referred to as the NESS, between 2015 and present? Is it too much to ask the government to tell Canadians why they shut down the pandemic early warning system, or how long they can expect to wait before rapid testing kits are available or where we are at in the development of a vaccine and how long before it will be available? The government seems to think it is, and this has been the case all along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298706"> From the moment the House of Commons was recessed on March 13 until today, the government has refused to be open and transparent with Canadians. Time and time again, the Conservatives have called upon the government to clearly outline its processes and address important questions regarding its response to the pandemic, and every time the Liberals have obfuscated. Canadians rightly expect the government to adhere to the highest ethical standards when it comes to the procurement of medical equipment or PPE as well as any potential vaccines or treatments and understand that these things take time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298707">Given the motion we are debating today, we are left to surmise, as we were after Tuesday's debate, that the government has something to hide. Perhaps the information we do know regarding vaccine procurement, for example, can help us understand why the government is vehemently opposed to transparency on these matters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298708"> The Liberals have failed on numerous counts by placing all our eggs in one basket and that basket is China. China has repeatedly shown that it will not act in good faith. It has shut down the import of Canadian pulse crops on false pretenses. It has illegally held Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor as political prisoners for nearly two years and it has blocked medical supplies from being shipped to Canada, not to mention its abysmal human rights record toward the people of Hong Kong and minority communities within their borders such as the Uighurs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298709">Despite all of that, the Liberals chose China. It certainly was not for lack of other options. We had an opportunity to work on a vaccine with the University of Oxford, in a little place called the United Kingdom, one of our closest allies. Instead, their choice has left us scrambling to find alternatives and placing us at the back of the line to receive a vaccine when it finally arrives. Their troubles with a vaccine is not the only problem we know of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298710">With such an abysmal track record, I suppose we should not be surprised that the Liberals would avoid transparency as much as possible, but Canadians deserve better. As my colleague, the shadow minister for health said, at a time when it is very clear that the Liberals were unprepared for the second wave of the pandemic and Canadians are worried about their loved ones, their jobs and their futures, they deserve clear answers from the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298727">Mr. Speaker, I will pick up on what the member referenced, and that is the fact that the pandemic is the first priority, and should be the first priority, of all us in the House of Commons. There is absolutely no doubt about that. It has been the government's position since day one. Since day one, we have been working with provinces, territories, indigenous peoples, the private sector, non-profit organizations and the list goes on, so that people understand and appreciate the impact it is having around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298728">We have taken this issue very seriously. We have been working with political entities of all stripes at the different provincial levels. On occasion, yes, we have seen co-operation from opposition parties, even at times the Conservatives, but there is no doubt that the Conservative Party of Canada is playing games here in the House of Commons. There is absolutely no doubt about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298729">Then the Conservatives try to come across as if, no, not them, they are not playing any games because they are focused on COVID-19. I have been a parliamentarian for 30 years. I can understand and appreciate when I see a game being played, and they are playing a game. They say it is about lives. Yes, the federal government, working with provincial governments and other stakeholders, has saved thousands of lives across Canada because there was a team Canada approach. People came together, recognizing what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was saying, which was that we needed to deal with the pandemic. That is exactly what we did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298730">One might ask why we are here today debating yet another game by the Conservative Party. I can understand why the Bloc would want to play its game. I can understand that. Bloc members are not big fans of Confederation. I am hoping that my New Democratic friends and my friends in the Green Party will realize the game that is being played by the Conservative Party. What is really interesting is how they try to turn it around. They try to say Liberals are hiding something. They say we are the ones who are not being “democratic”. Let me expand on a couple of those points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298731">Let me quote the member who introduced the motion we are debating today, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>. I am glad she is listening very closely to this. She said, “but I think it behooves all committee members to remember that the committee is the master of its own destiny, and therefore, we are entrusted to take on studies that can look at anything we want.” That is exactly, word for word, what the mover of the motion said. I recommend that members look up the word “hypocrisy” in the dictionary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298732">We now have the very same member coming to the House of Commons with this motion, dictating to the health committee what it has to look at. There is no option. It does not matter who is on the health committee. It does not matter how many meetings it has had or that there have been over 100 witnesses already on COVID. The Conservatives do not care about that, no. Here is their agenda. This is what they want at a time when we are in the middle of a second wave. Members should think about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298733">The information that Conservatives are requesting is extensive. There could be 14 or more reports just based on the motion put forward by the Conservative Party. One of the members across the way got it right: Shame on them. Shame on themselves. Think about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298734">An amendment was moved and I asked the mover of the amendment, for just one clause, if it includes all memoranda. This is what the Conservatives want right now, within 14 days. They are saying they want all the civil servants working in those offices that have anything to do with this to stop what they are doing and focus their attention on this. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298735">If they have to make calls to the provinces, if they have to talk to others about COVID-19, or if they are working on research, who cares? According to the Conservative Party, this is what they want them to do. This is one clause and, by the way, they have 14 days to do it:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298737">That is just one aspect. The Conservatives are saying, “Who cares what the members of the health committee want to debate or study?” It does not matter to them. What matters is the Conservative Party has an agenda, and Conservatives believe they can hoodwink every other member of the House into believing that this is a good, positive way to proceed in a time of crisis here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298738">I believe the Conservative Party has it wrong, or the Conservative leadership within the party has it wrong. I have listened to some other members and to some of the speeches provided on this issue. I think a number of Conservatives might feel somewhat uncomfortable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298739">We have a standing committee, and they are critical. The Conservatives are saying that the Liberals are filibustering the committees. The poor Conservative Party of Canada: The Liberal Party does not want it to preoccupy the civil servants with its garbage, at least in part, in the fashion that the Conservatives want to deal with it. It is important stuff, there is no doubt about it, in many different ways, but the Conservatives are saying they need it and need it right away: Everyone should stop all things and get that information before the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298740"> We have committees that are asking us to hold on. They are prepared to study the important issues. They want to study the important issues that Canadians have to face regarding coronavirus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298741"> I have heard the issue of mental health is one example. Imagine the impact that the coronavirus pandemic is having on mental health in our country. I think that would be a worthy study. It is not for me to judge what would be worthy and what would not. I believe that the health committee is in a much better position to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298742">Conservatives are frustrated because they cannot get the health committee to do what they want. What they want is the only thing that can happen, so if the Liberals do not let them have it in committee, they will bring it to the House. The Conservatives feel they can trump the committee and force the committee to look at it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298743">However, a few years back the Conservatives talked, as the sponsor of this motion did, about how important it was that we respect our standing committees. Look who is not respecting those standing committees today. Look who is not interested in protecting the interests of the civil servants who are being called upon to deliver the best service they can to Canadians, whether by providing advice or participating in conferences or doing science or research: whatever it might be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298744">Instead, Conservatives are focused on committees producing papers. They want papers. They want thousands and thousands of papers in all forms. They are looking for a word: it might be “Liberal”, or it might be “<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>”, or another minister. Then they are going to say there is a huge conspiracy, another ethical scandal, and then they will hammer on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298745">That is what the Conservative focus has been, even before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> became the Prime Minister. That is why, when I stood up on Tuesday, I talked about Conservatives' priorities and the games they play, even when we are in a pandemic. I asked them to put a pause on it. There are many other things the opposition party could be doing. I know: I was in opposition for over 20 years. There are many things that they could do during a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6298746">I would think the Conservative leadership team would understand that. Conservatives make reference to the proroguing of Parliament and ask why we had a prorogation. People who are following the debate should know that the last time the House sat in the summertime was back in 1988. We sat in July and August. Yes, technically it was not a formal sitting of the House, but the House still was here and there were questions and answers were being provided. Opposition parties, all members, were afforded the opportunity to ask hundreds of questions on a wide variety of issues. Members who are interested to know what kinds of questions were asked can look at Hansard. It is there and they can read all they want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298747">We sat more days in the summer months than we lost because of prorogation, but we would not know that if we listened to the Conservatives' spin on the issue. One would think that democracy is falling because of it. The reality is that it is true only if it is convenient for the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298748">As for filibustering in committees, my goodness, has anyone ever seen a Conservative filibuster a committee? I have seen some boring stuff come from Conservative filibusters. I sat in the chamber and listened to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> speak for 14 hours on a budget, and he was talking about all sorts of little rocks and the building. There was 14 hours of it. Do you want to talk about a filibuster? I think he sat down for the last half-hour so the New Democrats or another party would be able to speak, but he prevented any other member from speaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298749">I know what a filibuster is, and the Conservatives are good at it. They are very good at filibusters, but when they do not like the filibuster then automatically it is a bad thing and is undemocratic. If my Conservative friends do not want to see ongoing dialogue and discussion in some of those committees, then maybe sit down and work out what it is they would like to be able to talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298750">I sat on committees, and generally speaking, what happens is that there is a consensus about what the agenda is going to look like and what sorts of studies will be done. There are Liberal members of that committee who are very concerned. They want to start looking into some of these very serious impacts of the COVID-19 virus. Mental health is an excellent example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298751">What about the issue of home care services? Look at the percentage of seniors who are dying as a result of COVID-19 in care facilities. Liberals, and I hope all members, should be very much concerned about that. Maybe it is time we focus the Standing Committee of Health on that issue. These are just ideas that come to my mind. I suspect if we were to canvass the members of the committee we would find there are many different ideas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298752">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, who moved this motion, said that it was the standing committee that sets the agenda and she was right. Allow them to do their job. She does not want to do that. The Conservative leadership does not want to do that now. Why? It does not quite fit what it is they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298753">I believe the Conservatives duck here, hide around there, say what it is they want and try to give the impression they are fighting for Canadians when, in reality, there has been absolutely zero change in the priorities of the Conservative Party since Stephen Harper was the prime minister and they lost the election five years ago.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6298754"> I witnessed that when I was sitting in the third party when our current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected as leader of the Liberal Party. At that time, the Conservative Party spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising, trying to tell Canadians how bad the Liberal leader was at the time. Nothing has changed. The Conservatives continue to do that, and that is why I believe that the Conservatives have zero credibility on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298755"> Even today, how many of them want to talk about scandals? I have far more confidence in the Commissioner of Ethics than I have in the Conservative Party, as all Canadians do. The Office of the Ethics Commissioner is very new to Parliament, as an independent office. Imagine if the office had been here during the in and out scandal or if it had been around here when we had one Conservative member go to jail in handcuffs? What about the Airbus incident?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298756">The Conservatives like to say, “Oh, those Liberals and the Ethics Commissioner.” The Ethics Commissioner is doing a job that we expected them to do. There will be modifications over the years as the Ethics Commissioner educates all of us in terms of what our responsibilities are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298757">The Conservatives mentioned Frank Baylis. I know Frank. Listening to the Conservatives, we would think that there is a contract between Frank Baylis and the Government of Canada. That is just not true, but yet they will still say it because they want CTV, CBC and all the TV networks to say, “There is this huge conflict.

              <ParaText id="6298775">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity this evening to raise a few issues and give the government an opportunity to respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298776">We have seen a theme since the 2015 election among the Liberals and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and the company they keep. We can break down the company they keep into two categories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298777">In the first group, we have the likes of Liberals Joe Peschisolido and Raymond Chan. As it has recently been reported, they have links to individuals charged in a gangland shooting and to the Chinese Communist Party. Then there are the bad actors in Markham, who were operating a heavily armed, illegal casino. These individuals happen to be Liberal donors. They have met with the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and interestingly donated $1 million to the Prime Minister's foundation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298778">Then there is another type of friend. I imagine members know the ones I am talking about, the ones who paid the family of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> half a million dollars and who received, in kind, a contract worth half a billion dollars. We all know the organization I am referring to. It is the one that set up a shell company to run that program, with a contribution agreement worth half a billion dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298779">Speaking of shell companies, there is also the Liberal friend, a friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who was given $237 million for a ventilator contract. Of course, that was run through a shell company. We might be seeing a bit of a theme there. The shell company is paying former Liberal MP Frank Baylis. He is the one who received this sweet contract for his ventilators that did not have regulatory approval anywhere, not just in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298780">These are just a few examples, and they really speak to the arrogance and entitlement of the Liberals and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. When questions are raised, legitimate questions, about people being criminally charged, they are very quickly cast off by the Liberals. That is a personal attack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298781">What we have is a degradation of confidence in Canadian institutions, and the cause of that is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He has twice been found guilty of breaking ethics laws, and he is under investigation for a third time. When he faces tough questions, what does he do? He shuts down Parliament; he prorogues it. He says there will be lots of time for questions later. However, when those questions get asked, what does he do? He has his members filibuster at committee. When the opposition brings important issues to the House, what happens? He threatens an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298782">Canadians are right to be concerned about the company the Liberals and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> keep, but I can say that in this place I find myself in good company, because Her Majesty's loyal opposition is willing to hold the government and the Liberals to account.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6298783">Mr. Speaker, I had somewhat anticipated that we might talk about Elections Canada and some of the issues surrounding it, particularly donation regimes and so forth. I will, like the member has done, put that to the side and take a different approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298784">It is consistent with what I just spoke about prior to the adjournment debate. The member is one of a few in the Conservative Party that is charged with the responsibility of ethics, apparently. It was many years ago, when I was an MLA, that I was asked to take on that sort of role. I have seen a lot of change over the years, a change to a higher sense of accountability and transparency in government. There are bits and pieces that I can recall right offhand that I thought were very helpful in terms of making a statement. Let me provide an example of one of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298785">When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was the leader of the Liberal Party, he was sitting in the corner where third party members sit. At the time, he stood in the House and asked for leave for what we call proactive disclosure. He asked all MPs to provide proactive disclosure on their budgets. No one would do it. Members denied it outright. We tried it on at least two occasions, though it may have even been more than that. The leader of the Liberal Party then said that, even if the Conservatives did not want to administer it for their members, he mandated proactive disclosure for all Liberal members. As a result, a few months later, the Conservatives were shamed into doing what we had suggested they do. Then a number of months later, the New Democrats did likewise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298786">I cited that example because I saw that as a step forward. When Stephen Harper established the independence of the Ethics Commissioner's office, I saw that too as a step forward. The Ethics Commissioner was going to find ways to improve our system, and that is exactly what he has done. The member referenced the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but there have been recommendations that go beyond just the Liberal Party. The Ethics Commissioner is doing what he needs to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298787">What the Conservatives have clearly demonstrated, and this member, in particular, is one of the front-runners on it, is that they know how to exaggerate things significantly. The member will say that the former minister of finance had a villa in France. I think that means it is a house or possibly a cottage. Over the summer, I actually purchased a cottage by Lake Winnipeg. I spent a long time there. I loved it. The problem is that I got in late August. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298788">We learn from the Ethics Commissioner and that is the way it should be, whether it is Conservatives being investigated and reported on or Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298789">I am wondering if the member would recognize that the Ethics Commissioner's office should be respected for the work it does and demonstrate that by saying so.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298791">It is interesting that the member talks about the establishment of the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. That was an establishment set up by the former Conservative government under former Prime Minister Harper, as was the Director of Public Prosecutions. Both of these offices ended up serving as traps that the Liberals walked right into. The DPP stopped the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from criminally interfering in a prosecution, though he attempted to, and that was the subject of the “Trudeau Report II”. Of course the first “Trudeau Report” was his first foray into breaking ethics laws. He is now under investigation for a third time. The office is doing the work it needs to do. Certainly it gets lots of business from the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6298793">I suspect the Ethics Commissioner would have also looked at the senate scandal. The senate scandal involved a wide selection of people. I think it was about a half dozen. There may have even been as many as 10 people who were directly linked to the PMO. I suspect we could have learned something from that. The RCMP was involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6298794">I look at the Ethics Commissioner and that office as being here to protect us into the future. They are not only there to say, “This is absolutely wrong. Here are these huge fines, and this is the consequence.”</ParaText>
