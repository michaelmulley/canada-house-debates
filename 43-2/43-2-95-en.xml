This is just another example of the inconsistencies between what the government says and what it does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679464">Today, I want to recognize that some of us have been privileged to work from home, taking refuge from the worst consequences of the pandemic, carried along by its steady current. Those working in hospitals, long-term care homes, fields and stores, often at minimum wage and risking their lives every day, are the ones who had to swim against the current, barely keeping their head above water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679465">Recognition is not enough. We need to act by providing paid sick leave and paid time off for vaccinations. Every worker in our country must be protected and supported. Until then, are we really all in this together?</ParaText>

Then I wondered why no one was wearing a mask or self-distancing. It turns out that back in January, Oklahomans were vaccinated by the hundreds of thousands, and now have days where they have no new cases of COVID. Here in Canada, almost no one was being vaccinated, and now we are setting records for new cases.</ParaText>

Canada should have been a leader, not at the back of the line. There will be no weddings and gatherings for Canadians this spring and summer, and we can thank the Liberals for that.</ParaText>

The petitioners agree that coercive, degrading practices designed to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity should be banned. They are also troubled, however, by the broad definition of “conversion therapy” that the bill uses. They are concerned that the definition wrongly applies the label “conversion therapy” to a range of practices, such as counsel from parents, teachers and counsellors, encouraging children to reduce their sexual behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679750">The petitioners call on the House of Commons to ban coercive and degrading practices, ensure that no laws discriminate against Canadians by limiting the services that they can receive, allow parents to speak with their own children about sexuality and gender, allow free and open conversation about sexuality and sexual behaviour and avoid criminalizing professional and religious counselling voluntarily requested and consented to by Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679755">In response to part (a)(i), the CRA is unable to provide the information as it is not captured in the manner requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679756">In response to part (a)(ii), the CRA is unable to provide the information as there is no formal breakdown of the estimated $3 billion in the manner requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679757">In response to part (b), the CRA tracks gross tax earned by audit, for federal tax, and gross revenue impact, for federal tax, plus provincial tax, plus penalties, for all of its compliance activities. In tracking additional gross tax revenue resulting from increased audit resources, the CRA formula tracks the relative increase in dollars over the historical baseline of results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679758">In response to part (c), the estimate is based on the gross federal amounts reassessed, plus audit changes that impact future revenues, and does not include a reserve for amounts that may be reversed on appeal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679793">Mr. Speaker, Alberta is facing a public health emergency unparalleled in Canada. Today Alberta has the highest rate of COVID-19 infection in the entire country. In fact, Alberta has the highest rate of infection in North America. Alberta's infection rate is double that of Ontario's and is one of the highest rates in the world. In some hot spots, such as Calgary and Fort McMurray, the rate of infection is higher than in India. The situation is so bad that last week physicians in Alberta were given instructions on a special COVID-19 protocol. It was a way to decide which patients would receive life-saving treatment and which would not. This is the first time in history that Alberta's doctors have been given emergency instructions like this. It is the first time they have been put into the situation of determining who lives and who is left to die. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679794">The reason is quite clear. Alberta's acute care health care system is on the very edge of collapse. This is a public health emergency, but it is not just Alberta's public health emergency: With a positivity rate of 13% and infection hot spots such as Wood Buffalo, where oil sands workers fly in and out from all over Canada, Alberta's COVID crisis will soon become Canada's COVID crisis if nothing is done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679795">On Monday, Alberta Health stopped testing for variants of concern, because variants have taken over. Virtually every case of COVID in Alberta is a variant of concern now. The goal must be to stop the exponential growth of infections in Alberta to save lives and not put doctors, nurses and other health care workers through the trauma of saying no to patients who desperately need help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679796"> We have an obligation as parliamentarians to address this public health crisis in Alberta. It is a public health crisis that simply cannot be contained within Alberta's borders. We have an obligation to debate the federal role in combatting it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679797">We have heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> state again and again that he has our backs and that every Canadian will get the support they need. We cannot shrug our shoulders and say this is Alberta's problem. We owe it to Albertans and all Canadians to acknowledge that what is happening in Alberta is an emergency that demands an emergency debate in the House.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6679800">Mr. Speaker, it is a “ticking time bomb”. Those are the words of the office of the Governor of Michigan in regard to the Line 5 pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679801">I will point out, and it is very important to do so, that those words are entirely inaccurate, but it is a statement that makes very clear that this is, in fact, an emergency situation for Canada. It also makes it very clear that our government has failed to take appropriate action to ensure this matter is taken care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679802">The Governor of Michigan has ordered this critical piece of Canadian infrastructure to be shut down by May 12, a week from today, and the government has failed to ensure and secure the critical continued operation of this piece of infrastructure. This pipeline is a crucial link between the energy producers in the west and the consumers in the east. Through this pipeline, Alberta fuels Quebec and Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679803">The <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> has confirmed this one pipeline alone is responsible for 53% of Ontario's crude and 66% of Quebec's. It is responsible for the majority of propane in Ontario and Quebec as well. Without this pipeline, gasoline prices would skyrocket, the economies of Ontario and Quebec would crash and propane supplies would completely disappear, wiping out farmers, shutting down warehouses and threatening heating and life-saving equipment at hospitals that are already stretched beyond capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679804">This is not just a threat to tens of thousands of direct jobs in Sarnia, Montreal, Quebec City and the province of Alberta, but to 40 million Canadians and Americans who rely on the products produced by these refineries for the necessities of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679805">In short, the shutdown of this pipeline would cause catastrophic economic damage to Canada at a time when COVID-19 has already created an incredible burden on Canadian workers. It would also create catastrophic damage from an environmental perspective, because shutting down Line 5 would be an environmental disaster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679806">The shortfall that would result would mean Canada would have to obtain energy from far less environmentally friendly sources. It would also mean the potential for transport by truck and rail rather than through a pipeline, which is the far more environmentally friendly alternative. It would require approximately 2,000 trucks or 800 rail cars each day to make up for the shutdown of this pipeline. Neither of those options is good for either our economy or our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679807">With this in mind, I would ask that you accept this request for an emergency debate, pursuant to Standing Order 52, so members of Parliament can debate this very urgent economic and environmental crisis for our country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6679809">Mr. Speaker, I have been quite eager to stand up and add to my question of privilege. I would like to respond, just very briefly, to the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation>'s intervention on my question of privilege concerning the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> deliberately misleading the House about when he knew of the sexual misconduct of General Vance in 2018. I will let my submission of last week stand, as presented, but I want to make a few additional comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679810">The <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> raised the matter of my reference to the emails from Janine Sherman, the deputy secretary to the cabinet responsible for Governor in Council appointments, where Ms. Sherman sent a draft email that the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> could use to respond to Mr. Walbourne. This is what the government House leader actually said: “While she does not include the words 'allegations of sexual harassment', I can only speculate that she was making an assumption.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679811">The <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> offers the speculation that someone is assuming, and this someone is not just anyone; she is the deputy secretary to the cabinet, and the person speculating on the assumption is a minister of the Crown. This is all the more reason, Mr. Speaker, for you to rule this to be a prima facie question of privilege and have the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs get to the bottom of this important matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679812">I will not go over the three tests applied to the question of privilege. I made my submission on that subject and I know the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> offered his version. However, there is another important application that Speakers rely on that is just as important, and in many cases more important, when considering questions of privilege that I would like you to consider, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679813">I ended my original submission referencing Maginot's second edition of <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, at page 227, where he suggests that if the Speaker feels any doubt on the question, he should leave it to the House. This citation is from a ruling from March 21, 1978, page 3,975 of Debates, where the Speaker cites the report of the U.K. Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, and from a ruling of October 10, 1989, at pages 4,457 to 4,461 of Debates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679814">In another ruling, from October 24, 1966, at page 9,005 of Debates, the Speaker uses the same application when referring to the member at the time who was raising the question of privilege. I am going to quote what it says:</ParaText>

If we take into consideration that at the moment the Speaker is about to render a decision as to whether or not the article complained of constitutes a breach of privilege ... and considering also that the Speaker is the guardian of the rules, rights and privileges of the House and of its members and that he cannot deprive them of such privileges when there is uncertainty in his mind ...

              <ParaText id="6679819">Casting further doubt on the innocence of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was the fact that on the same day the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> made his submission on the question of privilege, the Liberal chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence unilaterally cancelled the meeting where the committee was prepared to invite the Prime Minister's chief of staff to bring some clarity to this issue. Many viewed this as an attempt to cover up and conceal the truth about what the Prime Minister knew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679820">As you know, Mr. Speaker, the authorities are consistent about the need for clarity in our proceedings and about the need to ensure the integrity of the information provided by the government to this House.

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6679859">Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have done everything necessary to protect Canadians’ health and safety, to help businesses weather the storm and to position our country for a strong recovery. After 14 months of uncertainty and hardship, Canadians continue to fight COVID-19 with determination and courage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679860">Right now we are being hit hard by the third wave, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. More and more Canadians are getting vaccinated. The recovery is around the corner. The bill before us today would implement our plan to finish the fight against COVID-19, create jobs, grow the economy and ensure a robust recovery from which all Canadians would benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679861">The budget I presented to the House on April 19 contains further details about the plan. The budget focuses on middle-class Canadians and seeks to help more Canadians join the middle class. It is also in line with the global shift to a green, clean economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679862">This plan will help Canadians and Canadian businesses heal the wounds left by COVID-19 and come back stronger than ever.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6679863">This budget meets three fundamental challenges. First, we must conquer COVID. That means buying vaccines and supporting provincial and territorial health care systems. It means enforcing quarantine rules at the border and within the country. It means providing Canadians and Canadian businesses with the support they need to get through these final lockdowns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679864">Second, we must punch our way out of the COVID recession. That means ensuring that lost jobs are recovered as swiftly as possible and hard-hit businesses rebound quickly. It means providing support where COVID has hit hardest: to women, to young people, to racialized Canadians and low-wage workers, and to small and medium-sized businesses, especially in tourism and hospitality. When fully enacted, this budget will create, in total, nearly 500,000 new training and work opportunities for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679865">Third, the major challenge is to build a more resilient Canada: better, more fair, more prosperous and more innovative. That means investing in Canada's green transition and the green jobs that go with it, in Canada's digital transformation and in Canadian innovation, and it means building infrastructure for a dynamic, growing country. This budget invests in social infrastructure and in physical infrastructure. It invests in human capital and in physical capital. It invests in Canadians and it invests in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679866">Vaccine campaigns are accelerating, and that is such a good thing, but we need to vaccinate even more Canadians even more quickly. Thanks to plentiful and growing vaccine supply, that is something team Canada can get done working together. This legislation proposes a one-time payment of $1 billion to provinces and territories to reinforce and roll out vaccination programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679867">Canadians should take advantage of our increasing vaccine supply and, when it is their turn, go and get the first Health Canada-approved vaccine available to them. I was vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine nine days ago at a Toronto pharmacy, and I am so grateful I was able to be vaccinated when it was my turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679868">COVID-19 has placed extreme pressure on health care systems across the country. The pandemic is still with us and Canadians do need help urgently. That is why we propose to provide $4 billion through the Canada health transfer to help provinces and territories address immediate health care system pressures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679869">These funds are in addition to our unprecedented investments in the health care systems during the pandemic, including the $13.8 billion invested in health care under the safe restart agreement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679870">A full recovery from this pandemic requires new, long-term investments in social infrastructure, from early learning and child care to student grants to income top-ups, so that the middle class can flourish and so that more Canadians can join it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679871">COVID-19 has brutally exposed what women have long known: Without child care, parents, usually mothers, cannot work outside the home. A cornerstone of our jobs and growth plan is a historic investment of $30 billion over five years, reaching $9.2 billion annually in permanent investments when combined with previous commitments, to build a high-quality, affordable and accessible early learning and child care system across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679872">Within five years, families everywhere in Canada should have access to high-quality child care for an average of $10 a day. This will help increase parents', and especially women's, participation in the workforce. It will create jobs for child care workers, more than 95% of whom are women. It will give every child in Canada the best possible start in life. Early learning and child care has long been a feminist issue. COVID has shown us that it is an urgent economic issue as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679873">As we make this historic commitment, I would like to thank the visionary leaders in Quebec, and in particular Quebec feminists, who led the way for the rest of Canada. I am very grateful to these women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679874">Of course, the plan also includes additional resources for Quebec that could be used to provide further support for its early learning and child care system, a system that is already the envy of the rest of Canada and, indeed, much of the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679875">We also recognize the continuing need to bridge Canadians and Canadian businesses through this tough third wave of the virus and into a full recovery. To date, the Canada emergency wage subsidy has helped more than 5.3 million Canadians keep their jobs. The Canada emergency rent subsidy and lockdown support have helped more than 175,000 organizations with rent, mortgage and other expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679876">The wage subsidy, rent subsidy and lockdown support were set to expire in June 2021. Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> extends these measures through to September 25, 2021, for a total of $12.1 billion in additional support. Extending the support will mean that millions of jobs will be protected, as they have been throughout this crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679877">To help people who still cannot work, we also propose maintaining flexible access to employment insurance benefits for another year, until fall 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679878">We also plan to extend the number of weeks for certain major income support measures, including the Canada recovery benefit and the Canada recovery caregiver benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679879">We are providing an extra 12 weeks of benefits to recipients of the Canada recovery benefit, which was created to help Canadians who are not eligible for employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679880">Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> also proposes extending the Canada recovery caregiver benefit by 4 weeks, up to a maximum of 42 weeks at $500 a week. This will help when the economy begins its safe reopening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679881">For caregivers who cannot find a solution, especially those who take care of children, the employment insurance sickness benefit will be extended from 15 to 26 weeks.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6679882"> Canada's prosperity depends on every Canadian having a fair chance to join the middle class. Low-wage workers in Canada work harder than anyone else in the country and for less pay. In the past year, they have faced both significant infection risks and job losses. Many live below the poverty line, even though they work full time. We are Canadian, and this should not be acceptable to any of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679883">Through Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>, we propose to expand the Canada workers benefit to invest $8.9 billion over six years in additional support for low-wage workers. This will extend income top-ups to about a million more workers and will lift 100,000 Canadians out of poverty. This legislation will also introduce a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679884">Young people have made extraordinary sacrifices over this past year to keep us, their elders, safe. We must not and we will not allow them to become a lost generation. Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> would make college and university more accessible and affordable. This legislation will extend the waiver of interest on federal student and apprentice loans to March 2023.

              <ParaText id="6679904">Madam Speaker, it has been well over two years since the last budget was tabled in the House. After all this time, one would have expected that our Liberal friends would have gotten it right. Instead, budget 2021 is a massive letdown. Instead of building back better, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had so vacuously promised, and focusing on job creation and long-term growth, this budget has left us with bigger debt, bigger deficits, an avalanche of unfocused spending and a much bigger and more intrusive government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679905">Our Conservatives have repeatedly supported emergency programs for struggling Canadians to make it through the pandemic. What we cannot support is the Liberal government's failure to address the most urgent health and economic issues facing our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679906"> The virus has inflicted untold damage and put intense pressure on our health care system. Health care workers and hospitals are under siege. Even today, only 3% of Canadians have received their second dose of vaccine, while in the U.S., 32% of Americans have been fully vaccinated. How can that be?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679907">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has failed to put forward strategic investments to ramp up vaccinations and provide the help the provinces and territories have asked for, as they struggle to contain the virus and treat the thousands of sick and dying patients. In fact, he has refused to sit down with those provinces to discuss health care support. Instead, the Prime Minister has said that he will get around to discussing this once the COVID pandemic is over. The premiers had asked for one thing, and that was a reliable federal partner to help them in the fight against COVID-19. They did not get one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679908">The budget also fails to live up to the Liberal government's own financial commitments. For example, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> had originally signalled that $100 billion of additional spending would be used to stimulate the economy, but only if absolutely necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679909"> Today, the parliamentary budget officer noted that in fact a good portion of the spending was not used to stimulate the economy at all. In classic Liberal fashion, much of the so-called stimulus was instead spent on measures intended to further the political interests of the Liberal government. The PBO even noted that the Liberals could have reduced Canada's massive deficits by more than $100 billion over the next six years. Instead, they chose to spend that money on an avalanche of election goodies to buy the votes of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679910">The minister's own mandate letter from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> instructed her to present a new fiscal anchor, in other words, rules and safeguards, to guide her management of the massive debt and deficits that the Liberals had created. Yet, the best she could do was to recycle the old debt-to-GDP ratio, but this time without any firm targets. What is very clear is that the government has no intention of ever returning to balance, even in the longer term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679911">The PBO's newly released report for parliamentarians highlights a number of other things. First, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s stimulus has been miscalibrated. That is his term. In other words, it missed the mark. Second, the finance minister failed to distinguish between stimulus spending and COVID spending. I would suggest that she may have conflated the two to hide the fact that much of the spending was, indeed, election related. The PBO also said that the Liberals had overstated the economic impact of the stimulus. In other words, they misrepresented and oversold the value of the stimulus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679912"> We also found out that the Liberal government had left itself no fiscal room. In other words, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has maxed out our country's credit card and ability to make future investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679913"> Finally, the PBO confirms that the government is not on course to return our debt and deficits to pre-pandemic levels, another big fail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679914">However, to be sure, there are some measures in the budget that Conservatives support, for example, the extension of the emergency support measures like the wage subsidy, the rent subsidy and other recovery benefits as well as the hiring and training program for employers to maintain a level playing field and allow them to transition from the wage subsidy program. There is an improved tax treatment for capital investment over a two-year time frame and there is some support for hospitality, tourism and culture, although not the support required to reflect that these sectors were the hardest hit, the first to be shut down and will likely be the last to reopen.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6679915">Quite frankly, what I heard from tourism stakeholders is that they do not want handouts. What they want is for the government to come up with a plan to safely reopen the economy and let them do what they do best, which is to sustain and create good-paying jobs. Sadly, they did not get that plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679916">In the lead up to the budget, we had sent the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> letters outlining the measures we believed were critical to fuelling our post-pandemic recovery. Unsurprisingly, almost all our advice was ignored, including on child care. Instead of building on existing family support measures that would deliver immediate relief to parents wanting to enter the labour force, the Liberals recycled an old promise to create an Ottawa-knows-best one-size-fits-all regulated day care program, one that will leave millions of Canadian parents behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679917">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> herself acknowledged just now that it would take at least five years to get this program in place to negotiate child care agreements with the provinces. Meanwhile, parents wishing to enter the labour force right now will be left hanging. Liberal leaders have made the very same child care promise in almost every election since 1993 and have never, ever delivered. Canadians have a right to skeptical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679918">Remember, this was supposed to be a growth budget. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised. Therefore, will this budget actually grow the economy and position us for long-term prosperity? Not at all. In fact, high profile Liberals like the Prime Minister's former economic adviser, Robert Asselin, have acknowledged this budget is not about long-term growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679919">Today's PBO report confirms that significant elements of this budget were misrepresented by the Liberal government and overstate the stimulus and growth effects on our economy. As other countries provide their citizens with faster access to vaccines, they are also beating us to the punch by giving their economies a shot in the arm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679920">The U.K. has launched an infrastructure revolution. Italy has introduced what its Prime Minister has called “the mother of all reforms” to slash red tape. France and Germany are cutting taxes. Japan is helping its firms reduce their reliance on China with a shift toward more reliable and ethical trading partners. What did the Liberal budget do? It sprayed billions of dollars around without a clear strategy to position Canada for long-term prosperity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679921">The budget has no investments to address the structural problems that have plagued productivity and our ability to compete on the global stage. There is no plan to address the unprecedented level of investment that is fleeing Canada. There is no plan for regulatory and tax reform to help us win on the global stage. There is no comprehensive innovation strategy to ensure Canadian tech start-ups keep their job-creating investments here at home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679922">The budget is largely silent on our world-leading natural resource sector, one of the most significant contributors to our national prosperity. The Liberal government has again turned its back on our oil and gas producing provinces by expressly excluding the sector from the new carbon capture tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679923">The Liberal government also missed a golden opportunity to substantively address the skyrocketing cost of housing in Canada. The budget introduces a 1% tax on foreign owners of vacant housing, which, quite frankly, will be considered an inconvenience to wealthy foreigners who will simply treat this as a cost of doing business, especially when we see the appreciation property values year over year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679924">Meanwhile, millions of Canadians are seeing their dream of home ownership slip through their fingers. That is a major failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679925">I believe Canadians are looking for hope that things will soon get better and that we still have a bright future to look forward to. They want their jobs and small businesses back. They want their lives and communities back. Simply put, they want a return to normal and to live the Canadian dream. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679926">This budget fails to deliver. There is no growth plan, only spending on an unprecedented scale, and spending is not an economic plan.</ParaText>

Last month, in places such as Burlington, Oakville, Milton, Georgetown and Acton, Halton region was only able to vaccinate 90,000 residents. It could have vaccinated 216,000 residents, or 7,200 residents a day, more than double the number of people it actually vaccinated. The reason only half the number of people were vaccinated was because of a lack of vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679959">I will quote Halton region directly, which stated, “While we have the capacity to book approximately 7,200 appointments per day through our clinics, the availability of consistent vaccine supply continues to constrain the Vaccination Program rollout.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679960">The budget does nothing to fix this lack of vaccines. As a result, we are experiencing a third wave, unlike countries who were able to secure an adequate supply of vaccines like the United States and the United Kingdom.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679962"> The budget has no plan for regulatory and tax reform to help us in a fiercely competitive global economy. It has no plan to address Canada's chronically low levels of productivity, the only long-term determinant of prosperity. It has no plan for Canada's natural resources sector, which is so important, and the race for critical minerals and the energy transition heats up. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679964">Members do not need to take it from me. They can take it from the experts. This is what David Dodge, the deputy minister of finance during the Chrétien government of the 1990s and former governor of the Bank of Canada, had to say about the budget in The Globe and Mail. He stated, “My policy criticism of the budget is that it really does not focus on growth”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679965">Referring to growth and the finance minister, he continues, “over the longer haul, we face a very real challenge. And I don’t think she tried to seriously address that in the budget”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679966">He went on to say that the vast majority of the extra $100 billion in spending is consumption not investment. He also said the budget does not have a prudent fiscal plan. He stated, “To me, it wouldn’t accord with something that is a reasonably prudent fiscal plan, let me put it that way”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679967">According to the International Monetary Fund, Canada has incurred the largest deficit among major economies in the last year at 20% of our GDP, yet the IMF estimates that, compared to our economic peers, Canada's economy has contracted more and will recover more slowly. Despite this, the budget does nothing to create jobs and growth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6679968">There is no plan in the budget to balance public finances. The budget itself indicates that in the next five years alone, interest charges on the national debt will double, increasing from about 20 billion dollars a year to about 40 billion dollars a year.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6679969">Other experts have also been critical of the budget, as my colleague just said in his most recent remarks in the House. Here is what the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s former policy and budget director, Robert Asselin, had to say about the budget in The Hub. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679970">He said, “The federal budget has no answers on the question of growth”. He went on to say, “it was clear for some time that the government’s decision to spend more than $100 billion in so-called short-term stimulus was a political solution in search of an economic problem.” He concluded by saying, “After doubling our federal debt in only six years, and spending close to a trillion dollars, not moving the needle on long-term growth would be the worst possible legacy of this budget.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679971">This budget has no plan for growth, no plan to make Canada more competitive on the global stage and no plan to deal with Canada's aging labour force and chronically low levels of business investment. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has noted that a significant amount of the spending in the budget would neither stimulate jobs nor create economic growth. Like many others, he has concluded that a good portion of the spending is not stimulus at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679972">Much of the spending in the budget is designed to help get Liberals re-elected. It is clearly a pre-election budget with a shotgun approach to spending. For example, the budget promises a national child care program. They do not mind the fact that it is provincial jurisdiction and some provinces have already set up universal child care programs. They do not mind the fact that the social union framework agreement, which was negotiated in 1999 by a previous Liberal government, requires the government to get the support of the majority of provincial governments to proceed. They do not mind the fact that provinces are rightfully skeptical about a federal government setting up new shared-cost programs in provincial areas of jurisdiction, only to have the federal government reduce funding at a later date, leaving the provinces on the hook to make up the deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679973">This promise of a national child care program is one Canadians have every right to be skeptical about. The Liberals first made this promise in the infamous red book of 1993, some 28 years ago. Over the last 28 years, they have continued to trot it out, and they keep failing to deliver. The government had two years to prepare for this budget. The fact that after two years all they could come out with is a budget soaring in rhetoric, but lacking in substance, is not surprising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679974">This is a government with an unprecedented gap between its rhetoric and reality. It is a government that said it was about gender equality, yet forced out of its cabinet and caucus the first indigenous female <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">minister of justice</Affiliation> and forced out of its caucus Jane Philpott, someone whose medical expertise we could have desperately used as minister of health during the last year of this pandemic. It is a government that said it was feminist, yet ignored the specific allegation of sexual harassment against the head of the armed forces</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679975">It is a government that said it would introduce electoral reform. It is a government headed by a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who arrogantly proclaimed to the world in 2015 that Canada was back, and who made it a centrepiece of his foreign policy to secure a seat for Canada on the UN Security Council. However, Canada lost the vote for the Security Council seat with six fewer votes than it received a decade earlier. It is a government that came to office promising to do more for the world's poor, but that has spent 10% less on official development assistance than the previous government. It is a government that came to office promising to do better on climate change, but emissions have risen each and every year it has been in office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679976">In 2016, the first full year the current government was in office, emissions were 708 megatonnes. Just last month, the government announced emissions for the latest year, 2019, at 730 megatonnes. This is a 22-megatonne increase from its first full year in office, when it stood at 708 megatonnes, and so, too, it is with this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679977">This is a government that says it is focused on the middle class. It says it is focused on jobs and growth and focused on fiscal prudence, yet it presents a budget that is focused on anything but. For all those reasons, I cannot support this budget.</ParaText>

It is clear that both the United States and the United Kingdom botched the early response to the pandemic a year ago. That is clear. Their cases skyrocketed. They had many more cases than we did. However, they eventually pulled up their bootstraps and they have led the world, not just the free world, in vaccinating significant numbers of their own citizens to the point now where over 50% of Britons now have been vaccinated and almost 50% of Americans have been vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6679983">We have not done anything well during this pandemic. The fact that we are now going through a third wave with a third set of restrictions is reflective of that.

He has a constituent who had advocated, with huge energy and personal passion, for extending the EI sickness benefit from 15 to 26 weeks. The parliamentary secretary spoke to me about the personal story of this constituent. In his view, based on his constituency work as a MP, this was a measure we needed to put in place, as sick Canadians needed longer support. We acted on what he proposed, and I am very, very glad we were able to do that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680039">Madam Speaker, that is not what we are hearing on the ground. We are hearing a lot of grumbling about the creation of two classes of seniors and the exclusion of seniors aged 65 to 74. From our point of view, this is not being well received on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680040">I would like to start by informing the House that the Bloc Québécois will support the principle of the bill. We will make amendments in committee and review our position in subsequent votes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680041">This implementation bill is mammoth in scope. It has 346 pages, four parts, 37 divisions and four schedules. The summary alone is 10 pages long. It goes without saying that it contains tonnes of measures, like the woolly mammoth, which could weigh up to six tonnes. We obviously support most of the measures, such as the ones aimed at extending support programs like the wage and rent subsidies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680042">Given the mammoth scope of the bill and the time I am allotted, I will limit myself to a brief overview, stopping to discuss some of its elements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680043">Part 1 contains a series of highly technical amendments to the Income Tax Act. It limits the stock option deduction for large companies. It increases the basic personal deduction to $15,000. It prohibits bonuses for senior executives in companies receiving the wage subsidy, and introduces anti-avoidance measures. These are some of the measures we support. Part 2 imposes GST on Internet and Airbnb purchases, which is obviously a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680044">The bill extends the wage subsidy until September 27, gradually reducing the rates from 75% to 20%, and also allows the minister to extend the program by regulation for two more months, until November 30. During these two months, the minister could also make a regulation concerning eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy as well as its calculation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680045">This provision sounds like an insurance policy in case the House is dissolved for elections, preventing it from enacting a law that would extend the wage subsidy beyond September 27 if necessary. If you read between the lines, the choice of November 30 gives you an idea of when the current government anticipates the House to be back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680046">The bill creates a new hiring subsidy program for businesses restarting their activities. The hiring subsidy will be in effect from June 6 to November 20. It will be offered to businesses restarting their activities and hiring or rehiring employees. It could cover up to half of new salaries. Businesses will therefore be able to choose between the hiring subsidy and the wage subsidy, depending on which one benefits them most. These are measures that we support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680047">As I said in my question to the minister, division 5 of part 4 is a serious problem for us. This section involves the centralization of the securities commission, which infringes on Quebec's jurisdiction. With this division, the federal government is trying to strip Quebec of its financial sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680048">Bill C-30 renews and significantly increases the budget of the Canadian Securities Regulation Regime Transition Office to expedite its work. The bill authorizes the government to make payments to the transition office of up to $119,500,000 or any greater amount that may be specified in an appropriation act. The transition office was established in July 2009 to create a single pan-Canadian securities regulator in Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680049">There have been a number of setbacks before the Supreme Court, which deemed that securities were not under federal jurisdiction. However, Ottawa finally got the green light in 2018—remember it well—to interfere in this jurisdiction provided that it co-operate with the provinces and not act unilaterally. That is what is on paper, so that is the theory. However, as Yogi Berra said, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680050">If the federal government carried out its plan to establish a pan-Canadian securities regulator in Toronto, we would inevitably see a creep of regulation activities outside Quebec. This plan is just bad and must never see the light of day. This is more than just a dispute over jurisdictions or mere squabbling between Quebec and Ottawa or the federal government and the provinces. This is a battle between Bay Street and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680051">I would like to remind the House that everyone is against this in Quebec, including all political parties in the Quebec National Assembly, business communities, the financial sector and labour-sponsored funds. Seldom have we seen Quebec's business community come together as one to oppose a government initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680052">In addition to the Government of Quebec and the National Assembly, economic circles unanimously and vehemently oppose it, including the Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec, the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal, Finance Montréal, the International Financial Centre corporation, the Desjardins Group, Fonds de solidarité FTQ, as well as most Quebec businesses, like Air Transat, Transcontinental, Canam, Québecor, Metro, La Capitale, Cogeco, Molson, and the list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680053">A strong Quebec Autorité des marchés financiers means a strong talent pool in support of the financial legal framework, a prerequisite to the sector's development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680054">When the Toronto Stock Exchange bought the Bourse de Montréal, the Commission des valeurs mobilières, the predecessor to the Autorité des marchés financiers, demanded before authorizing the sale that Montreal retain a stock exchange. We know that it specialized in derivatives, including the carbon exchange.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680055">In Quebec, the financial sector represents 150,000 jobs with a contribution of more than $20 billion, or the equivalent of 6.3% of the GDP. Montreal is the 13th largest global financial centre with nearly 100,000 jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680056">The provisions in division 5 are an attack on our ability to keep our head offices and preserve our businesses. We are talking about the Quebec model. The Task Force on the Protection of Québec Businesses estimates that the 578 head offices in Quebec represent 50,000 jobs with a salary that is twice as high as the Quebec average in addition to 20,000 other jobs at specialized service providers such as accounting, legal, financial or computer services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680057">Quebec companies tend to favour Quebec suppliers, while foreign companies in Quebec rely more on globalized supply chains and all the impact that can have on our network of SMEs, in the regions in particular. We saw with the pandemic that globalized supply chains are fragile and make us entirely dependent on foreign supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680058">Ultimately, businesses tend to concentrate their strategic activities, in particular research and development, where their headquarters are located. There is also a branch plant economy and a less innovative economy. These are threats to Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680059">A strong financial hub is vital to the functioning of our headquarters and the preservation of our businesses. Keeping the sector's regulator in Quebec ensures that decision-makers are nearby, which in turn enables access to capital markets for businesses, an essential condition to support business investment and growth across Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680060">The Bloc Québécois wants to eliminate division 5 of Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>, by deleting the clause in question. This would be tantamount to cutting off funding for the centralization of Toronto's financial sector. We are sorry, but we will be standing in Bay Street's way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680061">I will move on to division 8 of part 4.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680062"> Division 8 enacts a new act, the retail payment activities act, which would govern all electronic transactions. It applies not only to online payment activities of federally regulated institutions but also to those of all businesses. Even provincial governments are subject to this law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680063">At this point, we have serious concerns about division 8. In our view, the activities described are essentially private in nature and fall under civil law. Why is Ottawa sticking its nose in? There is also the possibility that the federal legislation may not apply to a non-federally regulated business in a province that has passed comparable legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680064">The Bloc Québécois and I find this all rather vague. Is this yet another encroachment by Ottawa into the area of financial consumer protection? We have questions. We are going to look into the matter and shed some light on it. Our constituents can count on us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680065">We all remember a mammoth bill introduced by former minister Morneau that removed the Bay Street financial sector from the Civil Code of Quebec. We managed to get the government to back down and we are ready to do it again, if needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680066">I will now move on to division 22.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680067">Here, Bill C-30 amends the Canada Labour Code in an effort to address the issue of contract flipping.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680068">Unfortunately, this contract flipping is still happening in airports. It involves replacing one company with another less expensive one through competitive bidding. What does the new company do? It rehires the same workers to do the same job but with inferior working conditions and wages. That is unacceptable. It is straight out of another century. It is time for that to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680069">We welcome that division of the bill. However, it seems that it refers only to pay and not to all of the social benefits and other benefits set out in the collective agreement. In fact, the collective agreement does not seem to be transferred. We will therefore continue to examine that division of the bill and possibly make some improvements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680070">Next, I want to talk about division 23, which increases minimum wage to $15 an hour. Obviously, we applaud that initiative. The Bloc Québécois is always in favour of improving the quality of life and working conditions of Quebeckers and Canadians. However, members need to be aware that only a minority of workers, or approximately 26,000 Canadians, will be able to get that wage increase, because the Canada Labour Code applies only to federally regulated sectors, so this measure is nothing too spectacular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680071"> Division 25 provides for a payment to Quebec to offset the cost of aligning the Quebec parental insurance plan. For once, Quebec may not have to fight for its share of the funding allocated to a program it opted out of. We hope Ottawa will remember this way of doing things and do it more often. That would be nice sometimes instead of always wasting time haggling over money for social housing, roads and lots of other things, money that takes years to get transferred. We applaud what is being done here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680072"> I will move on to division 32, which is about old age security, but before I talk about old age security, what do we have here in division 32? A $500 cheque for people 75 and over this summer, right before the election. People probably remember how Duplessis gave folks refrigerators so they would not forget which side to vote for. Well done, Liberals. Duplessis used to say that heaven was blue and hell was red. Unfortunately, the Liberals cannot appropriate that particular Duplessis slogan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680073">As I said earlier, division 32 will increase old age security by 10% for those aged 75 and over, not this summer, but in the summer of 2022. That is $63 more per month. I would remind the House that the Bloc Québécois is asking for an increase of $110 per month for all seniors aged 65 and over, starting immediately. This would bring Canada back in line with the OECD average. Canada would still lag far behind Europe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680074">On that topic, I would like to quote the economic analyst Gérald Fillion. In a very interesting article he wrote recently in response to the budget, he said, and I quote:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Two questions come to mind. First, why not increase old age security by 10% as of this year? Second, why do these measures apply only to seniors aged 75 and over? Why not those aged 65 and over?</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680076"> Those are very legitimate questions that we too want to ask the government. The FADOQ network and seniors' groups in Quebec also spoke out against this approach. Gérald Fillion made a number of points. He noted that, in Canada, people's income drops precipitously when they retire. The technical term is net pension replacement rate, which was 50.7% of pre-retirement income in Canada in 2018. That translates into roughly half as much after retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680077"> Across the OECD, that rate is seven percentage points higher. In the European Union, it is 63%. The figures are therefore 50%, 57% and 63%. These data are from a study of 49 countries, among which Canada ranks 32nd, well behind countries such as Italy, India, France and Denmark, and just slightly above the United States, where inequality is surging. That is not impressive. These statistics are alarming, so we must take action. Seniors were the first victims of the pandemic, and there was already inequality before the pandemic.<Sup /></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680081">I will now move on to division 34, which deals with child care services. The government is giving itself the right to compensate a province that wishes to opt out of the federal early learning and child care program.

Can the government finally guarantee that Quebec will receive full compensation every year, without conditions, for what it has been doing since 1997? That is what we want, and that is what we are asking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680085">I would like to remind members that the new pan-Canadian child care program is another federal intrusion. Family policies and all associated programs are the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. It is clearly a good policy, a worthwhile, feminist policy, but it is still an intrusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680086">I will now move on to divisions 35 and 36, which grant 12 additional weeks of the Canada recovery benefit, bringing us to September 25 of this year. The total number of weeks is now increased to 50, which is a good thing. For the first four additional weeks, recipients will receive $500 a week. For the other eight weeks, the maximum will be reduced to $300, starting July 18. This division also extends the Canada recovery caregiving benefit by four weeks to a maximum of 42 weeks, providing $500 a week in the event that caregiving options are not sufficiently available. The maximum number of weeks for which the benefit can be paid to people living at the same address is 42.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680087">The bill contains several measures, including extending EI benefits, which may be prescribed by regulation and extended until November 20, if necessary; maintaining EI eligibility at 420 hours; and extending the maximum length of EI sickness benefits from 15 weeks to 26 weeks starting in the summer. I do not mean this summer, but the one following the election. This measure continues to penalize people who are fighting cancer, for example, and need more weeks of benefits. It does not take into account the order that the House gave the government to extend the benefit period to 50 weeks. Twenty-six weeks is better than 15, but that was not what the House voted for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680088">I remind members that the Bloc Québécois voted against the budget. Although we believe the budget contains some worthwhile measures, it overlooked the key issues, namely proper funding for health care and proper support for seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680089">The Bloc Québécois also denounces the government's decision to use the budget to set up infrastructure that would enable it to interfere in provincial jurisdictions. The budget provides for frameworks for mental health care, women's health and reproductive health. These are all the exclusive jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680090">The budget also provides for a framework for extracting the minerals needed for the green transition. Furthermore, as I pointed out earlier, the government is once again talking about a Canadian securities regulator. The budget also talks about a federal office for recognizing foreign credentials, which is not a federal jurisdiction. There is also mention of a Canadian water agency and a federal framework for skills training. Whenever Quebec or the provinces do something good, Ottawa tries to latch on, even though it is not able to take care of its own jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680091"> This is all very troubling. All of these measures, frameworks and policies do not represent significant amounts in the budget, but they reflect the government's intention to set up the infrastructure to keep moving in this direction. We will be keeping an eye on the government, that is for sure. The government's vision is to control specific areas that, according to the Constitution, fall under provincial jurisdiction. The federal government has the power to spend, and that enables it to stick its nose into everybody's business, but as a result, we are becoming less and less of a federation with provincial autonomy and more and more of a centralized country where everything happens in Ottawa. The federal government could not care less about the provincial autonomy that Quebec holds so dear. The provinces are being starved. With health care costs rising and Ottawa refusing to co-operate, Quebec and the provinces have no more room to manoeuvre. If they want some breathing room, they need to turn to Ottawa, which will tell them how to do things. That is very troubling.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680138">I would like to underscore today, sadly.

Today is Red Dress Day, when we commemorate their lives and we recommit to fight for accountability, dignity and justice and to say that there will be, one day, no more stolen sisters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680139">I have only a few minutes to start the debate today, but I would like to set the table talking about a tale of two countries during this pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680140">During this pandemic, we have seen one country, a country of very ultrawealthy Canadians, billionaires who have seen their wealth increase by $78 billion during this pandemic, an astounding amount. At the same time, we have seen unprecedented supports showered on the banking sector to maintain bank profits, $750 billion in liquidity supports, which has led to, so far in the pandemic and we will have the latest figures in the next few weeks, over $40 billion in profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680141"> This flies in the face of every other crisis we have come through, where there has been a sense that we are all in this together and that the ultrarich have to pay their fair share. Notably, in the Second World War, an excess profits tax ensured that we had the wherewithal to fight Nazism and fascism and to rebuild, most vigorously, our economy, putting in place record investments in health care, education, housing and transportation in the postwar period. Sadly, that is not the case through this pandemic with the current government, which has allowed the ultrarich to benefit, to profit and to profiteer in an unprecedented way and refuses even to ask them to pay their fair share of taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680142"> There is another country in this tale of two countries, and that is regular Canadians who have been struggling through this pandemic. We have seen Canadians losing their jobs. We have seen Canadians who have invested in their family-owned community businesses for years having to take that sad step of closing the door and turning the key for the very last time. We have seen students struggling to pay for their student loan during the course of this pandemic, as if paying back a Canada student loan should be their priority, rather than putting food on the table or keeping a roof over their heads. We have seen people with disabilities who have struggled and, through this entire pandemic, in about a third of cases with people with disabilities, they have received a $600 one-time stipend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680143">I contrast that with the land of the billionaires and the banks, with $750 billion in liquidity supports, $78 billion in increased wealth and $42 billion in profits. Throughout this pandemic, we have seen our inequalities exacerbated. We have seen more and more that difference between the ultrawealthy and all the privilege they get from the government, and the struggles that regular Canadian families are having to go through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680144">I must shout out to our frontline workers, the health care workers and the emergency responders, all of whom have been struggling with all of the financial challenges of this pandemic, often with no supports at all, and at the same time are showing, with great courage, their ability to continue to fight and contribute, fight for people's lives and support Canadians in the health care system, as first responders or as frontline workers. This is the contrast—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680150">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to get the opportunity to speak a little further on Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>, an act to amend the Income Tax Act regarding transfer of a small business, a family farm or a fishing corporation, which is sponsored by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680151">As members know, Bill <Document DbId="11300724" Type="4">C-208</Document> is now at third reading stage. How did it get here? Simply put, Bill <Document DbId="11300724" Type="4">C-208</Document> has had considerable debate in the House and was referred to the finance committee, which I chair. I will make a few comments on what witnesses had to say before committee in a moment. The finance committee referred the bill back to the House without amendment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680152">Bill <Document DbId="11300724" Type="4">C-208</Document> has a long history, and it criss-crosses the political landscape. It was first introduced by the current member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="252662" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation>, a Liberal, two parliaments ago. In the last Parliament, the same bill was brought forward by Guy Caron, an NDP member. Now, in this current Parliament, it is sponsored by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>, a Conservative member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680153">This long history, across all major political parties in the House, certainly shows that there is a need to bring fairness and equity from a taxation perspective to the transfer of family farm corporations, fisheries enterprises and small family businesses. Quite honestly, it is long past time that this problem was fixed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680154">During an earlier discussion at third reading, it was suggested by the government spokesman that just maybe the bill could provide opportunities for tax avoidance. I would agree that tax avoidance is a legitimate concern. However, I must point out that at the finance committee we heard from 17 witnesses, and every opportunity was given to address the concern of tax avoidance. We called on the public and Finance Canada to provide witnesses and propose amendments, to anybody who had those kinds of concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680155">I certainly appreciate that the assistant deputy minister of the tax policy branch and the senior director of the tax legislation division in the tax policy branch appeared and answered questions, and their comments appear in the transcript for the finance committee for anybody who wants to see it. To be fair, they did outline some concerns, especially as it relates to what is called “surplus stripping” for the purpose of tax avoidance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680156">Where does that leave us? On the one hand, we have concerns being expressed by officials, and I do take their concerns seriously. On the other hand, we have a broad section of witnesses who expressed a serious and immediate need for a way to transfer a small business, farming corporation or fishing enterprise without facing unfair taxation when transferring to a family member. We do not see amendments to the bill that would fix this alleged problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680157">I would even agree with those who might say that private members' bills are not the best vehicle to change tax policy. They are not. However, we simply cannot allow this inequity disadvantaging intergenerational transfers to family members to continue. It is time to accept the only change that is on the table to fix the problem, and that happens to be Bill <Document DbId="11300724" Type="4">C-208</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680158">The sponsor of the bill, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>, gave about the most concise and clear example of this inequity in the tax system. He said:</ParaText>

If the father were to sell his farm to a stranger, he could use his capital gains exemption on the sale, resulting in an effective tax rate of 13.39%. However, if the farmer sold his farm to his son, that sale would be recorded as a dividend rather than a capital gain, and the farmer would pay 47.4% in tax. That is a huge difference, and I think we can all agree that it is completely unfair. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6680164">The backbone of many communities are small businesses, farmers and fishermen.

              <ParaText id="6680165"> It is absolutely true that during this pandemic the federal government has been there in every way possible to support Canadians, businesses, farmers and fishermen. Tax policy, however, should not cause a disincentive to transfer to the next generation. Tax fairness should be the cornerstone on which to encourage intergenerational transfers. This bill would move tax policy in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680166"> Finance Canada, and the government for that matter, always have the option to put forward corrections in a ways and means motion if concerns expressed before committee do arise in reality. That, in itself, is a safeguard. They have the ability to do that fairly quickly through a ways and means motion. However, farmers, fishermen and small business owners, with respect to the unfairness of this taxation system, have been waiting for this change for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680167"> We have to put the shoe on the other foot. Instead of having those families that want intergenerational transfers sitting in the wings waiting for something to happen, we have to pass this bill and put the shoe on the other foot. If there is a problem, then government has the ability to fix that problem. I am encouraging others to recognize this problem. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680169">Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague on his speech, which was interesting. My speech will be along the same lines as his, as it was all very sensible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680170">In his speech, my colleague said that Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208, an act to amend the Income Tax Act</Document>, is not partisan. The bill does not belong to the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the NDP or the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680171">In fact, since there were no questions and comments following the remarks by the previous speaker, I would like to point out an oversight. I believe it was an oversight. Perhaps not, but I hope it was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680172">He mentioned some of the previous versions of this bill intended to facilitate the transfer of family businesses. Yes, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252662" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> did in fact introduce legislation to facilitate the transfer of family businesses when he was in opposition a few years ago. Yes, it is also true that the former member for Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Guy Caron, had also introduced legislation to facilitate the transfer of family businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680173">However, my colleague may have forgotten that the member speaking right now, in other words me, also had the opportunity to introduce Bill <Document DbId="8283905" Type="4">C-275</Document>, which sought to facilitate the transfer of family businesses. I introduced it at roughly the same time as my former colleague from Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques. In fact, as we were announcing the introduction of this bill, my former colleague from Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques thought it was such a good idea that he quickly introduced his bill as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680174">There was a bit of a friendly competition about doing the right thing. We wanted parents who want to hand down their business to their children to stop being penalized. This only makes sense, because it is good to see a family's achievement carry on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680175">Now it is the Conservatives' turn to introduce a similar bill. At the time, when they were in government, the Conservatives were against it, but now they support the cause. Of course we are very pleased to see that, but we are still disappointed to see that the current Liberal government does not seem to want to support the bill. It is hard to understand. How is it that when the Liberal and Conservative parties are in the opposition they want to do the right thing, but when they are in power they do not? That is quite disappointing, to say the least.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680176">When this type of bill is introduced, many people pay attention to the ongoing debates. When the bill was introduced, and then when we began debating it, I immediately alerted certain businesses in my riding as well as some people I went to school with who also wanted to take over their family businesses. After seeing so many bills fail, they were all excited and hoped that this one would come to fruition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680177">In the meantime, after so many bills failed to pass in previous parliaments, the Quebec government decided to act. Quebec changed its tax legislation to allow the transfer of family businesses. It would seem that the federal government is frozen and incapable of moving forward. When either the Liberals or the Conservatives come to power, everything suddenly stops and fails to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680178">I am making a heartfelt plea, which I believe echoes the pleas of the people who have been contacting me. They want to know what progress has been made on this bill and whether it will pass. Sometimes I tell them that even if my bill does not pass, some measures might well be included in a budget. In several economic updates and even in some budgets, the government stated that it would work to facilitate the transfer of family businesses and that it would examine the legislation to make certain improvements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680179">Once again, the government is giving people hope. People are thinking that maybe the government is finally going to do something. It is disappointing, because year after year there is always a holdup. Is it an administrative problem or does the bill run counter to some kind of interest? I do not know who would have an interest in preventing families from passing their business from one family member to another.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680180">Passing a business on to the next generation is not easy. It is rare. People often say that it is difficult to transfer a business and to encourage their children to take over the family business. When their children do want to take over, why are we stopping them from doing so? Why would we financially penalize those who pass their business on to family members but not penalize those who do not? Why is it more profitable to sell one's business to anyone other than one's own children?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680181">For example, I could sell my business to a stranger and make more money. There are many parents who have to think about that option. Obviously, all parents want what is best for their children, but when they see that passing their business on to their children could, in some cases, cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars, many of them have to stop and think about whether doing so is financially viable for them. Not all business owners have millions of dollars put away. Often these business owners invested in their business thinking that they would use it for their retirement. They therefore want to be able to benefit from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680182">This is creating quite the dilemma for people. If they pass their business on to their children, then they may have to forgo their retirement. It is really disappointing to see that this situation has not yet been resolved. That is why I wanted to speak today, to bring to light this issue, this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680183">We also have to look further ahead. What happens when there is no one in a family to take over the business? The owner has to seek out someone else, approaching businesses or people who are already well established, such as a competitor, a bigger company. That is what poses a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680184">Family farms can disappear when they are taken over by larger farms. I have nothing against large farms, by why not let small businesses exist and prosper, run by people who are working for themselves and being their own boss? I think that would be nice. However, we are faced with a bill that hinders that possibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680185">If we let farms disappear, if we let small businesses disappear because there is nobody to take them over, we are making other people think it is not easy to start a business or start a farm. Ultimately, if we want to allow those transfers, if we want to avoid seeing mega-businesses and mega-farms that are held by shareholders and operated by absentee executives and managers who live who knows where or are very far away from the customer, the consumer, we have to be flexible and attentive to this concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680186">I studied accounting. Business owners and I are not the only ones saying we are frustrated. We are also hearing that from accountants, accounting students and professors, who have been saying for ages that the government is not interested in listening or understanding. We were hearing it back in the early 2000s, when I was in university. Professors did not understand why the government was not doing something about this issue. All the students were appalled to learn that, by law, this kind of capital gain was considered a dividend, which meant at least twice as much tax had to be paid on that gain. Financially, that hurts. Like it or not, money influences these decisions and affects the young people who would like to take over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680187"> As I see that my time is almost up and I do not want you to interrupt, Madam Speaker, I will conclude with a heartfelt plea. I implore the government to finally listen to the wishes of the business world, small businesses, members of the House and members of the Standing Committee on Finance and to do the right thing by supporting and passing this much-needed bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680188">Madam Speaker, it is a great honour to be standing virtually in the House and speaking to Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation> for being the sponsor of this bill. He is the latest in a fairly long line of MPs who have been trying to achieve this legislative proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680189">I was present in the 42nd Parliament when my former colleague, Guy Caron, brought in Bill <Document DbId="8283999" Type="4">C-274</Document>, and I remember his passionate speech in the House of Commons during its second reading. He was trying to illustrate the reasons why that legislation was so important. It was great to witness that speech, but ultimately it was very disappointing to see the vote results when the Liberal government at the time used its majority to prevent the bill from going any further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680190">I am glad to see this time it has been different, by virtue of the fact that we are in a minority Parliament and the opposition used its combined numbers to send this bill to the Standing Committee on Finance where it had a good airing. We got to hear from many witnesses, and ultimately the committee decided to send the bill back to us for our final consideration. It is my sincere hope that this bill will be sent off to the other place and that we can look forward to royal assent, hopefully in the near future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680191">When Bill <Document DbId="8283999" Type="4">C-274</Document> was being considered in the previous Parliament, I had a meeting with the Port Renfrew Chamber of Commerce. I was given a 10-minute speaking spot during their AGM, and when I talked about Bill C-274 at that time and about what we were hoping to do, I got unanimous positive feedback from the members of that chamber. For those who do not know, Port Renfrew is on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island. Many people there depend on fishing for their livelihoods. They are either commercial fishermen or are in sport fishing, so they have small fishing corporations. To have the ability put forward to transfer their businesses to family members really meant a lot to them. There was overwhelmingly positive feedback. I ultimately had to give them bad news, but here we are with a real opportunity to try to bring about some positive change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680192">This bill is pretty much tailor-made for the types of small businesses that exist in the riding I represent, Cowichan—Malahat—Langford. Like so many members before me, I want to acknowledge the pain and suffering that small businesses have gone through over the last year. I think it is incumbent upon us not only to have support programs to help them through the pandemic, but also to bring about long-term systemic change to important statutes such as the Income Tax Act, so that we can make their business operations and their succession planning that much easier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680193">My riding is dominated by farming as well. Here in the Cowichan Valley we have a beautiful climate. It is, I think, Canada's only Mediterranean climate and we have a very long and storied agricultural history. We have generational family farms here. Some have the fifth generation of a family farming the same plot of land. If we can bring about legislative change that makes succession easier and gives them peace of mind, I think we are doing a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680194">I also want to give a shout-out to the five chambers of commerce in my riding: Chemainus, Cowichan Lake District, Duncan Cowichan, Port Renfrew and WestShore. They have all been incredible advocates for their members. I have been staying in touch with them quite consistently over the last year and their feedback during this pandemic has been invaluable in helping me, as a member, advocate on their behalf in Ottawa to make sure that the federal government's policies and programs are reflecting their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680195">I will concentrate mostly on family farms, given the nature of my riding and the fact that I am the NDP's critic for agriculture and agri-food. When we look at family farms, we are looking at $50 billion in farm assets that are set to change hands over the next 10 years. History has shown us that roughly 8,000 family farms have disappeared over the last decade.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680196">The National Farmers Union has done an incredible report on the status of Canada's farms, called “Tackling the Farm Crisis and the Climate Crisis”. It not only looks at agriculture in the context of climate change, but also the financial footing that many farms are on and how shaky it is. According to the NFU, Canadian farm debt has doubled since the year 2000. That is in 21 short years. It was listed at $106 billion in 2019. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680197">Many farms have to chase income from off-farm work, taxpayer support programs and other farm sources. That is just a reality for so many small farms. What is really concerning is that we have lost two-thirds of our young farmers since 1991. The family farm is pretty much being systematically destroyed in Canada, and we need to put measures in place that are going to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680198">Why is Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> so important? The owners of small businesses, family farms and fishing operations who want to retire want to be able to sell to their children because it is often their children who have been brought up in the family business and on the family farm. From a young age they have learned the culture of the business and what it does, and they often have a lot invested in that business continuing to succeed. The next generation often has very important ideas about where to take that business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680199">When parents decide to sell their business to their children, the difference between the sale price and the price originally paid is currently considered a dividend, but if they sell their business to an unrelated individual or corporation it is considered a capital gain. Unlike capital gains, a divided does not include the right to a lifetime exemption and is taxed more heavily. We can make a measurable improvement in allowing families to pass on businesses that might have been part of a family for generations to their children, making it easier for that work to get done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680200">I want to recognize the work done at the Standing Committee on Finance. I appreciate the witnesses who appeared. Many of them also appeared at the agriculture committee. We heard important testimony from the CFIB, the Grain Growers of Canada, L'Union des producteurs agricoles and, of course, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, which has been such an incredibly important voice for farmers from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680201">They noted at committee that the average age of Canadian farmers is now above 55, and the opportunities these businesses face will carry into the next generation. It is a sector in which the vast majority of businesses remain family owned, and maintaining the financial health of those businesses across generations is critical. At committee, the CFA very clearly said that it supported Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> because it would ensure that real family farm transfers could access the same capital gains treatment as businesses selling to unrelated parties, rather than treating the difference as a dividend that was taxed at a higher rate and not being able to access the lifetime capital gains exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680202">We have an important opportunity before us. During the vote at second reading, I was sad to see that 145 Liberal MPs voted against this bill. Two Liberal MPs supported it. It is my sincere hope that when this bill comes to a final vote to be sent to the Senate, Liberals can finally see this as an important opportunity and can represent the interests of small businesses, family farms and fishing corporations by making this much-needed change to the Income Tax Act and doing right by their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680203">I, for one, will be proud to vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> and send it on its journey. I look forward to the day when we can finally see it receive royal assent. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680204">Madam Speaker, what a privilege and honour it is to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. Not often in the House do we find a private member's bill that has all-party support, and this is one of those unique situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680205">For many small business owners, business succession is an important factor to consider when planning for the future. This is no surprise. When they spend so much of their time and energy pouring hour after hour into running their operation, what happens to the fruits of their labour when it is time for them to retire or move on matters to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680206">However, surveys tell us that only about half of small businesses have a succession plan. I suspect that is because they are caught up in the day-to-day running of their businesses. However, whether they are thinking about succession early on or are confronting succession decisions near the time of transition, somewhere along the line these entrepreneurs face a frustrating reality: It is more expensive to sell an incorporated small business, or a family farm or fishing enterprise, to a family member than to a stranger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680207">What is behind this? When a business is sold to a family member, it is considered a dividend. When sold to a stranger, it is considered a capital gain and is eligible for capital gains exemption. In its simplest form, when selling to a family member the tax rate is higher for the seller than when selling to a stranger. That tax rate is significantly lower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680208">This is not right, and it is not fair. About half of small business owners are hoping to sell or transfer their operations to family members when it is time for them to move on. If members have spent even a little time around family-run businesses, the “why” becomes clear. Sometimes kids are raised in the business and learn the ropes at a young age. They come to know the ins and outs of the business better than anyone. They put in the time, they know the customers and they are established figures in their communities. When the time comes for succession, they are an obvious option for so many reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680209">This is where Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> comes in. It seeks to achieve tax fairness for business succession by amending the Income Tax Act to level the playing field. It would allow a small business owner the same tax rate when selling their operation to a family member as when selling to a third party. It would correct the injustice within the act that unfairly punishes individuals when they sell their qualifying small business, farm or fishing operation to their own family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680210">During the finance committee's study of the bill, Brian Janzen, a senior tax manager with Deloitte, gave an example to help members understand just how stark the financial difference currently is between selling to a family member and selling to a stranger. He said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680219">These are the considerations for many small business owners looking at succession planning. There needs to be a level playing field that empowers owners to make the best choice for them and their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680220">The current inequity is a reality that impacts a variety of types of small businesses, but I want to take a moment to talk about farm families specifically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680221"> Agriculture is incredibly capital intensive, and as Scott Ross of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture told the finance committee, “effective succession planning is critically important, particularly for a sector that will transfer tens of billions of dollars in assets to the next generation in this decade alone.” Uniquely, the agriculture sector continues to be one where the vast majority of farms, even though they are incorporated, still remain family owned. This has considerable advantages for all Canadians since, as Mr. Ross highlighted, “studies show that family farming encourages sustainable growth, environmental stewardship and increased spending within one’s local community, not to mention its contributions to the social fabric of rural Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680222">I share several commonalities with the bill's sponsor, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>. For one, we were both elected in the same 2013 by-election. More importantly for today's discussion, we both have “farmer” on our resumes. We are very familiar with the immense benefits that farming and agriculture provide to the communities we represent. By passing Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>, the House can acknowledge the tremendous contributions that our farmers make and can help ensure tax fairness for farm succession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680223">Throughout debate on this bill, we have heard some members suggest that this change will just benefit the rich or create opportunities for tax avoidance. I want to address this head-on because that is a mischaracterization that finance committee testimony swiftly put to rest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680224">The bill includes tax-avoidance safeguards mandating that the family member who purchases the operation must maintain their shares for a minimum of five years to avoid penalization. As Deloitte senior tax manager Brian Janzen confirmed, “This bill is helping the lower end of the small business community. It is not helping the huge, rich companies, even if they're family owned.” He also told the finance committee that Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> has enough guardrails to prevent tax avoidance, even as he urged vigilance so that tweaks could be made if required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680225">Like all colleagues, I wanted to make sure that the bill did not providing an undue benefit to large corporations. I therefore asked Mr. Jansen very specifically about those concerns. He said it did not benefit large corporations, “partly because of the guardrails you have in this bill, but also because for the larger companies...section 84.1 and the capital gains exemption didn't even come into play. The numbers are big enough that this is just...not material to the larger private businesses. This is really helping the small private business.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680226">It is clear that this bill strikes the right balance between providing tax fairness and preventing abuse. I encourage any members who feel differently to review the testimony before the finance committee. They will see experts addressing these concerns and urging the bill's swift passage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680227">There were 145 Liberal members who voted against this common-sense bill at second reading. Meanwhile, members of all the opposition parties supported it, and so did two Liberal MPs. I sincerely appreciate the two Liberal members who voted in favour of this bill. They recognized the positive impact that it would have on their constituents. I hope that the testimony we have heard since that time will help other Liberal MPs better understand why they ought to lend their support to Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. Their constituents deserve tax fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680228">I want to wrap up by saying thanks to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation> for introducing this pertinent legislation. His efforts are going to make a real difference in the lives of many small business owners and farm families. We have seen iterations of this bill brought forward by multiple parties over the years, and this goes to show that there is cross-party support for this bill. It is time to get it over the finish line.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680230">Madam Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to speak to this bill at third reading stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680231">At its annual general meeting, the Syndicat de la relève agricole d'Abitibi-Témiscamingue called on MPs from the Abitibi-Témiscamingue area to support Bill C-208 and to actively contribute to its passage before the next election. That is my role today in bringing debate to a close at third reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680232">The resolution of the Syndicat de la relève agricole d'Abitibi-Témiscamingue speaks of fairness when transferring agricultural farms. At present, when an individual sells their shares in their small business or family farm corporation to a family member, the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price is treated as a dividend. However, if the business or corporation is sold to someone other than a family member, this transaction is treated as a capital gain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680233">Bill C-208 would give small businesses, farming families and fishing families the same tax treatment whether they sell their business to a family member or a third party. The economic landscape of our region is made up of a growing number of incorporated farms and family fishing corporations, which is why the Syndicat de la relève agricole d'Abitibi-Témiscamingue adopted this resolution, and I am here to honour it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680234">I had the opportunity to take part in the debate on this bill in November 2020, and I remember that my presentation centred on the fact that, incredible as it may seem, a business owner is currently better off selling their business to outside shareholders than to members of their own family. As I said, under the existing legislation, the transfer of a business to a family member is treated as a dividend and not as a capital gain, unlike a sale to a third party. As a result, owners are not entitled to the lifetime capital gains exemption if they decide to sell the business to their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680235">The Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill C-208. For several years now, my party has been calling for measures to encourage and facilitate the transfer of family businesses, especially in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. I would also like to acknowledge the work of my colleague, the member for Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères, who had the opportunity to speak before me and who introduced Bill <Document DbId="8283905" Type="4">C-275</Document> back in the day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680236">The Bloc Québécois has been calling for measures to encourage and facilitate the transfer of family businesses for over 15 years. For Quebeckers, the Bloc Québécois and myself, business succession is important. It is also important for our SMEs in general, but especially for family farms in the regions, like the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. Perhaps we will soon have the opportunity to speak of Bill C-208 and its consequences in the past tense, a thought that fills me with excitement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680237">The existing legislation makes no sense at all. What is prompting the Liberal Party to vote against Bill C-208? They are raising the possibility of tax abuse and tax fraud, but we know that the Parliamentary Budget Officer questioned the amount of money that the Liberal government estimated would be lost, calculating that it would be tens or hundreds of millions instead of billions of dollars. Speaking of losses, I still do not understand why the government is not cracking down on tax havens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680238"> I would like to share the comments of a farmer from my riding, a friend of mine named Simon Leblond, who was the president of the Fédération de la relève agricole du Québec when I was working for the union. With regard to the transfer of family farms, he said that it is important to maintain a large enough pool of farmers to maintain services for farms and, more generally, to ensure the vitality of the industry, make it known to those outside the world of agriculture, and ensure interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680239">Farmers face major challenges, and I think it is important to point that out. Some of the challenges faced by farmers in Abitibi-Témiscamingue and everywhere else include land grabbing, farmland financialization, the whole issue of income security, vet services for farm animals, crop insurance and agricultural drainage. These are major challenges, and improving access to land and quality of life for Quebec's young farmers is one way to ensure a future in agriculture for Quebec's youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680240"> The more people we have who are willing to take over farms, the more services we will be able to provide. It is a cycle, but unfortunately that cycle has been broken. I hope that we can get that cycle going again and that we will see more and more young people taking over farms. Land prices, quota prices and new forms of agricultural production are leading to higher costs every year, and the red tape is becoming increasingly cumbersome, making it harder and harder for farmers to access land and operate their business. As politicians, we have a responsibility in that regard. I repeat: It is not right that a business owner is better off selling the business to a third party than to their own family members.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680241">The Government of Quebec included measures in its 2016 budget to facilitate the transfer of family businesses in the primary and manufacturing sectors. A change to Quebec's Taxation Act relaxed the rule that prohibited the seller from using the capital gains tax exemption. Quebec has addressed this issue, while the federal government still lags behind, or at least it was lagging until now. I remind members that the Parliamentary Budget Officer assessed the cost of these measures, and his figure was lower than what the federal government was claiming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680242">I want to get back to the speech my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253051" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> made about Bill C-208 at second reading. I want to make a little aside, though, and I want to acknowledge and commend our colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>, for his leadership. I would like to congratulate the Conservative Party for its leadership in this debate, because Bill C-208 has been given priority on two occasions at third reading. That is why we are debating it today. I hope that we will be able to vote on this bill by next week so that it can be sent to the Senate and then get royal assent. That would be the blessing that so many have hoped for. I will give some examples soon, but I just wanted to mention that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680258">Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to a very important bill that would positively impact countless farmers and small business owners across Canada if passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680259">I want to sincerely thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>, for introducing the bill to Parliament and making so much progress on this issue. I am fortunate to work with my Manitoba colleague, who gained my profound respect for representing his constituents in an exceptional manner throughout his tenure as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680260">Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, would provide tax fairness for farmers and small business owners across our nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680261">This may surprise most Canadians, but selling a farm or a small business to an unknown third party receives better tax treatment than selling that same business to a family member. The current structure of the Income Tax Act penalizes farm and small business owners from transferring their operations to a member of their own family. This discrepancy in tax treatment can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in more taxes if sold to family as opposed to a stranger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680262">For example, imagine a couple who has owned a local auto repair shop in Manitoba for decades and is ready to retire. These owners have worked hard to support their family and community and their business is now worth $1 million. The couple is approached by a multinational auto repair company that has no roots in the community but wants to buy the business. If owners were to sell their business to this unknown third party, they would incur $29,000 in taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680263">Their son is also interested in buying the local business as he looks to raise a family and make a living in the community in which he grew up. However, if their son were to purchase the same company at the same price, his parents could pay up to $466,000 in taxes, a tax difference of $437,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680264">Now the couple who owns the auto repair shop must make a decision. Do the owners sell to the multinational company and maximize their retirement fund or do they sell to their son and keep the business in the family? Why should small business owners be placed in a position to choose between sacrificing their retirement fund or sacrificing the word family in their family business? The answer is obvious: they should not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680265">However, thousands of business owners spend their entire careers operating their businesses with the expectation of passing it to their children. They do not realize the staggering tax difference they will be indebted with until they part ways with their business. This puts retirement and business plans at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680266">The constituency of Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa is built on the foundation of small business and agriculture. These sectors are the lifeblood to the vibrant rural communities of our region. I was raised and spent my entire life in rural Manitoba. I understand how these businesses support our communities and the families within.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680267">Last year, I spent a year touring rural Manitoba to meet specifically with small businesses to hear their priorities and concerns. One of the most prominent things I heard was the concern of what the future would look like in rural populations as aging and younger generations moved to urban centres. Many rural communities rely on a single business to provide a good or service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680268">I think of the No. 5 Store in the rural town of Riding Mountain, located between the community of Neepawa and Ste. Rose. This family run business is the only supplier of essential goods and services to the Riding Mountain community. Locals rely on the No. 5 Store for their everyday essentials like groceries and mail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680269">Small businesses like these provide families with goods and services needed to successfully make a living in rural communities. If businesses like these close their doors, communities suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680270"> Large multinational companies will never replace the locally owned family businesses that are the engines of rural Canada. Family-owned small businesses are what give rural communities their identity. We must support them in transferring their businesses to future generations so they can endure. Without small businesses, rural Canada evaporates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680271">Agriculture is another pillar to our country and to the region I represent. Family farms contribute immensely to the social and cultural fabric of rural Canada. However, by 2025, one in four farmers will be 65 or older and over 110,000 farmers are expected to retire within the coming decade. This means thousands of farmers will be transferring their farm operations as they retire.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680272"> I should remind the members of the House that farmers are the people who have a strong connection to the land. They care deeply about keeping their farm in the family in the hopes of watching their children take the same care of the land in the manner they did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680273">There something to be said about the family farm. The family farm is not just a business, it is not just an operation; it is generational and sentimental. It is a way of life for hundreds of thousands of Canadians and their families. The family farm is an ideal and it is an ideal worth preserving. However, it is clear that agriculture is approaching a demographic revolution and as parliamentarians, it is our duty to support such a massive transition to ensure the future prosperity of Canadian agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680274">Unfortunately, under the current tax regime, farmers are unable to transfer their family farm to the family without experiencing unfair tax treatment. As parliamentarians, we need to work creating more sustainable rural Canada through job creation and economic prosperity. Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> would do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680275"> Bill C-208 would keep the family in the family business. It would provide a future for the family farm. It would create fairness for countless Canadians as well as preserve the rural communities that are the bedrock to our nation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680276">Madam Speaker, my colleagues have outlined all the details at second reading, third reading and previous iterations of this bill, so I will not go into those right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680277">Tonight, I want to begin by thanking all those who have helped get Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> to this point. Without my Conservative colleagues trading the speaking spots for their private members' bills, we would never have gotten to third reading before the summer recess. I am immensely thankful to them for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680278">For my colleagues from Prince Albert, Saskatoon—Grasswood and Regina—Qu'Appelle, I am eternally grateful for their support and assistance. For that support, I want them to know we are on the cusp of passing the legislation and sending it to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680279">I have spoken to numerous MPs over the past year about the importance of correcting this massive injustice within the Income Tax Act. The purpose of this bill is straightforward. It will level the playing field by giving families the exact same tax treatment whether they transfer their businesses or operations to their children or to a stranger. It will result in more locally owned and operated businesses, as has been outlined by many of my colleagues who have spoken to the bill, the types of businesses that are involved in their communities and provide steady employment for countless individuals. It will help keep farms and fishing operations in the family as well as any other qualifying small business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680280"> Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> would send a message of hope to young farmers who want to carry on what their families started. Most of all, it would bring tax fairness to the Income Tax Act. No longer will parents have given a false choice of having to choose between a larger retirement package by selling to a stranger or a massive tax bill because they have sold to a family member, their own son, daughter or grandchildren. Every single community in Canada will be positively impacted by the passage of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680281"> As I said in my speech two weeks ago, there is bipartisan support for the legislation. I want to recognize and thank not only my colleagues from Provencher and Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa for their kind words and informational speeches, but also the members of other parties for their speeches and support at second reading, third reading and at committee as well as all the witnesses who gave testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680282">In particular, I want to thank my colleague from Malpeque, who also happens to be the chair of the finance committee, who announced he would be voting in favour of Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. I thank him for his kind presentation in the House today as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680283">While I know my Liberal colleague from Winnipeg North, and I know him very well, is well-intentioned, I found that during his speech on the legislation a couple of weeks ago, his comments were quite off base. I know, had he taken the time to read the evidence and testimony provided at the finance committee, he would have known his speaking points and the concerns given to him by the finance department were all truly addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680284">For my Liberal colleagues, who, for the most part, all voted against the bill at second reading, I know the process. I know the party whips and the powers that be have likely told them to vote against the bill. However, I implore them to listen to their constituents who want this legislation passed, review what the tax experts have said and reach out to their businesses, farms or organizations in their ridings and ask them if they support the bill. I can assure all my colleagues that if they do reach out, they will find almost universal support for Bill C-208. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680285">Once and for all, we can finally resolve this long-standing problem that countless families have had to endure when selling their businesses or operations to their immediate children or grandchildren.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680286">I look forward to the final vote next week and kindly ask all my colleagues to support the bill, thus allowing for the debate in the other place and passage of it into law.</ParaText>

It is an extremely important debate, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to stand and represent my constituents and represent all people in Alberta and across Canada who are deeply concerned about what is happening in my province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680298">We are here tonight because Alberta, my province, is in crisis and that crisis is threatening all of Canada. Once again, Alberta reported nearly 2,000 new cases of COVID-19 today. Alberta's per capita rate of infection is the highest in Canada, nearly double that of Ontario. It is the highest rate of infection in North America and one of the highest rates in the world. In some locations in Alberta, the rate of infection is higher than in India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680299">ICUs in Alberta are nearing capacity. There is no more room for acute COVID patients. There is no more capacity in the health care system to deal with this crisis. Alberta's acute care health care system is on the verge of collapse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680300">Late last week, Alberta Health Services instructed physicians to review a new protocol, the critical care triage framework. The framework is designed to guide physicians in case of “a dire situation” where “the demand for life-sustaining critical care support is greater than the available resources”. In other words, for the first time in history, Alberta's doctors have been given emergency instructions on how to determine which patients will receive life-saving treatment and which ones will not, instructions to determine who lives and who dies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680301">As I am sure everyone in Canada can appreciate, Alberta's physicians are not pleased that it has come to this. Edmonton doctor Noel Gibney, who co-chairs the Edmonton pandemic response committee, said that the implementation of the triage framework would be devastating for physicians, for nurses and for other front-line health care workers. He said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680302">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It would put significant moral distress on ICU doctors and nurses because we would see patients who would typically, although very sick, with appropriate critical care treatment would normally survive but instead those individuals would be referred to palliative care.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680303">On Monday, 50 critical care physicians, including Dr. Gibney, wrote an open letter to Premier Jason Kenney warning that there were not enough critical care health workers in Alberta to handle more cases, begging the premier to do something to stop the exponential growth in cases, and yet, last night, in a highly anticipated prime-time announcement, he refused to take questions from reporters. Jason Kenney failed once again to lead Alberta through this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680304"> If members want to know why it is so bad in Alberta, why other provinces have withstood the third wave better than my province, the answer is clear: It is Jason Kenney. From the very beginning of this global pandemic, he has failed Albertans. His Donald Trump-like approach to COVID-19 has put us where we are today: in a state of absolute crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680305">At the beginning of the global pandemic last year and through wave after wave of infection, Jason Kenney has bowed to the worst elements of his political base, downplaying the lethal threat that COVID-19 poses and instead belittling efforts to stop the transmission of the virus. He has referred to the coronavirus repeatedly as nothing more than a flu, even after medical experts alerted us that calling COVID a flu was misleading and damaging to public health efforts and even after we had seen the devastating impact COVID-19 has had on our seniors, especially those living in long-term care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680306">Just like Donald Trump, Premier Kenney promised that the flu would go away. Rather than shut down schools to prevent transmission, Jason Kenney claimed that there was no transmission in schools. When his own government data suggested otherwise, when we saw outbreaks in school after school, he shut down contact tracing of cases in schools because, of course, they cannot report on what they refuse to measure. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680307">My children are in those schools. I send my children to school every day and it is terrifying. It is terrifying for my children, but it is also terrifying for those teachers who had to be on the front line, who were not prioritized for vaccinations. It is terrifying to know that every day they may be bringing COVID home. They may be bringing COVID to their neighbours, their families. It is devastating. My son's best friend has come down with COVID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680308">In August I brought forward the unanimous consent motion asking the Government of Canada to put $2 billion toward a safer restart, a safer reopening for schools and $262 million of that went to Alberta schools. We were depending on the federal government to step in. We could not count on our provincial government to do what it needed to do to protect teachers, to protect students, to protect our loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680309">Rather than address infections in homeless populations, Jason Kenney claims that the homeless somehow have immunity to COVID-19, stating that they have “a very high level of immune resistance against an influenza of this nature”. Again, it is “an influenza”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680310">Our seniors were dying and the seriousness of COVID-19 was downplayed by comparing the average age of those dying at the time, which was 83, with the average life expectancy of age 82. It was so callous and cruel. Everybody else has been to blame for the failures that have happened in Alberta. There are stories of birthday parties and that was why there was transmission. There is the blaming of the South Asian community for high rates of transmission in Calgary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680311">Last week, I stood in the House because Jason Kenney blamed high rates of infection in Wood Buffalo on indigenous people, when he knows, when I know, when we all know, that the high rates in the area are from work camps serving the oil sands. Wood Buffalo is just one hotspot in Alberta, but it is an important one, because rising infections there could lead to the rapid spread throughout the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680312">In Alberta, oil and gas workers were deemed essential by Jason Kenney's United Conservative government. That means that dozens of oil sands workers have been flying in and out of the area from all over Canada since the beginning of the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680313">Perhaps the biggest failure has been the dance around COVID restrictions. I believe, honestly, this is the biggest lesson all of us need to take from this pandemic. The failure to acknowledge the reality of COVID-19 and to commit to ending its spread is devastating to our health, our lives, our economy. We have seen time and time again that half measures do not work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680314">Throughout this pandemic I have to say Jason Kenney has been the king of half measures. One day he is placing restrictions; the next day he is playing them down. He wants to rely on personal responsibility rather than government action, but that has left Albertans in a devastating position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680315">Last week in the face of overwhelming evidence from around the world that restrictions are highly effective at stopping the spread of infections and one of the only ways to fight COVID-19 other than vaccines, we were told it is “a false idea” that lockdowns stop the viral spread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680316">Now, thanks to Jason Kenney's lack of leadership, thanks to the provincial government telling police authorities not to enforce the few restrictions in place, thanks to the bumbling, stumbling joke that our provincial government has become, we have the single greatest public health crisis Alberta has ever seen. Despite all this, despite the highest rate of infection in North America, despite the crisis in our ICUs, I am still the only member of Parliament from Alberta to call out Jason Kenney and this nonsense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680317">With a positivity rate of 13% this week, infection hotspots like Wood Buffalo mean that Alberta's COVID crisis will soon become Canada's COVID crisis if nothing is done. We are in a race between vaccines and variants. This is true everywhere in Canada and it is true all around the world, but we are losing the race in Alberta. On Monday, Alberta Health Services stopped testing for variants of concern. The reason is that the variants have taken over.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680318">Virtually every case of COVID in Alberta is a variant of concern now. If left unchecked, the COVID petri dish that is Alberta promises to create more variants. It is a matter of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680319">The goal now must be to stop the exponential growth of infections in Alberta; to save lives; to not put doctors, nurses and other health care workers through the trauma of saying “no” to patients who desperately need help; and critically, for the sake of all of us to prevent a new variant that threatens every Canadian from emerging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680320">Alberta must not be left to deal with this crisis on its own. There is simply too much at stake, and I have to say that Jason Kenney is not alone in his failure of Albertans. The government bears part of the responsibility for this crisis as well. Throughout the pandemic, Jason Kenney has maintained that his policies are designed to protect livelihoods as well as lives, so there has been this focus on our economy, but we know now that countries and provinces that have focused on stopping COVID-19 are the ones that have succeeded in protecting their economies, and that they are integrally tied together. Alberta has failed in both.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680321">We have the worst infection rates and we have had the greatest negative impact on our economy. Over and over again, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has stated that he has our backs and that every Canadian, and I would remind the Prime Minister that “every Canadian” means every Albertan will get the support they need to get through COVID-19. If this was actually true, if we actually were going to give the support that was necessary to Canadians, then premiers like Jason Kenney and Doug Ford could have imposed the strict regulations we needed to stop the spread of COVID and not have had to worry about the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680322">The truth of the matter is that Jason Kenney is not the only one guilty of half-measures. When the government promised us sick leave, they gave us a “sort of” sick leave program. When the government promised income support for workers, they gave us a program that did not work for at least a third of those workers who were impacted. When the government promised programs to help businesses, those programs left out countless small businesses, self-proprietors and the self-employed. When the government promised jobs for students, it designed a program that would not work with an organization that could not deliver, and those jobs were never created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680323">I stood in the House and got unanimous consent that we would protect recent graduates, and the government never followed through on that. When the government promised in the throne speech that it would extend the moratorium on student loan repayments, when it promised support for people living with disabilities, when it asserted that workers threatened by COVID-19 transmission in their place of work could rely on it for support and it would protect workers' rights to refuse unsafe work, every time the government has failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680324">We have not even been able to get the government to move on one of the most basic things we should be looking at right now during a global health pandemic. We have not been able to get the government to move beyond the study of pharmacare. It voted against a pharmacare program in the middle of a global health pandemic. We should be expanding our health care system. We should be making sure we have a pharmacare system now, more than ever, and the government has failed us there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680325">Jason Kenney has been an unmitigated disaster for Alberta, but his terrible job is happening on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s terrible foundation. The federal government needed to do a better job preparing us for this pandemic, ensuring we had paid sick days, implementing a pharmacare program and making sure indigenous communities were better supported. The Prime Minister saw this coming. He has watched this happening in Alberta, and he has done nothing, because he would rather watch Alberta burn than help Jason Kenney. Both the premier and the Prime Minister are playing political games, and Albertans are dying. People in Alberta are dying because of inaction and because of the finger pointing between the federal and provincial governments.</ParaText>

Not one family is saying that they do not want help from either government to save their loved ones. No one is saying that the feds should not act because it is up to the province. They want us, their elected representatives, to throw everything we have so that their loved ones can come home at the end of the day. It is our job to do everything we can to help people survive this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680327">The federal government needs to listen to the NDP, and it needs to do more. We need to help get more vaccines to Alberta, especially to the hot spots that we have identified. We need to get vaccines into the hot zones right now. That needs to happen, and it needs to be a priority. We need to get fixes to paid sick leave so that workers can actually use the program. We need to fix our long-term care systems. We need to make sure that seniors are protected. We need to make sure that we are protecting everybody so that when this is over, and we know that we are facing future pandemics, we will have learned our lessons and be better prepared for the next time around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680328">It seems to me that Jason Kenney and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are putting all their hopes into vaccines and the coming warmer weather, and I understand that. Vaccines are the ultimate answer to come out of COVID-19 and be able to get our families back. However, there is a problem with that. We do not have a guarantee that this will work when, right now in Alberta, there are 1,500, 1,700, 2,000, 4,000, who knows, who are becoming infected right now, today. We simply do not have time to wait. Every second counts in this race, and this is the most important wave that we will deal with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680329">We know that we need to act, and we need to act fast. Alberta needs the federal government to step up to the plate. Alberta and all of Canada needs this government to live up to its obligations and support us through the third wave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680330">Albertans are incredible people. Most Albertans are following COVID-19 protocols. Most Albertans want to solve this crisis, but we need help. We need this government to work directly with indigenous communities in Alberta municipalities to deliver the support they need to get through the third wave. We need money for social services. We need federal support for rapid vaccination programs in the hardest-hit areas. We need this government to live up to the promises that it has made to Albertans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680359">Madam Speaker, first of all, my heart goes out to my colleague. I listened to her speech, and I can hear the fear and worry in her voice for her community, her province and the people there. I share her worry and concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680360">We are at a critical point in the fight against COVID-19, and the third wave is sweeping across many parts of the country. As my colleague pointed out, hospitalizations and ICU admissions are surpassing previous records. Unfortunately, this third wave is, indeed, taking an enormous toll on Albertans. As I have said before, this is an unprecedented situation and we have to respond with unprecedented and swift actions together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680361">The government has been offering Alberta support. We will continue to be there for Alberta and Albertans, of course. We have done this recently, as we have with other provinces that have been facing rising numbers of cases. We work continuously with our provincial counterparts to share expertise and provide support to augment the provinces' capacities to respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680362">My colleague talked about vaccination. As she knows, despite her claims, we have continued to deliver vaccines to the provinces as they scale up and expand vaccination programs. I happen to have the numbers today: 17.2 million vaccines were delivered across the country and nearly 15 million have been put into arms. We are making tremendous progress, but as we vaccinate Canadians, we have to continue to keep each other safe. This virus has shown us time and again that it is sneaky, it is insidious and it can gain on us very quickly if we do not take it seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680363">We have to remain focused on reducing infections, protecting each other and ensuring that people stay safe in their communities. This means that despite how tired we all are, we have to continue to follow public health guidance and do everything in our power, individually and collectively, to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is the finish line, but until we are all safe, we have to keep each other safe. Businesses, governments, families and communities have to do everything in their power to reduce the risks to each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680364">Health Canada has authorized four different COVID-19 vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen. Just today, Health Canada authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children 12 to 15 years of age. All of the authorized vaccines have been shown to be very effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680365">We are making good progress, as I said, distributing these vaccines to the provinces and territories. Over 17 million doses of all authorized COVID-19 vaccines have gone to the provinces and territories, and nearly 15 million Canadians have received their first dose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680366">Earlier this week, we received two million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, the largest shipment from the manufacturer to date, and last month, my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="253382" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation>, announced that Canada has secured COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer for 2022 and 2023, with options to extend into 2024. As we have often said, we will be there for Canadians in this fight against COVID with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes. We expect that COVID-19 vaccines will be available to every eligible Canadian who wants to be vaccinated well before September 2021. This is just part of our commitment to the provinces and territories as we stand together in the fight against COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680367">We continually work with our colleagues to make sure that they have the help they need to manage outbreaks and keep people safe. This includes purchasing and delivering vaccines and PPE, buying and boosting the use of rapid tests, working with the private sector to deploy rapid tests and augmenting contact tracing. Eight dollars of every $10 spent across our country to respond to the pandemic has come from the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680368">Much of the on-the-ground support is being provided through the COVID-19 public health rapid surge capacity initiative. This program, in addition to the safe restart agreements, has provided the provinces and territories with $19 billion in federal investments and additional support for health care system capacity, testing, contact tracing, epidemiological support and other social services to support Canadians. It allows the provinces and territories to respond more effectively to outbreaks and to mitigate transmission in hot zones where there is additional pressure on the health care system. It allows for isolation housing for families and communities that do not have the ability to isolate safely when they become infected or have been in close contact with an infected person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680369">Of course, this support can also be used to strengthen existing services in areas where there is the most need. The eight fields of response under this program include the public health rapid response team; outbreak management; vaccine support; COVID-19 patient testing; laboratory services and equipment; contact tracing; safe voluntary isolation sites; and human resources recruitment. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680370">Recently, we have been able to help struggling health care systems in Ontario, for example, with the health human resource assistance program. This program will provide reimbursement to the provinces and territories that need to use health human resources from another jurisdiction. This will help particularly with respect to staffing intensive care units. The funding helps to ensure that specialized health care services, including ICU nurses, physicians and respiratory therapists, among others, are deployed where and when they are needed. Up to $20 million per province or territory will be available to support their deployment of resources to other jurisdictions in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680371">This is really a team Canada moment. The provinces and territories are stepping up for each other, and the federal government is helping to make sure that financial resources are in place to move the health human resources to where they are needed the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680372">I will speak for a moment about testing and screening, which, along with public health measures, continue to be at the foundation for slowing the spread of COVID-19. So far, more than 25 million rapid tests have been shipped to the provinces and territories, and when combined with the federal allocation, over 41 million rapid tests have been distributed across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680373">The Province of Alberta recently announced that more than 2 million rapid tests will be available for businesses in the province. This follows the successful rollout of more than 1.2 million rapid tests to long-term care facilities, hospitals, homeless shelters and other outbreak sites where we see the virus transmit more easily. These rapid tests have value. They can help identify presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, which allows for earlier isolation and quicker stoppage of the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces and other settings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680374">Another example in Alberta is the Suncor employee screening program. Suncor is one of the first members of the Creative Destruction Lab Rapid Screening Consortium. That is quite the name, but it is an innovation and a private sector workplace initiative that utilizes rapid COVID-19 screening with a commitment to keeping people healthy in the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680375">Suncor's COVID-19 screening program is focused on the hundreds of fly-in, fly-out workers that conduct maintenance in northern Alberta over the spring and summer months. The company is using 100,000 rapid tests, provided through the Alberta government's allotment, and is administering over 300 tests a week. Suncor is also conducting rapid testing for first nations and Métis communities in Fort McKay, including for regional health facility workers and primary caregivers for the elder care centre. The Government of Canada has so far provided Alberta with almost 3 million rapid tests to support initiatives like this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680376">The government continues to work closely with all the provinces and territories, as I said, to ensure that they have the tools they need to respond to the pandemic, including procuring point-of-care PCR and rapid tests, in addition to other public health measures. This is another layer of protection that can help keep workers safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680377">We have also worked really closely with the provincial and territorial governments to strengthen health care and adapt the system to the challenges of delivering health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just last month, I announced the signing of a bilateral agreement with Alberta to support efforts to expand virtual health care services for its residents. We know that virtual health care has been a real boon to community members across this country who are accessing health care from the safety of their own home or from the safety of their own residence. Under this agreement, the province will invest federal funding to accelerate virtual health care services during the pandemic. This bilateral agreement allows Alberta to receive nearly $16 million to expand its efforts on these virtual health care services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680378">Some initiatives Alberta will use the funding for include expanding My Health Record patient portal information and capabilities, and developing a privacy and security framework for virtual care. These initiatives will help the province not only improve access to health care services, but also prioritize the patient experience and keep the privacy and security considerations of health information top of mind, something that we know is important to people accessing virtual care across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680379"> We know that COVID-19 presents a significant physical health risk, but we also know that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on folks with respect to mental health. That is why early on in the pandemic we launched Wellness Together Canada, which is an online portal that offers free mental health and substance-use support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in both official languages with translation into 60 others.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680380">Budget 2021 proposes to provide $100 million over three years to support projects for innovative mental health interventions, because we know that many populations have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including health care workers, frontline workers, youth, seniors, indigenous people, racialized communities and Black Canadians. There are so many incredible community organizations across this country, including in Alberta, that are closest to folks and know how best to deliver those services. We want to support them, especially as we see demand for these kinds of services growing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680381">Thankfully, we continue to see a significant drop in the number of outbreaks in long-term care homes. We are working to ensure that long-term care residents and caregivers are well supported. The fall economic statement invested $6.4 million to the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement. This funding is being used to expand its long-term care program to address pandemic preparedness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680382"> I have to say the foundation has done incredible work on helping long-term care homes across the country become more equipped at infection prevention and control, and other measures to protect their residents. Alberta has 238 of the 350 long-term care homes and retirement homes supported through this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680383">I will close with a few thoughts about the ongoing importance of public health measures. Vaccination campaigns are ramping up, but as we have said before and as we can see, we are not out of the woods yet. Even those who are vaccinated must continue to follow the basic public health measures that are keeping all of us safe. While numbers are growing every day, many people in Canada, in fact most people, are not fully vaccinated yet. Until they are, we need to hold the epidemic at bay with public health measures to provide protection of the population level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680384">Lifting measures too soon will cause an upsurge in cases, and indeed the modelling all along has shown that. The science has not been wrong. If we lift measures too quickly, or apply them too slowly, people will surely get sick and some will die. That is the reality. Despite the frustration, the fatigue that infuses us all, we have to continue and commit to each other to apply public health measures because they do work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680385">International experiences show that stringent public health measures control rapid epidemic growth and allow that time that we need for vaccination rates to grow and to work to reduce the spread. We are at a critical point in the battle against COVID-19. We need to be very careful and protect the progress we have made, even as we look towards a more hopeful future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680386">That means acting on the evidence and continuing to work closely with provinces, territories and municipalities on a coordinated response. It means we need to keep public health measures in place and encourage Canadians to continue to protect themselves by taking the appropriate personal precautions. It means we have to be patient, and we have to hold on just a little more before we relax our guard. It means that we need to hold on together, governments at all levels, businesses and people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680387"> We cannot ignore this virus. COVID is not partisan. It does not care about our divisions. In fact, it actually exploits them. It exploits communities and countries that do not work together. It is why our federal government has been there for provinces, people, workers and businesses. Every step of the way, we have been there for Canadians. We will continue to be there for Albertans every step of the way. We will be there with resources, people, vaccines and equipment, testing, and financial supports for families, as they work so hard to protect each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680388">The Government of Canada will continue to support provinces and territories as we finish this fight. I spoke with Minister Shandro last week. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has spoken with Premier Kenney last night. We both reiterated our ongoing offers of support for Alberta and Albertans during this tough time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680389">I know Albertans are working hard together, and I encourage every Canadian, every Albertan to accept vaccination when it is their turn. Vaccines do save lives, and they stop the spread. It is the biggest gift of health that we can give ourselves and our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680390">We can see the finish line. We need all to take actions together that will defeat this virus from infecting new people. We have come a long way over the past year. We have learned a lot of hard lessons. Now our challenge is to stay the course. The Government of Canada is committed to doing that, and I know that Canadians share that determination. We will continue to support each other until we have overcome this third wave of the pandemic and have emerged even stronger on the other side.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680395">I am extremely encouraged by the rate at which we are vaccinating in this country. As the member opposite knows, we are now second or third in the G20, depending on the day, as vaccinations continue to be administered in all the provinces and territories. The provinces and territories are doing a phenomenal job with all kinds of innovation to get at vaccinating populations in hot spots, at workplaces, through pharmacies and in other venues. We have to continue to protect each other collaboratively and collectively while we get the job done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680404">Mr. Speaker, again, my heart goes out to the member opposite, and I thank her for this emergency debate. I did speak to the mayor of Wood Buffalo last week as well, and we spoke about the intersection of small communities, work camps and indigenous communities. I am from Northern Ontario, and although it is a different industry, it has very similar dynamics. We talked about the role of vaccination, the role of rapid testing and, indeed, the role of isolation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680405">I think rapid testing cannot be done in isolation. It is a tool, an extra layer of protection. It allows for people to understand very quickly if there are infections in a workplace, but then the next steps are equally important. The mayor talked extensively about the supports that need to be in place to help people when they are, in fact, positive with COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680406">We also talked about targeted vaccination. This is something that is completely in the province's control. The province has the ability to target vaccines and hot spots. In fact, that is exactly what Ontario has done, at the community level and at the provincial level. It has been able to move vaccines around as a way to help bring down some of the case growth in very precarious settings or precarious regions of the province. We will be there to continue to support those conversations for the Province of Alberta.</ParaText>

What I would like everybody listening to this speech tonight to understand is that Alberta was in a very bad spot prior to the pandemic. We were in a severe economic downturn, and that really exacerbated part of the problem that we have faced here over the last year and a half. I would argue that in a lot of ways it has been worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680421">I know that there has been a lot of conversation, and I have watched the media narrative play out over the last 72 hours, with comments like “Why are restrictions not working in Alberta like they are in other places?” with the implications that Albertans are not following the rules. Here is the reality from Calgary: People need to eat. Therefore, it is very paternalistic to say just that people who might not be following restrictions are doing so from a place of bourgeois contempt for the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680422"> There are so many people in my province, I would argue most people in my province, who want to do everything possible to abide by public health rules, and they are doing their best, but they are also really struggling. There are a lot of people in my community who do not have the luxury of being able to stay at home and work from home and self-isolate or wait for the disastrously termed “preferred vaccine”. That is just not the reality. Lockdown is a luxury for a lot of people in my community. That is the reality for gig economy workers, taxi drivers, people who were in the resource industry; they are the Alberta economy. We do look different economically than other parts of the country do, so yes, measures are going to affect how people respond differently. That is a reality that I just do not feel has been adequately acknowledged by policy-makers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680423">We need to start there. We need to start understanding that a year and a half into this, people want to do everything they can to observe these measures, but they also feel like there has to be an end in sight; they need to work—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680432">Mr. Speaker, it really sort of stinks to be interrupted in the middle of that, because that is the key message here: My community cannot afford lockdown. Everybody wants to do their part, everybody wants to stop the spread of COVID, everybody understands how serious it is, but we need a durable solution, which has not been delivered to us, and the federal government has a major role in that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680433">What does the federal government need to do from a solutions perspective? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680434">First, the government needs a stable supply of vaccines. The provincial government, every provincial government in the country, has seen supplies, like Lucy and the football from the Charlie Brown cartoon series, where vaccines are coming, but then they are not. We have not had a single dose of AstraZeneca delivered from the actual contract with the manufacturer. It has only been raided from COVAX, or charity from the Americans, or from the Serum Institute of India. We need to provide more details to the provinces about the future of vaccine rollouts. There needs to be stability. Again, every week, the numbers seem to change, and that is not going to provide a durable solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680435">Having the public be able to look at the details of contracts so that Parliament can understand whether or not the government is doing its job in holding manufacturers to account on recourse could have been part of it as well. However, the federal government has not been transparent on that, and Parliament has not been able to do its job because of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680436">I implore the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>, and I know she may not like me, but she needs to talk to Health Canada, PHAC and NACI and get their act together on the confusing messaging that is coming out on vaccine efficacy and safety. It is her job. She needs to pull those people in together, knock their heads together a little bit and say, “What happened this week can never happen again.” It has happened numerous times now, and she needs to take a leadership role so that Canadians can have trust in public health institutions, and so that the debacle that happened this week does not happen again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680437">The government also needs to come up with some better use or national strategy for rapid testing. I think the federal government has really kind of wiped its hands of that. It could be providing advice and support for advice on that, but that has not happened. Even things like using rapid tests in airports for domestic travel are something that the government has not looked into. There could be more approval of over-the-counter rapid tests or home-purchased rapid tests. We have not seen that happen. Again, I understand that the regulator has to do due diligence on that, but certainly we can have diligence and a good review process to give more tools to people to stop the spread. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680438">We could remove the hotel quarantine policy. It has been such an unmitigated disaster. We are hearing reports of COVID spreading in these facilities. I mean, I could litigate all the failures around the border, but how do we move forward from this, given the failures? There will be a time for inquiry, but moving forward the government could immediately cut down on the list of those who are exempted from quarantine until more vaccines can be deployed. It could limit those who are exempted to a very small number of critical workers, like truck drivers, and prioritize access to vaccines for those persons. It could put in place measures to ensure that every person entering Canada is required to be tested upon arrival, including at land and sea borders, with exemptions only for critical workers who are fully vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680439">The government could develop a clear set of parameters for identifying risks presented by emerging variants and present this to the public in an easy-to-understand format. I do not understand why we do not have a Defcon level ranking system for when variants are emerging, and why that is not being communicated to the public in terms of travel or even around essential travel. It is like, “The risk is low, but it is not.” The confusing messaging that the Auditor General rightly criticized the Public Health Agency of Canada for issuing at the front end of the pandemic could be fixed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680440">Also, we could provide a data-driven plan to provinces and Canadians on how and when lockdown measures will be lifted. The federal government still has not provided any benchmarking for what fully vaccinated persons could do. If we start telling the public what fully vaccinated persons can do, there will be more uptake of vaccines. For those who are having mental health challenges, there will be some hope in knowing that, “Okay, when I get both of my doses, I can do this.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680441">However, we know that is not coming forward, I would surmise, because the federal government does not have a line of sight on when everybody will be fully vaccinated, because of the shortage and because of concerns about what the dosing delay is going to mean for long-term efficacy. That needs to be solved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680442">I cannot stress enough how critical this is for the people in my community in Alberta, who have long-sufferingly provided support to the rest of the country through hundreds of billions of dollars in payments to the federal government and have not received a lot in return. We get forgotten by the federal government all the time. In these instances, at these times, casting aspersions or finger pointing or playing politics between the NDP and the provincial government is not going to cut it. What we need is a plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680443">I wish I had three hours to talk about all the things that we could be doing right now that the federal government and the provincial government are not, but I do not. Suffice it to say, there are things that could be done that we are not doing, and I implore the federal government, I implore the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> to put these things aside and start understanding that everything is not fine. It is not okay. We are not in a position of success federally in this country, and more must be done. That is why I needle the government every day. That is why I prep for committee, and that is why I hold the government to account, because we can and must do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680444">Instead of casting aspersions that somehow Alberta is to blame, that the spread that is happening is the fault of the people of my province, legislators and leaders in this country need to start standing up and doing their job: being stricter on the border, doing better on vaccines, having better data, supporting people more effectively and giving them hope for when this is going to be over. I cannot say enough how hard it is to be in one of the hardest-hit communities in the country right now. It breaks my heart. It is the place from which I get up in the House of Commons every day and ask questions and demand better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680445">I implore the federal government to do this on behalf of every single Albertan who is listening to this tonight. We need more vaccines. We need a clear line of sight. We need clear communications, and we need the federal government to stop patronizing us in its response. When we are holding it to account and demanding better, that is its job, and hopefully there will be a solution for Albertans because of the work of everybody in Parliament who is doing their job here tonight.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680449">Mr. Speaker, lockdown is a blunt tool used to stop the spread of the virus. By now, there are better tools, more durable solutions, that should have been deployed across this country. Lockdowns are a very bourgeois concept for a lot of legislators. For the frontline grocery store worker or the mom who shares custody and is working three jobs to make ends meet, who cannot do her job sitting at a desk and having Uber Eats deliver to her, lockdown is paternalistic. It is unaffordable, even with CERB or whatever. It is a luxury. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680450">Being able to stay at home and protect themselves from the virus by isolation is a luxury most workers in Canada cannot afford. That is what I am talking about: understanding that this is a year and a half in and we need a more durable solution that keeps people safe, that stops the spread of COVID, but also understands and highlights the inequities of lockdown that have been exacerbated. Lockdown is classist. We need more vaccines. We need more equity in this country, and the only way we are going to do that is to start saying the obvious: that not everybody can afford to sit at home indefinitely.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6680458">Mr. Speaker, I find it ironic that I was standing in the House only a couple of weeks ago in another emergency debate on the COVID-19 pandemic. I believe I started off my speech that night saying that I had been here in February in an emergency debate on COVID-19. I certainly hoped that I would not have to be here for a third emergency debate on COVID-19. I was hoping that the government would get its act together and start getting vaccines to provinces for them to distribute, to get Canadians vaccinated and get immunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680459">However, here I am, less than two weeks later and we are in a third emergency debate on the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been a very difficult two weeks, certainly this past week, when we are seeing once again very mixed messages from the Liberal government in terms of efficacy and immunity when it comes to certain vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680460">Today's debate is specifically about Alberta. I want to take this opportunity to talk about what could have been. We had opportunities to have made-in-Alberta solutions to address the COVID pandemic. I want to start with the Alberta pilot project at the airports and land borders. Almost a full year ago, Alberta took it upon itself to initiate a pilot program where travellers would be given a rapid test before they started their travels, either on flights at the Calgary International Airport or at the Sweetgrass Coutts Border Crossing, and were given a rapid test again when they returned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680461">I want to give some numbers for non-exempt travel participants, or non-essential travellers. During the pilot project timeline in Alberta, 50,929 travellers were tested using the Alberta pilot program rapid test. Of those test results, on the first test at the point of entry, 1.37% of travellers tested positive for COVID. On their second test, 0.7% of travellers tested positive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680462">The total travellers who tested positive was just over 1%. Of the almost 51,000 travellers tested via the Alberta pilot program rapid test, 1% were positive. Let us put that in perspective. That program was extremely successful at identifying the small number of travellers who had COVID. They were forced to do a 14-day quarantine at home while the rest were able to go about their daily lives. Instead of taking that program, which was successful, and moving it to every other international airport in the country, the Liberal response was to shut that program down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680463">We had a successful program that was identifying positive COVID results of travellers arriving in Calgary and in Alberta through the land crossing, and the Liberals cancelled it. Instead of taking that program and using that template in other international airports across Canada, the Liberals invoked the hotel quarantine program at a cost of $250 million, not to mention the stress and anxiety that it put on travellers coming back into Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680464">I want to be really clear that these were not just snowbirds coming home or people coming back from sunny locales. These were people who were travelling internationally for funerals, medical appointments and cancer treatments. I have had many of these conversations with my own constituents who were in tears trying to figure out how they could get home, and spending hours on hold trying to book a quarantine hotel with little success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680465">The Liberals took a program that was working, which put minimal stress and anxiety on travellers and certainly did not cost $250 million, and they scrapped it in favour of a disastrous hotel quarantine program. We know it is even worse now. We are seeing outbreaks in hotel quarantine sites. Sexual assaults have happened in these hotel quarantine sites. It has been a complete and utter disaster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680466">Instead of scrapping that program and going back to the pilot program, which we knew worked, the results were almost exactly the same. This is the most frustrating thing. The hotel quarantine identified about 1% of the travellers. It is not like it was identifying an exorbitantly different number. It did not work. It does not work. Alberta had a made-in-Alberta solution that could have been copied across Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680467">I also want to talk about an opportunity to address the vaccines. I have spoken about this in the House a couple of times. Providence Therapeutics in Calgary started approaching the government a year ago with the same innovation and technology that other mRNA vaccines were using, such as Moderna and Pfizer, and it could have been produced here in Canada. Now we have the CEO of Providence saying that he is sick and tired of banging his head against the wall trying to get support from the Liberal government. He is now looking to go abroad, either to the United States or the European Union. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680468">I asked this in question period the other day. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said there was a $100 million program, and Providence got $10 million from it. Let us put that in perspective in comparison to Moderna in the United States. Through Operation Warp Speed, Moderna has been given $2.4 billion by the United States government. In comparison, when we had the possibility with Providence Therapeutics of a made-in-Alberta, but more importantly a made-in-Canada vaccine solution, which could have been developed and manufactured here in Canada and for which we would not have to rely on unreliable global supply chains, the company was given $10 million by the Liberal government. That is 0.4% of what was given to a comparable company in the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680469">To compare that again, the Liberals were willing to spend $250 million on a hotel quarantine program that does not even work, but they could have supported a Canadian innovator, a Canadian company, to manufacture and develop vaccines right here in Canada. Instead, Providence has been invited by other countries to go to the United States or the EU to develop and manufacture that program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680470">That is not the first time. Solstar Pharma was in a very similar position. It is based out of Laval, Quebec, but has investors in Calgary. It has been funded by Operation Warp Speed in the United States and its product is being developed in San Diego. That is another one that could have been done here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680471">Is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> so focused on ignoring Alberta that the Liberals would ignore a made-in-Canada solution just because Providence Therapeutics is based there? I would hope that is not the case. Certainly, that is how those of us who are members of Parliament from Alberta feel. We feel that Alberta has done its part when it comes to trying to address or offer solutions to the pandemic, and we are being ignored. I can certainly understand. I hope members would see how frustrating it is, not only for the elected officials representing Alberta ridings but certainly for our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680472">Probably the biggest frustration that we have as Canadians, and certainly as Albertans as well, is the mixed messages we are getting from the federal government. The other day, my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> asked the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> about Canadians who were getting certain vaccines and were not sure about their second ones. I want to add a personal perspective to this. My wife has had her first AstraZeneca vaccine dose. Now she has no idea when she is going to get her second, because AstraZeneca vaccines have been delayed. She wants to know how long her immunity is going to last or if she is going to have to take one or two doses of a Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine because she is not going to get her second AstraZeneca dose. The minister did not feel it was worth answering real questions from real Canadians who have real concerns. My wife wants an answer to the question of whether she will have to take the AstraZeneca or have to take two doses of another vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680473">That is the frustration that Canadians are feeling from these mixed messages and the inability to access vaccines. Fewer than 3% of Canadians have had their second dose of a vaccine. I am getting calls, as I know almost all of my colleagues here are, from frustrated, depressed, stressed business owners, moms, dads and grandparents. We want an end to this. We want Canadian businesses back open. We want Canadians back to work. I want to be able to hug my loved ones, whom I have not seen in more than a year. We need a clear path to how this is going to be resolved, and we need to see that sooner, not later.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680479">Mr. Speaker, I am here in B.C. and I live in the Vancouver Island Health Authority, which has been broken into sections and we are not supposed to leave those sections unless it is an absolute emergency because we care about public health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680480">When I look at the reality across this country, where we see public gatherings, we see things happening that we do not want to see. Misinformation about lockdowns and restrictions has caused a great deal of confusion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6680490">Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the charming member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. It is a pleasure for me to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680491">First, I would like to say that I completely understand the heartfelt concern of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252961" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation>. I was listening to her earlier, and I understand her concerns because we experienced something similar in Quebec during the first wave, when the situation in our long-term care facilities was very troubling, very worrisome. Today, we see that there are 23,600 active cases in Alberta compared to 8,800 cases in Quebec. Demographically speaking, we see that the situation is very worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680492">As legislators, what should we do in a growing pandemic? This situation is not good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680493">I would say that the first thing to do is not to give in to the instinct we have as politicians. It is unfortunate, but often as politicians, our instinct is to look for a scapegoat. I am saying that because we often get into the habit of pointing the finger rather than looking for solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680494">I would like to say that I have a great deal of sympathy for Albertans and for what they are going through. I may have a little less for Jason Kenney. Perhaps his handling of the crisis was not totally perfect, but that is not for us to say. It is not the House of Commons' job to judge Jason Kenney; that is the Legislative Assembly of Alberta's job. It is the opposition parties' job to do that and to show that there were perhaps some serious flaws in the way he managed the crisis. To sum up, it is not our job to put Jason Kenney on trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680495">Although I say that, I am also aware that the preferred attitude during a crisis is, in my opinion, a responsible one. I think that responsibility dictates that we listen to science. We have an obligation to listen to science, especially in a pandemic. Perhaps that is not what Mr. Kenney did. He will have to answer to his fellow Albertans. However, science tells us that lockdowns can be useful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680496">Earlier, I heard my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> say that the lockdown was an issue in her riding, that it was unfair, that not everyone was being treated the same during lockdowns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680497">I do not know if this is the case in Alberta, but I can say that during the lockdown in Quebec, grocery stores and essential services remained open. We debated that at length in the House of Commons. There were benefits for people losing their jobs. There is a social safety net that lets us keep a roof over our heads and food on the table during a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680498">I find it most unfortunate to let our constituents believe that there is a magic solution that does not require lockdowns. What science is telling us and what public health is telling us is that this dreaded lockdown is necessary. In Quebec, it is very well managed by public health authorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680499">At this time, we know that the situation is alarming. There is one thing that will surely make an appearance again and that is the Emergencies Act. Ontario invoked the Emergencies Act to get help from the federal government. Quebec did the same thing for its long-term care facilities and the army came to give us a hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680500">Personally, I can see how this would be a useful tool, but it up to the provinces to use it. It is not up to the federal government, which does not have jurisdiction or expertise in health matters, to tell the provinces how to manage the pandemic. If the Emergencies Act were to be invoked, it would have to be in response to a formal request from the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The federal government has no business taking that power away from the legitimately elected members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. I think that, if the government wants to do something useful in terms of pandemic response, the best thing it can do is make sure we have a more robust health care system going forward. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680501">In Quebec, I think most health care providers realized that there were weaknesses in our health care system. Where do those weaknesses come from?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680502">I have to say that for the past 20 years there has been a systemic problem in the Canadian federation, and that is the fiscal imbalance. It is not normal that the level of government with the greatest financial capacity provides just slightly more than 20% of every dollar invested in the health sector and that the provinces are forced—at least that is the case in Quebec—year after year to deal with difficult budget situations because the government's contribution to health care funding is inadequate. In the next few years we may have to face a similar crisis. If we do not have a more robust health care system at that point, then we will not have learned from our mistakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680503">If the government wants to be helpful, the best thing it can do is listen to the provinces, like Quebec and Alberta, which have been calling for health transfers of 35% for far too long. That way the pressure and problems that Alberta is currently experiencing with intensive care might be problems that could be dealt with much more easily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680504">What Alberta is currently going through is similar to the problems experienced in long-term care centres and seniors homes in Quebec. Part of the problem was the burnout being felt by health care staff, who have been overwhelmed for years now. Fewer employees are being hired and more work is being done in mandatory overtime to reduce the financial strain on the system. In the end, it became quite clear that our system is very ill-equipped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680505">In my view, the best response the federal government could give today would be to better fund the provincial health care systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680506">I ask all my colleagues not to give in to the political instinct we all have, as I said earlier, to want to score points by finding a scapegoat for the current crisis. Instead, we must try to respect each other's jurisdictions and ensure that rational political action is taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680507">I will close by saying that I encourage everyone to listen to science-based recommendations. We need to follow public health rules and know that this imposes certain limitations on us both in terms of vaccination and lockdown. If every politician would follow the rules and encourage their constituents to do the same, I think that would be a very good start.</ParaText>

I am prepared to agree, but it did not make the effort that it should have to ensure that the health care system is adequately funded. It is totally unacceptable that barely 20% of every dollar invested in health, one of the most important budget items, comes from the federal government. In Quebec, if I recall correctly, more than 48% of the government's entire budget goes to health care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680522">Mr. Speaker, my thanks to my hon. colleague from Jonquière for splitting his time with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680523">We are in a terrible place now. When we were first getting used to the idea that we were in a pandemic and needed to adjourn Parliament on March 13, 2020, some of us stood in this place to say that by unanimous consent we were going to adjourn until April 20, 2020. It seems absurd now. I clearly remember saying that the Greens had given their unanimous consent, while wondering if we really needed to stay out as long as April 20. It seemed maybe a little extreme, but we would see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680524"> We have learned a lot. We started talking about flattening the curve. We thought that would be adequate, because we were told it would be, but we have learned more. This has been a very steep learning curve. We could have learned faster, gone faster, and followed the models of countries like New Zealand, Australia and South Korea, the countries that decided to go hard and fast, using the kind of advice that the World Health Organization, Dr. Michael Ryan, recommended back then of, “Go hard, go fast. Don't wait to be perfect. Speed trumps perfection.” I thought we were going fast and I certainly am not at the level of someone who wants to start casting blame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680525">I find this debate tonight difficult because, as much as there is blame to be cast, does it help? I do not want the people of Alberta to feel that the federal Parliament has decided to lay into them with clubs. It is pretty clear that their premier miscalculated badly and cost people's lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680526"> I want to reflect a bit on something that I do not think gets said enough in this place. I think there is a perception in Alberta that people like me, who want to see the fossil fuel industry shut down, phased out over time and take care of the workers that that somehow means we do not love Alberta. I really love Alberta and I love Albertans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680527">I have so much respect for the grit of Alberta in facing major disasters. I remember very clearly, of course, the 2013 floods in Calgary. I went. I pulled rotted debris from people's basements in High River because I found myself in the days after the 2013 flood in Calgary for the stampede and just thought I could be more useful if I got a friend and we went up to High River to see if we could help. I have the t-shirt that says, “Come Hell or High Water”. Mayor Nenshi decided that even though it looked impossible to have the stampede, they were going to have it. I admire that spirit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680528">Soon thereafter, during the 2016 fires at Fort McMurray, there was incredible community spirit with no one left behind. There was a very strong image of a patient, orderly evacuation with fires on all sides, and the residents of Fort McMurray moving out along the single road. If somebody's car ran out of gas, they got into somebody else's car. It was inspiring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680529">For Alberta to be the site of the highest COVID rates in North America is devastatingly frightening, because we know more about this pandemic now. We know about this virus. We know the longer the virus lives among us, the more likely we are in a human petri dish to have more dangerous variants. We do not know yet if it is all about getting vaccines in case a variant overcomes a vaccine. We are in a very dangerous place during this third wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680530">Today we are marking Red Dress Day, to think about and to pledge solidarity with all of the families of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. It was early June, two years ago, that the government had delivered unto it the report of the inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and two-spirited peoples. One of the inquiry's key recommendations was to shut down the “man camps”. At that point, the threat to human life was from what were called the “man camps” in the inquiry. Many Canadians may not know the term, but it meant that large construction sites represent a threat to the vulnerable, to the marginalized who have to hitchhike.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680531">I know there was a very strong reaction from people in Alberta, and of course most of the workers are the dads, the grandads, the brothers, the sons and thoroughly decent people, but there is no question but that the evidence shows that missing and murdered indigenous women and girls are at more risk when there are transient camps of workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680532">In COVID, I just want to ask why it is that we, public health officials and governments, decided that when other things had to close down, like mom-and-pop shops and various places where people might have been able to be better off than in a concentrated place like a work camp, the work camps were so essential that we could not shut them down. The highest rates of COVID in Alberta right now are in the region of the oil sands. They have very high rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680533">In British Columbia the NDP Government of British Columbia has decided Site C is so important to continue, that we would not possibly think of shutting it down when it has outbreaks. We have outbreaks right now at the Site C dam site, the Kitimat LNG facilities that are being built, along the Trans Mountain pipeline construction link, the Coastal GasLink. All the man camps turn out to also be places where COVID flourishes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680534">One of the key things about the oil sands is that the workers commute by airplane. Members can think of poor Newfoundland and Labrador, where they were in the Atlantic bubble and felt that the rates were low enough to meet the requirement under Newfoundland and Labrador law that new Premier Andrew Furey had to call an election within a few months. Suddenly, they had an outbreak of COVID from the oil sands workers, and they are having them now. If we search this we will find it everywhere that academics and scientists are saying they have a problem with these fly-in, fly-out camps. One expert said that COVID did not just walk in there by itself, it showed up on an airplane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680535">While we worry about international borders and why we are not being tighter with our borders, how is it that we are so addicted to oil that we turn a blind eye to the impact of these man camps that we should have been shutting down, or at least ensuring that the work force there was not commuting across many provincial borders? There were ways, perhaps, to keep people in the construction industry working when many other industries were shut down, but we have turned a blind eye to the fact of these squashed, busy workplaces like slaughterhouses. We have shut down parts of our economy, but turned a blind eye to the places that seem to me, in reviewing the evidence, to be the places where COVID flourishes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680536">We have seen the mayor of Lethbridge, Chris Spearman, say, “We have done the least of the provinces. We’ve tolerated protests against masks and at the hospital and rapid vaccination clinic.” We need to do more. One of the Albertans I admire the most, because he is brilliant, is journalist, Andrew Nikiforuk, who wrote a piece just a few days ago in The Tyee entitled “A Coronavirus Hell of Kenney’s Own Making”. I only mention the title so members can look it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680537">He said the “numbers reflect, first and foremost, Premier Jason Kenney’s callous and persistent disregard for scientific findings and mathematical reality.” One of those mathematical realities is exponential growth. Alberta is in a dangerous place right now, and it is certainly not the fault of Albertans. We had a government in Alberta that, over Christmas, had a fairly significant portion of its elected provincial leadership decide it was okay to go on a vacation. As I dug into it, I found one of the ministers excused herself by saying she wanted to make sure she was helping the airlines in this economic crisis. I thought it was a facetious comment that would not land well, but then I read further and found that the premier had thought it was a good way to help WestJet and that there would be a kind of safety on an Alberta-to-Hawaii corridor that could somehow live outside the reality of COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680538">There were problems in leadership. There were problems of not leading by example. There were problems in not wanting to address the science of COVID by allowing the policies to be ideological. None of us can let this be ideological. We have to set aside whatever partisanship we bring to this and end up where Andrew Nikiforuk's article ended, which was, “It's time to pray for Alberta,” and I will also note that faith by itself does not do the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680539">We need to do the work to help Alberta and Albertans in any way we can.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680540">Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my voice to those who are thinking of Alberta during the most recent outbreaks. I spent five years of my life there, and in 2013, when I was personally evacuated, I saw first-hand what a good neighbour looks like. There was hardly a person I knew who was not picking up scrap from their neighbour's yard and making sure they had groceries and were taken care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680541">However, during this debate, I sit here stunned. Living in Nova Scotia, I sometimes hear people say, “Where you stand depends on where you sit.” We have had the benefit of a thoughtful pandemic response from a public health point of view. We are in a lockdown now, after seeing our cases go into double digits and now triple digits for a few days. The collective response has been one of acceptance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680542"> We know that the option is not between a lockdown and not a lockdown. The option is between having a short and serious lockdown or a lengthy and drawn out lockdown. Those who have studied pandemic responses around the world, as seen during COVID-19, have found that the jurisdictions that have embraced a strict and swift lockdown have seen a lesser impact on their economy and their public's health, and fewer restrictions on their civil liberties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680543">I am curious if the member could offer commentary on the importance of following the epidemiological research and science to understand that we need to be neighbourly once again and need to support Albertans with financial supports, federally and provincially, to ensure that they can afford to do the right thing and stay home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680545">I am astonished that in this country we do not learn, even within the boundaries of Canada, what is working and what is not. The Atlantic bubble was an extraordinary success of, as the hon. member said, evidence-based decision-making and strong instructions for people to stay home. They were able to create an Atlantic bubble so that New Brunswickers could drive to P.E.I. and Prince Edward Islanders could get to Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680546">The case rates in the Atlantic bubble, compared with those in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and now Alberta, show a real success story.

              <ParaText id="6680548">I want to look at some preliminary figures published by the Office for National Statistics in the U.K. On January 19, there were 1,372 COVID deaths. By the week of April 16, the average death rate was 29. Compare this with the average rate of 80 for the flu between 2015 and 2019. What happened between January and April? The government unveiled a very successful vaccination strategy. That has clearly not been the case in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680549">Could the hon. member speak to that?

              <ParaText id="6680550">Mr. Speaker, the U.K. initially made a lot of mistakes. Up to the point when Prime Minister Boris Johnson came down with COVID, they had not been moving as quickly and as hard as they have done recently, which is why they have been able to deal with variants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680551"> The variants in particular are quite terrifying. I have lots of criticism to go around on all sides. I even hate the partisanship of focusing on only one province right now. However, I think our bigger problem is the fractured federation and not being clear on how we can work together. We are not even using the Emergencies Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680552">As I have said to my hon. colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252830" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation>, I do not intend not to criticize the federal government, as mistakes have been made everywhere. However, the more we can approach this in a non-partisan fashion, the more chance we have of being team Canada and getting through this with minimal loss of life now that we are in a third wave that is quite terrifying.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6680553">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak this evening to this very important issue. If we track it to its very beginning, we will find that at that point, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada made it very clear to all Canadians, including members of Parliament, that the first priority of the Government of Canada was to take a team Canada approach in combatting the coronavirus. That has happened, and there are ample examples of how we have managed it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680554">I was born and raised in the Prairies. In fact, Alberta is where I served my time in the Canadian Forces. I was posted in Edmonton at Lancaster Park, and I spent a few very good years of my life there. I also have family members who live in Alberta, particularly in the Lethbridge area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680555"> My heart goes out to the province of Alberta, as it does to the province of Ontario. When a province is getting into an area of concern, it starts to put so much stress on our institutions, particularly our health care institutions, and one cannot help but wonder what the impact of that will be on the health conditions of citizens in the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680556">We need to put the COVID-19 virus into the perspective of our federation. Canada is very different from the U.K. We have jurisdictional control here in Ottawa for certain things, and the provinces have jurisdictional control over other areas. However, all in all, as a federation, we have done quite well, and there is no exception here. Yes, there have been some concerns, but it is important that Ottawa continues to work closely with the provinces and territories, which we have seen from day one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680557">When it comes to the province of Alberta and its recent third wave, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have been talking with Premier Kenney. As I understand, it happened just the other day. The Government of Canada is very much aware of what is taking place in Alberta, and we are concerned about it. I do not think that will come as a surprise to the people who are following the debate this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680558">When we look at where we came from and where we are today, I am glad to say that so much more hope is there. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Vaccines will play an absolutely critical role in the post-pandemic recovery, as we all know, and we have seen significant gains in that area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680559">I have been listening closely to members providing their thoughts on the federal government and the role we have played. I take a great deal of exception to comments by the Conservatives, given the degree to which they continue to want to politicize, give false information and give the opinion that Ottawa cares less for Alberta than it does for the rest of the country. What absolute and total garbage. Shame on each and every member of Parliament who tries to give that impression. The Conservative Party has spread misinformation, and I question some of the statements that have been made this evening. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680560">We have been going through this for 14 months, and the former leader of the Green Party talked about flattening the curve. It has been a very steep learning curve for all of us. It is not like we had a foundation of knowledge around the world that we could draw upon to make instant decisions. The Conservatives believe they could have, as though they can just pull them out of a hat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680561">This government believes in evidence-based decision-making, so we put together the committees and advisory groups that were absolutely essential. We continue to follow the advice of health experts and science, knowing full well that it is our best way out of this situation, and we are not alone. The provinces and territories equally bring together health experts, look at science and make decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680562">My concern in part is that we should be trying to send a consistent message from Ottawa. We should not be telling communities that they cannot have a lockdown. That is not a positive message. It is confusing. That comes from the Conservative opposition health critic. She makes it very clear that she does not support lockdowns. Think of the costs of not taking some of these actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680563">We have consistently recognized that at times there is a need for change. I made reference to the flattening of the curve. That was an educational experience for all Canadians. When COVID-19 first came out, we all learned that we had to keep the numbers down during the first wave. That meant having to wash our hands, use some sort of sanitizer and physically distance. Members will recall that at the very beginning, the health experts were not saying we had to wear a mask. It was not until we were a few weeks into the pandemic that they started saying we should be wearing masks. Then all of us, at least I would hope all of us, were conveying to our constituents the very simple but important message to wash our hands, wear a mask and maintain physical distancing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680564">The provinces, Ottawa, indigenous leaders and territories, working with a team Canada approach, recognized that we needed to shut down certain aspects of our economy to protect the interests of Canadians and their health and safety. The federal government therefore developed programs for all Canadians, whether in Alberta, Ontario or my home province of Manitoba. These programs saw literally billions of dollars going into the pockets of Canadians to ensure that they would be able to continue making the payments that are necessary. Even if they cannot work, the bills continue to come in. They still have a requirement to buy groceries and pay rent or a mortgage. The government, through different programs, made a very clear indication to Canadians at the very beginning that we would have their backs, and we have done just that in every way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680565">As we have seen, the provinces, at different times and in different ways, have had different impacts, in good part because of the decisions that were being made. As a federation, we recognize that there is jurisdictional control and that the provinces lead in certain areas. One of those areas was deciding what would be closed down and if there was a need for a full lockdown.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="00">(2100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680566">Some provinces did exceptionally well, others maybe not as well. Many different factors need to be taken into consideration. At the end of the day, Ottawa and in particular the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have maintained communication with premiers and first ministers through the numerous meetings that have taken place. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and other ministers have maintained communications with provinces, territories and indigenous leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680567">We ensured there was a high sense of co-operation and that there were no surprises. People who might be following the debate should be made aware of this. We understand that Canadians want us to be working together and we have been working together in that team Canada approach, even though it has not been universal on the floor of the House of Commons. At the beginning it was, but I now find more and more misleading information coming from the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680568"> There are areas that cause a great deal of concern. If we listen to the Conservative members, they will say that it is all Ottawa's fault. They are more concerned about placing blame. They said that if Ottawa would have only had 50 million vaccine doses back in January, we would not have the third wave or any other wave. It is all Ottawa. The Conservatives say that if the Conservative Party of Canada were in government, it would have had manufacturing at full capacity back in August of last year and no doubt approved a vaccine back in June of last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680569">Of course, the vaccines and the acquisition of them was of critical importance. The government recognized that early last year. Where was that concern with respect to vaccines back in June and July? The Conservatives asked hundreds, if not thousands, of questions. I cannot recall one question from the Conservative Party in June or July about the vaccine. If I am wrong, and many of them were there, they can give me the date. That is the nice thing about Hansard. They can show me that I am wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680570">As a country, we are doing exceptionally well. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made assurances to premiers and anyone else who wanted to get information that because of the contracts we were able to negotiate through our <Affiliation DbId="253382" Type="4">procurement minister</Affiliation> and procurement staff, we had a commitment of six million vaccine doses by the end of the first quarter. We were saying that for months, like back in December when the first vaccine was approved last year. Not only did we meet that target, we exceeded it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680571">Now, because of the agreements we achieved with companies like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, we are now in a position where we are the third best out of the G20 countries in terms of people getting their first dose. Well over 30% of people in Canada now have that first dose. We understand the importance of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680572">The Conservatives will fall back and say that we are only at 2% on the double dose, that the Liberals are bad and so forth. We should listen to the evidence-based decision-making. Are the Conservatives suggesting that everyone should be getting the second dose now? What would that first dose percentage be? I am inclined to agree with what our health care experts at the national level and provincial level say.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="05">(2105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680573">We are on the right track and the numbers are clear on that. Issues in the months of January and February did throw us off course to a certain degree, but they were not necessarily under our control. When Pfizer said that it had to retool, so it had to cut back for a couple of weeks on its numbers, it was not like we were in a position to say no. We had a contract that said we would get a commitment from Pfizer. We will be receiving over two million doses of vaccine a week come June, and I understand we will receive two million doses this week. The numbers are very impressive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680574">The provinces are aware of it. They know the number of doses coming into Canada. In fact, when we talk about transparency and accountability, any Canadian can click on the Government of Canada's coronavirus website and get the hard number of vaccines that are in the country. It will say which province has what number of vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680575">In comparison, we are doing well. Canada has a population of 37.5 million people. We have close to 17 million doses in Canada. Before the end of June, we will be somewhere around 48 million doses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680576">We can look at what is happening in Alberta today. We only need to read some of the headlines, such as “Alberta tightens restrictions, increases fines for COVID-19 rule-breakers.” That is from a CBC report. It lists a number of areas where it is now tightening things in hopes of minimizing the damage of that third wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680577">I am glad to see the province of Alberta has made that decision. I do not know if the federal Conservative Party supports what Premier Kenney is doing based on one or two comments today. Premier Kenney is right to put in these restrictions. The numbers are concerning. In the report it said that hospitals were treating 671 patients with the illness as of Tuesday, including 150 in intensive care beds. The numbers matter. We know that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680578">I used to be the health critic in the province of Manitoba. There is a limited number of ICU beds. We should all be concerned. I was concerned when Manitoba had the highest cases in the country in November. I was concerned about what was taking place in the province of Ontario. Many of my Ontario colleagues talked about how serious the situation was and how we had to be on message and communicate to people what could do to get through this third wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680579">I am concerned today about what is taking place in a province I care deeply about, the province of Alberta. The message I would like to leave for the people of Alberta is that the full weight of the Government of Canada, that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada, who has a very caring heart for the province of Alberta, is very much watching, listening and communicating with the province of Alberta, whether it is the premier or other leaders. Alberta will pull through because of the health care professionals, because of people coming together despite what many members of the Conservative members of Parliament might be saying this evening.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680606">It is a privilege to speak on behalf of the constituents of Edmonton Mill Woods. My constituents, like those right across Canada, are having a very difficult time coping with the current spike in COVID-19 cases and the accompanying lockdowns. It is unfortunate that we are even in this position to be having this emergency debate and that we could have so easily been in an emergency debate on many of the cases that we have seen and are currently seeing right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680607">In the last seven days, we have seen the Atlantic bubble burst, with Nova Scotia seeing nearly 800 cases over the last week. Nunavut, which just weeks ago had zero cases, is now facing its own outbreak. We are still seeing British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec continue to cope and grapple with the third wave. We are in this position today because the response of the Liberal government throughout the pandemic has been slow and confusing at every single step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680608"> Let us go back to the beginning of this pandemic when we were just seeing the reports of the first cases that we all then called the coronavirus. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252818" Type="2">Edmonton Riverbend</Affiliation>, then our shadow minister for health, had questioned the government consistently on its plans for stopping flights from Wuhan province, when the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> said that closing the border was not effective at all. On January 28, 2020, over a year ago, we learned from the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> that the first individual identified with the coronavirus did not self-identify when entering Canada. He had travelled from Wuhan and had a cough. The Minister of Health stated that this individual took exactly the appropriate precautions that he was given at the border, and that the systems were working and were working very well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680609">One year later, and with more examples than I have time to discuss tonight of the Liberal government's failure, our entire country is facing lockdowns and restrictions over and over again. This stands in stark contrast to places like the United States and Britain where restrictions are being eased and economies are reopening. What is the difference between Canada and those other countries? It is vaccines. While both the U.K. and the United States were rushing to secure vaccines for their citizens, Canada stood at the back of the line, dawdling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680610">The government pursued a dubious vaccine partnership with CanSino, a Chinese state-owned company. The deal fell apart almost immediately after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made the big announcement about it. It took only a week for the Chinese communist government to stop necessary materials from being exported to Canada so research and production could happen. It was the only leading vaccine that the Liberal government was pushing to be made in Canada. Instead of working with the private sector to build vaccine production capacity right here in our own country with companies like Providence Therapeutics, just one of the 17 companies that have submitted proposals to build and roll out pharmaceutical strategies in Alberta, the Liberal government decided to build a new vaccine facility which will not be ready until 2022 at the earliest, well after the pandemic should be under control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680611">The government's failure on procuring vaccines is shown with the wait times between the doses. The four-month wait period is longer than that of any other country in the world and contrary to the advice of the developer and manufacturer of that vaccine. The Liberal government has forced an off-label usage of vaccines only because there is insufficient supply. The NACI has acknowledged it would not be recommending a four-month delay if there were sufficient supply. This, of course, is leading to more COVID cases, more vulnerability. This is the result of the government's failures.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680612">As I mentioned earlier, another massive failure by the Liberal government has been in being very slow on closing the border. For more than a year, we have been calling for greater border measures to protect against COVID-19 and ministers of the government said that we were spreading fear and scaremongering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680613">More recently, we saw the ravaging effect that the variants of the virus were having. The double variant in India was first identified in October. The government continued to see variant cases pop up right across our country, most notably in British Columbia and Ontario. Now we are seeing the effects of these variants right across the country. Today, nearly 60% of the active cases in Alberta are variant cases. Simply, we needed the government to listen to our calls to secure the border. Its slowness is why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680614">Despite all of that, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has come out and said he has no regrets regarding his leadership throughout this pandemic. That is astonishing. He has no regrets that the government shut down our pandemic early warning system months before COVID-19 happened. He has no regrets that the government sent hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves, gowns and the government's own reserves to China, leading to our own health care professionals and first responders being forced to ration their own PPE and recycle masks. He has no regrets on telling Canadians that the risk was low at the beginning of the pandemic. He has no regrets about not securing our border at the beginning of the pandemic or stopping flights from hot spots earlier as variants were ravaging countries across the globe. He has no regrets about the mental health crisis that my community of Edmonton Mill Woods and communities right across Canada have been struggling with as a result of lost lives, livelihoods and more lockdowns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680615">For us to prevent the surge in cases we are seeing right across Canada, we needed to vaccinate Canadians in January and February, like the United States did. By the end of February, only 4% of Canadians had received their first shot, while 10% of Americans were fully vaccinated. From the very beginning, the Liberal government has been slow and confused at every step, leading us into this situation. Its slowness to procure the vaccines that we needed was a major contributor to this third wave. Its slowness to close the borders as highly contagious variants were emerging across the globe left us vulnerable to the same variants that are driving the third wave today. My constituents in Edmonton Mill Woods and all Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>

It did not have the vaccines available to give to Albertans. As soon as Alberta received the vaccines, the rate at which they went into the arms of Canadians and Albertans was very high. It was one of the best rates in the country, but the province can only do that once it receives the vaccines. As we know, right across the country we have been receiving vaccines much later than other countries. That is what we need to beat this pandemic. I am certain we will now. I know there are more vaccines coming. There have been more announcements. I hope those vaccines show up so Canadians can get back to their lives, small businesses can open up again and kids can get back to school, but we needed those vaccines in January and February. Unfortunately, they did not arrive. I am looking forward to them coming now.</ParaText>

I am so glad that those constituents have such a fantastic MP advocating for them. I sensed the passion in his speech, and I share that passion. My thoughts tonight, as we are having this conversation, are with my constituents here in Edmonton—Wetaskiwin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680627">It has not just been a tough last year and a bit, but a tough five years for the people of our province and of my riding. When COVID hit in March 2020, we woke up to a different world on March 11, 12 and 13, and the government put in place programs to deal with the emerging situation. One of the things that was really tricky was that many of the income support programs did not actually address the needs of my constituents. They had been on EI long enough that their benefits were just about to run out or were running out, so they did not qualify for the early programs put in place by the government. Things have been tough here financially for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680628">From that time to where we are today, many months later, one of the challenges has been a complete lack of transparency and accountability on the part of the government, and it started almost immediately. We had two weeks when we were supposed to be sitting, with a weird schedule of three constituency weeks thrown in. For these five weeks we had an opportunity to shut down Parliament and rely on the advice of some of the world's best public health experts to treat Parliament as an essential service and get back to work. Members from all sides could have been acting on behalf of their constituents, and those of us in the opposition parties could have been asking tough questions of the government to come up with the best policies to serve Canadians. Instead, Parliament was largely shut down for the better part of six months. It sat as a glorified committee most of the time, when it sat at all. Of course, we had the six-week prorogation period when everything was shut down so that the government could avoid scrutiny on some particular problematic programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680629">We finally came back in late September. Ever since then, question after question from members of the Conservative Party, but also from the NDP, the Bloc, the Greens and independents, was met with condescension and derision. It is immeasurable how many times Liberal ministers, led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, stood in the House of Commons and, rather than actually answering a question, met the question with an accusation of partisanship. We have seen it tonight in the debate. For example, a couple of minutes ago we saw the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> talk about using 10 minutes to cast blame, and he was talking about the previous Conservative member's speech. The Conservative member simply brought up issues that are the responsibility of the federal government. As a federal member of Parliament serving his constituents, it is his responsibility to ask those questions or bring up those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680630"> We heard the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> earlier talk about opposition members playing partisan games tonight. We heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> make all sorts of accusations, and accuse me of being untruthful when I asked a question of him. Here is the funny thing about it. His response was in reference to March 13 numbers and where we were in terms of doses administered by countries. I was referencing March 13. On that day we were behind the U.K., U.S., Turkey, Germany, Italy and France. He put forward misinformation in his accusation of untruthfulness. This is the constant, daily m.o. of the government right now, and it is problematic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680631">Right now, I think members from all sides, but particularly members of the Conservative Party, have rightly raised the issue of vaccinations. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680632">As we have raised the issue of vaccinations, going back to when we were raising those issues in November, December, January and February and when we were not completely discounted out of hand, the promise that was given was that a whole bunch of vaccines would be coming down the road, far in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680633">Here we are today. The vaccines did not come in time, and across the country there is a price being paid for the fact that the vaccines did not come in time. The lockdowns we are seeing in different parts of the country are part of the price that is being paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680634">I liken the response to the question of when vaccines are going to come to buying an old house with old wiring and no fire extinguishers. There might be a chance to redo the wiring one day when it can be afforded, but imagine having a family meeting and bringing up the issue of fire safety. Imagine one of the kids saying that they heard in class they should have three fire extinguishers in their house. Imagine, as a parent, saying that instead of getting three fire extinguishers for the house they were going to wait until September, and in September they would get 15 fire extinguishers, three per member of the family, many months from now. Imagine the reaction of the kids who were simply raising what the experts were saying was best for the house.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680635">That has been the response of the government. Somewhere down the road, by September, everybody who wants a vaccination will get one. Clearly there is a price to be paid for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680636"> I have pointed out multiple times tonight, and I think it is worth pointing out again, that as of today, we were at 37.85 doses administered per 100 Canadians. If we are going to talk about information, let us deal with real information. That is 37.85 doses administered. Fifty-two days ago, on March 13, the U.K. passed that threshold. On the same day, the U.S. was at 31.61 doses administered per 100 people. On that day, Canada was at 7.77 doses administered, or one-fifth of where the U.K. was. Imagine if we had met the same standard, and had taken it as seriously as other countries. We would not be in the predicament we are in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680637">Tonight we are talking about Alberta. Let us look at the Alberta situation. Today we have 146 Albertans in the ICU. On March 13, we had 35. Today we had 2,271 new cases. On March 13, we had 474. Again, imagine if we were at 35 doses administered per 100 Canadians, instead of 7.77 on that day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680638">It is absolutely fair and right for opposition parties to hold the government to account for its lack of performance, and to ask tough questions about where we are going. It is absolutely right for Canadians to expect their government to answer those questions. That has not happened up to this point. I hope that for the rest of tonight and moving forward, Canadians and Albertans particularly, the folks we are elected to represent, can expect answers from their federal government.</ParaText>

In fact, it has published those on a website. Aside from minor changes to delivery schedules, which happened due to suppliers and changes in those suppliers' facilities, etc., more doses have been coming in than the targets that were committed to.</ParaText>

The member rightly pointed out that the issue is numbers, targets and performance. That is what we are here to do.

Of course, we can cherry-pick different examples that seem to have been effective, but there are many studies that undermine the idea that blanket lockdowns are effective. There are many jurisdictions, for example Florida in relation to California, that have not been doing the lockdowns and are doing quite well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680662">It is an honour to rise today to talk about such an incredibly important issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680663">The member from Edmonton asked why I was taking the approach that the Conservatives are being overly partisan about this. It is because they have come into the House, and every Conservative, one after another, has only talked about vaccines. Yes, vaccines are very important. They are important to getting through this. They are important to getting through to the other side, but there are other important things too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680664">When the Conservatives come in here and only talk about vaccines, it makes me wonder why they will not talk about things that the provincial governments are responsible for, or other things the federal government could be doing. I think there is a lot of criticism to go around. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680665">As we look back on this years from now, we will be able to say the federal government should have done this, or the federal government should have been more prepared. I hope we learn from this. If we do not learn from this, then what will we have accomplished?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680666"> First and foremost, I hope we learn that we need to do something about our vaccine manufacturing in this country, our biomanufacturing of vaccines. We need to make sure that when the next pandemic happens, because history tells us it will at some point, we are better prepared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680667">I am willing to let that responsibility go around, and I am willing to say that Liberals were just as responsible for that as Conservatives were in the past, but I do not think anyone saw it coming. Therefore, there was not an urgent need placed on it. Yes, we do need to do something about making sure that it is better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680668">When history looks back on this, we will also look at ourselves and say, when we were weighing the options, did we put too much emphasis on the economy and not enough emphasis on the advice of medical professionals? I really get a kick out of some of the stuff I have heard, not just today in this debate, but over the last number of weeks and months, and how sometimes there seems to be a complete disregard for the experts and for science. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680669">It is based on emotion. I do not want to say ideology, but it is based on emotion. I want this to be over too, but that does not mean I should believe everything I see on the Internet that suggests there is an easier way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680670">From the beginning, I have always said I will take my health advice from the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada and, more importantly, the medical officer of health in my riding of Kingston and the Islands, Dr. Kieran Moore, who has done a phenomenal job of taking care of our community. For some reason, there has been this desire out there to disregard experts. If we do not shut that narrative down, we are only complicit in helping that narrative snowball and build momentum. I think that people in the House are responsible for allowing narratives to continue on. </ParaText>

If I am on an airplane and the pilot suddenly passes out, and we are looking for someone to fly the plane, and someone says they are a pilot, I am going to tell them to get in the cockpit and land that thing. Likewise, I am going to believe the experts and the medical officers of health, the people who have studied pandemics and have planned for them, and take their advice.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680672">When they say lockdowns are important, then I am going to believe them. I do not understand how a body such as this, the House of Commons, has come to a place where we regularly disagree with medical experts. It absolutely boggles my mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680673">When the Conservatives come in here, they are only talking about vaccines. Yes, there is a lot we could have done to do a better job of making sure we were prepared, and that includes Conservatives, Liberals and opposition parties pushing the agenda. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680674">I know there were no Conservatives before March 2020 asking why we were not making more vaccines in the country or where our manufacturing is for this. Nobody was saying that over the last five or 10 years. No Liberal was saying it when Stephen Harper was the prime minister either because we did not see this coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680675">In the same regard, we have to respect the fact that we can criticize this government's approach and delivery of vaccines as a result of the infrastructure and resources that were in place. We can criticize that. It is fair to criticize. I think history can look back on that and see where we went wrong, where we went right and how it played out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680676"> What we cannot be critical about is that the government did lay out the exact plan. The provinces knew what the timeline was going to be. They were told in the late fall what they should expect in terms of vaccines coming along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680677">The only part of that plan that had a hiccup was the 10 days back in February, which the Conservatives keep talking about, when one of the primary delivery manufacturers of vaccines retooled its plant so that it could produce more vaccines, but we still ended up getting caught up very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680678">By the end of March, provinces received more vaccines than they were told they were going to have. They were originally scheduled to get 29 million vaccines by the end of June, but now they will be getting closer to 50 million. They are getting more vaccines than they were told they were going to get.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680679">Yes, we can be critical, but the provinces knew this was the schedule. In Ontario, and I am sure it is the same in Alberta, the province, on February 11, had its projection of the third wave and knew exactly what it would be getting and when it would be getting it. The federal government delivered more than it promised, yet the provinces still did not use other measures in order to curb the third wave. Instead, they relied on hoping that maybe, miraculously, things would go even better than the schedule, which was a horrible plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680680">I regret that we are here and having this conversation, as I am sure everybody does, but at the end of the day, I genuinely believe that, if a province wants to work with the federal government, it has to take the information we have been giving it on vaccines and plan according to that. They need to understand that medical experts are going to give them advice, and they could say the vaccines we are going to get will not get us beyond the third wave. They could say we better do something about this now and start talking about other measures, such as lockdowns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680681">I have yet to hear a Conservative tonight say that they support lockdowns, which I cannot understand because they have happened throughout the entire world, and they have been shown to be effective. This is just like two years ago when they could not utter the words “climate change”. They cannot even utter the words because they are afraid of saying it, and I do not know why.</ParaText>

Tell me what more the federal government is going to give as a result of invoking this particular piece of legislation. The federal government is there. When Ontario said it needed the Red Cross, the federal government asked how soon. When Ontario said it needed rapid tests, the federal government said it would get them there. Things rolled out and are rolling out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680693">The federal government is there. The federal government wants to help. The federal government is continually in contact with the provinces asking what more they want from us. I do not understand why invoking this piece of legislation written on a bill is going to make the situation any better in terms of delivery. We will give them what they want. We will be there for the provinces. They just have to work with us, which they have been doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680694">Mr. Speaker, it is important we reflect on the fact this motion is about an absolute public health crisis going on in a Canadian province right now. It is not just the risk to an individual. When our health system's capacity is overwhelmed, if someone gets in a car accident there may not be a place for them to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680695">The Conservative argument has been essentially that their vaccines did not come quickly enough. If we accept their argument, which I do not, I still do not understand how it justifies not putting in place the other public health measures we know will save lives. Can the hon. member offer his thoughts on the importance of putting those public health measures in place until there is herd immunity through vaccination to ensure we can save lives we know will be lost in the absence of these kinds of measures?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680699">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to follow my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>. I could have listened to a 20-minute speech by him. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> also gave a speech that I really appreciated this evening. I will pick up on her speech, as well as the speech just given by the member for Kingston and the Islands. The point of this debate is truly important and they both touched on the theme. I am sure others have, but I am calling these two members out in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680700">Where the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> finished off is where I would like to begin. He spoke about how we can look back at where we could have done things better, where things were done well, where we were a success story or where we need to be better prepared. He and I both came from municipal politics, where there were all these plans in place and after years and years of a pandemic or an emergency not coming, unfortunately, sometimes plans sit on the shelf. I am not saying that is the right approach, but the lessons we are learning are incredibly important and a constant reminder to never take our eye off emergency preparedness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680701">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> said that we can look back and do that work, but what has been frustrating in listening, in particular, to Conservative members is all they are doing is looking back. I made note of some of them. One pointed out where we were 52 days ago. My God, how the people of Alberta must feel hearing that tonight. What are we going to do today, tomorrow and the days and weeks after that to support and help the people in this country? We can look back on vaccines, we can look back on whatever else the Conservatives want to look back at, but are we not going to focus our collective energy to support the people in this country now?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680702">I am listening to this debate as a member from Ontario and people in my home province are living it now. I think about the anxiety people felt when these spikes first happened, the confusion, the lockdowns, no lockdowns and the pointing of fingers. I think of my friends, neighbours and family who just want to know how we are going to get through this. That is what our government has been focusing on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680703">Many members have spoken about no country being perfect, but that does not mean we stop acting. It means we continue to move forward, to provide the supports the provinces and territories need. It means getting vaccines faster, getting the Red Cross out to support the vaccination efforts, if need be. It is seeing health care providers in Newfoundland and Labrador coming to Ontario to help support health care workers. It is seeing people step up in unimaginable ways during this time. It is what else the federal government can do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680704">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> just said, we will work with provinces and territories and provide whatever they need, particularly in Alberta, providing mobile health units, contact tracing, rapid tests, funds for the safe restart agreement to help protect and insulate between the second and third waves, even between the first and second waves. The government has provided whatever each province and territory has needed. Every province and territory in this country is different, has different needs and requires different resources. We have been there. We have heard Quebec members talking about the supports needed in long-term care. We were there for that. We were there for PPE.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680705">We should not be talking about all the things that we have done; we should talk about all the things we are going to continue to do until we are through this. That is what Canadians expect of us. That is what this debate should be about and why I noted the speech of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. This is the debate we should be having.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680706"> Conservatives consistently stand up and say there is confusion and mixed messaging. Nothing has frustrated me more because the confusion and mixed messaging is coming from the Conservatives themselves. They can go back to early March of this year when their own health critic was saying to remove border restrictions, ease the border restrictions, that all they need is a pre-boarding test and then a test when they land and people should just go on their way. If we had listened to them, we would not have caught those people who had tested positive after being tested when they landed. They would not have been in isolation and they would have been out in the community. Again, there are additional measures we can continue to take and we will happily be here to support Canadians to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680707">They are Conservatives who constantly stand in this place and say, “we do not need restrictions, we need freedom”. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> posts pictures when he is sitting outside, eating on a patio and goes, “freedom”. Then, they have the nerve to come in this place and say that vaccines would have solved everything when they refused to listen to the public health experts, and not even Canadian public health experts if they do not want to trust Canadians. Globally, we know that vaccines are an important tool, but they will only work if the public health measures are also in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680708">The Conservatives love to quote the U.S. or Israel or the U.K. for their programs, but the U.K. and Israel both saw, during their vaccination campaigns, that as they lifted restrictions too quickly they saw spikes. We heard testimony from experts at the health committee. Governments there quickly realized that vaccinations are not the only tool, they have to be done in conjunction with strong public health measures to give vaccinations the time to work, the time to be distributed across the communities and to become effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680709">It is this ignorance of listening to the public health advice, which is not governments' opinions but public health advice, that is frustrating to watch because I see people suffering, I see small businesses close and I see people being sick. To send out a message saying that if only we had done this nobody would have suffered is simply unfair to Canadians. We need to be honest with Canadians that as our vaccine campaign is rolling out and everybody needs to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated, we also need to listen to the public health advice. Those mixed messages coming from the Conservatives, saying lockdowns are not needed and looser border measures would be okay are just not truthful, are not helpful and are certainly not going to help the people of Alberta or those in my home province of Ontario or anywhere else across this country as we battle this third wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680710">I hope we get to the point where we are having conversations about what more we can do to support Alberta, what more we can do to support any jurisdiction in this country to get through this third wave, and actually acknowledge and admit that the public health measures are there to work in conjunction with vaccines and that we are only going to get through this if we listen to the experts and medical health professionals who know what they are talking about. We have seen it work in other countries, so we do not even need to imagine it; we know it is real. I truly hope that the Conservative members will come and work with us on helping to support our fellow Canadians during this difficult time.</ParaText>

We have not acted like a federation during this pandemic, and it is really disappointing.

              <ParaText id="6680724">As I enter into the emergency debate related to the crisis that is taking place here in Alberta, I want to acknowledge that there are a number of friends of mine currently in the hospital. It appears that they are going to pull through, but it has been a challenging time for many Albertans and many, many Canadians. Certainly it drives home the seriousness of what we are discussing in this place. I also want to acknowledge the 24,000 or so Canadians who have passed away because of COVID and COVID-related complications. I was reading an article earlier today about the so-called “COVID long-haulers” and the challenges they have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680725">On the other side of that issue are the millions of Canadians who are facing significant impacts, as well as businesses. As I was getting groceries earlier today, a business owner came up to me asking if there was anything I could do to help him get support as his business fell through all the cracks, in terms of qualifying for support. It did not quite meet the income threshold on the months that were prescribed, but had zero income in certain other months. It speaks to the significant challenges that all Canadians have faced in the last year and a half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680726">When I learned that this debate would be taking place, I thought of a couple of main subjects that I want to touch on: one, the challenges that many Canadians are facing as this third wave has gripped Alberta and gripped our country, and to ensure that there is some context provided with some of the challenges that certainly my constituents are facing in Battle River—Crowfoot, and then to talk about some of the other challenges and the reason why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680727">I found it very interesting listening to some of the Liberal members. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was asked a number of weeks ago whether there was anything he regretted. There have been a number of analogies used in this debate this evening, so I will use another one: When a sports team, be it someone's favourite hockey team or favourite football team, makes some mistakes, the people who take responsibility are the captain of the team and the coaches. They take responsibility for their mistakes and they commit to do better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680728">I heard for the first time a number of Liberal members admit their failures, because the captain of their team, the leader of this country, refuses to admit mistakes. Unfortunately, it is not surprising. I have been a long-time political observer and a member of Parliament for a year and a half. Seeing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personality, it is unfortunately not surprising that he refuses to take responsibility for some of these clear failures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680729">Then we see the members opposite trying to pivot the blame. They say that Conservatives spread the misinformation. I have dozens of pages of clear examples, numerous examples of inconsistent messaging and changing direction. The fact is that even the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> said very clearly that had we gotten more vaccines, we would not be having this debate. A number of the Liberal members opposite have said things like “Well, we only want to talk about vaccines.” Well, it seems like the Liberals only wanted to stop talking about vaccines when their failures on the procurement of those vaccines became widespread. Then, all of a sudden, Canadians were seeing the consequences of that, and we see that now. This truly is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s third wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680730">I think back to the beginning of the pandemic, when I, among many other Conservatives, started asking questions about securing our borders. They were valid questions about what was happening with this virus, which we did not know very much about, and we started asking about measures being taken. I remember the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> stood up and said that the government had put in enhanced border measures, yet I would talk to constituents who had just returned home who said that they did not see any border measures. I talked to some constituents who saw those border measures, and literally, and I wish this was a joke, the enhanced border measure was a check mark on the immigration form. As the old saying goes, “An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure”, and I think that is the reality we are facing, with tens of thousands of lives lost and other significant challenges that we face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680731">I say often that the government is all style and very little substance. Unfortunately, that has been the case throughout this pandemic, and I would suggest the last five and a half or so years as well, as has been highlighted through the many other failures and tragedies of what this Liberal government has done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680732">I was speaking to somebody who closely follows the National Research Council, and even some of the regulatory changes that the Liberals brought in right after they were elected actually put Canada further back in terms of being set up to succeed in the case of needing to see rapid investment in emerging health technologies, like vaccines. This was a number of years before the word “COVID-19” was even known to the world, and that really comes back to the issue of good governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680733">The Liberals will say, “Well, it is easy to be an armchair quarterback and speak from hindsight.” This is what the Liberals like to talk about to try to pivot away from their failures. However, we see time and again with the current government that truly it has been a failure of good governance. We see things like ministerial responsibility, which, in some cases, appears to have been abandoned. The Liberals simply use it as a way to cover up their scandals but then do not provide the oversight. I have filed hundreds of ATIPs since getting elected, and some of the things I see and do not see are astounding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680734">I have a couple of minutes left here to talk about some of the things that my constituents have brought up over the last number of months, such as the border issue that the government brought in. Conservatives were critical of the border hotels, especially when the minister himself said that there was no evidence that would work. There could have been other measures that were more effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680735">On mental health, we have seen the government support a Conservative motion for a 988 number, yet it has done virtually nothing since. It has made some announcements in terms of dollars in its yearly budget, which was released a couple of weeks ago. Again, it is promising dollars but no action.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="30">(2230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680736">A great example is the Service Canada office that is located down the street from my constituency office, where I am currently giving this speech. A sign was put on the door saying that it was closed, and there was a website on it. Hundreds of people sought help from my office, because constituents could not be served by the government. Again, on good governance there was a lack of responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680737">As I have mentioned, we see businesses falling through the cracks. We see mixed messaging on vaccines. This has been a big challenge. I have had phone calls this week, and people are asking what to believe and who to believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680738">There is certainly much more I could say, but it has been good to participate in this debate. Hopefully I highlighted some of the issues that my constituents have brought forward to me over the last number of weeks and months, and in the last year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680740">When he looks at the investments we have made, the member has to keep in mind that what our government did was done for all of the provinces and territories. We invested $19 billion for the safe restart program, and we distributed vaccines right across the country, fairly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680741">The member is pointing the finger and asking why we are in this situation, and I think some of the premiers have to look at themselves in the mirror, as do some members of Parliament. They should not be laying the blame on someone else. They should look at what is happening in their provinces and ask how we can help Albertans, because we are here to help Albertans and all Canadians.</ParaText>

There have been some tremendous advances that our province has pioneered. That may be why there are no Liberal members of Parliament from Alberta these days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680743">There is a lot of introspection being done. In fact, I listened to the premier talk last night. The government members say that the Government of Alberta has to take responsibility for not being able to deal with the vaccine situation. However, it has been made very clear that the issue was not about the ability to distribute vaccines and get needles into the arms of Albertans. The issue was that there was no supply.</ParaText>

He is absolutely correct to point out that Canada has been trailing much of the industrialized world because of the absence of proper vaccine distribution. However, he has avoided the question. Alberta actually has the highest infection rate in North America. Alberta, unlike any other province or state, has an absolutely deplorable and tragic record that is leading to real tragedy for many Alberta.</ParaText>

I have heard time and time again about how frustrated they have been with the lack of leadership at the federal level. Just to correct the record, because I know my friends in the UCP would ask me to do this, there were no funding cuts to health care. That is misinformation, to clarify the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680750">At the heart of the issue is the fact that the third wave came at a time when we needed to be three, four, five or six weeks ahead of schedule on vaccines. We have smart people across the country leading the way. In fact, there is a vaccine manufacturer in Calgary. However, it just announced that it may have to leave Canada to be successful.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6680754">Madam Speaker, I am always happy to be in the House to speak on behalf of my constituents, as I am a very proud member of Parliament from Alberta who was born and raised in Calgary Midnapore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680755">It certainly has been a very difficult 15 months, which goes without saying. It is the reason that we are here this evening. The pain that I have seen around me has been absolutely extraordinary. I have watched businesses, families and individuals attempt to cope with the realities of the pandemic and what it has meant for everybody, and have seen the sacrifices people have made across Canada, and particularly in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680756">I have seen businesses shut their doors, some after many years. That is incredibly regretful. It is the reason I decided to put forth the Calgary Midnapore Economic Recovery Task Force in an effort for us to try to come up with solutions as a community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680757">I have seen parents struggle with children being out of school as a result of the necessity to make changes to our educational system. Of course this is happening again. Tomorrow will be my son's last day in school until after the long weekend. Today, when I was at the car dealership picking up my car after servicing, I overheard a set of parents talking about it. They do not know how they are going to deal with it this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680758">Of course, there is also the terrible toll that mental health problems have taken on Canadians and Albertans during this time. I am very happy that as part of our plan to secure the future, our leader has chosen to make mental health one of the key pieces of the platform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680759">Like many other Canadians and like many other Albertans, I have a question on my mind: How did we get to this place? That is what this debate is really about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680760">I think back to January and February 2020 when we were in the House and still had many new members finding their feet. We had a strong team that tried to call on the government to take stronger action. I recall the member for <Affiliation DbId="252818" Type="2">Edmonton Riverbend</Affiliation> screaming at the top of his lungs in an effort to get the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to take action regarding our borders. Of course, we all know about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s terrible judgment in sending an extensive amount of personal protective equipment overseas to China, only to leave health care workers here without it. Those on the front lines were still defenceless weeks later. It was a very bad start to this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680761">Of course, we called for the government to use the tools that were available, but it refused to use them. Our team, across the board, including our current shadow minister for health, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, was relentless in asking the government to use the tools available, specifically therapeutics and rapid tests. However, this fell upon the deaf ears of the government. Again, I ask the question: How did we get to this place?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680762">As shadow minister for transport, I can say that the industry did everything it possibly could in an effort to maintain operations and resume and maintain normalcy for Canadians so they could continue about their lives and their business. We have all been away from our family members and our loved ones for so long and have not had the opportunities to visit places and see people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680763">It was actually the industry that led the way on rapid testing. There was the project at YVR set up by WestJet. WestJet is an Alberta company that has suffered terribly as a result of the mismanagement of the pandemic by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="45">(2245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680764">We have the McMaster project, which led to incredible data finds, and could have been used in a constructive manner going forward, but it was not. Most importantly, and what I am most proud of, was the YYC pilot project, which was set up here with much success and would have allowed for a shorter quarantine time across the nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680765">Instead, we saw the government ignore the industry of those individuals who put themselves forward on the part of the data collection. Instead, we ended up with a terrible knee-jerk reaction from the government several times over, where both Canadians and industry had to respond with the 72-hour PCR test brought in at the worst time possible for travellers over the holidays, leaving industry without any time to respond at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680766">I must take a moment and compliment what good corporate players and societal players the airline sector has been over and over by repatriating Canadians, and I have done a lot of that in my time as a consular officer previously for the Government of Canada; bringing in personal protective equipment; and really bringing in precious cargo. They are really doing their part, but again their requests and the work they put in were ignored by the government, leading to the 72-hour PCR test.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680767">Like anything, when we do not take action earlier on, the problem compounds. It just creates a larger and larger problem. This happens with anything in life. Certainly, we have even seen it within the government with debt, for example. The next step in that, regarding the transport file, was the resulting hotel quarantine. Again, this was something very severe and draconian that could have been avoided, had the government taken the proper steps earlier on in the pandemic, but it did not. Again, I, like so many other Canadians, find myself asking how we got to this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680768">Finally, the point that has been brought up by my colleagues previously, and which I will mention again, is that of vaccines. Everyone has always said the ticket out of this pandemic is the vaccines, but the government absolutely failed at its procurement strategy from day one. The result is that we have been left months behind other nations. We see they are beginning to live life again and beginning to return to normal not only within the travel sector, but in life as we used to know it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680769">There have been numerous delays as a result of the government's terrible execution of procurement, overpayment for vaccines and us ending up last in line. It has not been transparent in regard to the schedules of these vaccines, leaving Canadians to wonder, as recently as this week, when they will get a second dose and not knowing when life will resume again as normal. There really is just no plan at all forward and no light at the end of the tunnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680770">Again, I ask myself how we got to this place. Canadians are asking how we got to this place. The reason we are having this debate here tonight regarding Alberta is how we got to this place, and the answer is obvious. It is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who brought us to this place. It is the Prime Minister and his incompetent cabinet and government that brought us to this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680771">I will finish with the very member, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252961" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation>, who proposed the debate this evening. She has been complicit in holding them in this place.</ParaText>

That is what this discussion should be about tonight, not who is doing better, who is doing worse.

              <ParaText id="6680785">Since the beginning of the pandemic, Canadians have come together, made sacrifices and done their part to help limit the spread of the virus. Public health experts have provided Canadians with important information and advice on COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680786">At the same time, the Government of Canada has taken steps to help Canadians stay home, put food on the table, keep their jobs and help businesses stay afloat. Canada's COVID-19 economic response plan has helped protect millions of jobs, provide emergency support to families and keep businesses afloat throughout the pandemic. Healthy people are at the centre of a strong economy. That is why the health and safety of all Canadians remains our top priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680787">The situation remains challenging in some parts of the country. As COVID-19 activity continues in Canada, we are tracking a range of epidemiological indicators to monitor where the disease is most active, where it is spreading and how it is impacting the health of Canadians, and public health's laboratory and health care capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680788">Alberta is in the middle of a third wave right now. The situation regarding COVID-19 in Alberta is of utmost importance to the federal government, and although I am an Ontario member of Parliament, I understand the predicament, because we are experiencing the same thing here at home. I would like to note the current situation to give some context to this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680789"> As members know, Alberta currently has the highest active case rate in either Canada or the U.S. The current active COVID-19 case total stands at 23,623, which is the highest ever. The daily COVID-19 case counts have topped the 1,000 mark for almost a month. Alberta's test positivity rate is now 13.2%, its highest ever, which means one in eight Albertans tested positive for COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680790">Yesterday, Alberta reported 1,743 new cases, including a very large percentage of variant cases. This is a situation that is very serious, to put it mildly. We are greatly concerned to see that Alberta currently has the highest per capita case rate anywhere in Canada. In Alberta, elevated infection rates continue to impact COVID-19 severity indicators, particularly in areas with sustained high levels of disease activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680791">We are monitoring the spread of new variants in the province, as well as the strain put on public health resources with nearly 700 people in hospital with COVID-19 and more than 150 of those in intensive care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680792">Premier Kenney announced new COVID-19 restrictions yesterday. These included transition to restaurant takeout service only, closure of personal care businesses and a shift to online learning for all students from May 7 to May 25. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680793">However, there is hope. Mass vaccination is proceeding and accelerating. I am heartened to note that Alberta has administered more than 1.6 million doses of vaccine provided by the federal government, exceeding the 30% first dose coverage. Since May 4, teachers, child care workers and support staff in Alberta are eligible to book COVID-19 vaccine appointments. Alberta is also targeting vaccines in hot spot areas. This includes oil sand work camps in Fort McMurray and Wood Buffalo region, as well as oil sand workers in Calgary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680794">Earlier today, Premier Kenney announced that starting on May 6, every Albertan 30 years of age and older can be vaccinated. By May 10, every Albertan 12 and older will be eligible for vaccination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680795">Unfortunately, as our public health authorities consistently remind us, vaccines are not a replacement for strong public health measures, at least not in the short term. The key to reducing the number of cases is to reduce the number of transmissions. To do this, we must have clear enforced measures to discourage social contact and mobility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680796">We know the majority of Albertans support listening to advice of public health experts and support taking the steps necessary to protect their friends, family and neighbours. The federal government is providing assistance to Alberta for testing and contact tracing and surge support in first nation communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680797">There have been 47 vaccination clinics established in the 47 first nation communities in Alberta and 56% of adults from first nations have had at least one shot and 25% have had a second dose. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680798">In addition to vaccines, our government has supported the people of Alberta by expanding access to rapid testing. More than three million rapid tests have been shipped by the federal government to the province of Alberta. The province has deployed more than two million of these tests and recently eased requirements so it is easier for businesses of all sizes to implement workplace testing programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680799">The federal government has also shipped rapid testing supplies directly to a number of large employers in Alberta free of charge, including Telus, TransMountain, Sunterra Farms, Rio Tinto, J.D. Irving and Loblaws. We also have 41 Statistics Canada contact tracers working with Alberta health authorities to try to trace and stem the spread of COVID-19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680800">We support the efforts of the people of Alberta to fight this virus. The federal government stands ready to support Alberta's citizens and Alberta's health care workers in any way we can. The Government of Canada stands ready to provide additional support to Alberta should it be requested by the province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680801">We continue to manage the impacts of the pandemic while preparing for future waves. This includes steps to ensure Canadians can access future treatment and vaccines. To help prevent future waves of the virus, we will continue to ensure we have personal protective equipment, a strong health care system and the right measures to limit the spread of the virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680802">We must also look for early warning signs so we can quickly respond to future waves. Our country's recovery from the pandemic will take time. Canadians must continue to be careful and listen to the advice of our public health experts. The pandemic has offered an opportunity to think about what really matters in our communities, engage in meaningful conversations about taking care of those around us and reflect on the kind of future we want to build. Together we will build a fair and more resilient Canada that works for everyone.</ParaText>

I could spend time going through the opposition's speeches and everything they have said over the past months and find all kinds of inconsistencies.

We knew in January, we knew in February and we knew in March exactly when the vaccines were coming and how many were coming. That puts the responsibility on all of us, whether we live in Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick or British Columbia, to prepare accordingly.

I think of the people I have met in Calgary and spending time in the city and in some of the suburbs, and going to Calgary Skyview. I met the Sikh community in the Dashmesh gurdwara. I think about spending time at my first Calgary stampede and in Edmonton. I used to visit pretty regularly. I have been to the Rocky Mountains.

New Democrats support this call, and we want to have a discussion about what we could do to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680830">Knowing that health care workers on the front lines are stretched thin, knowing that there is a high rate of infection, and knowing that there is a high rate of positivity in Alberta, what are we going to do to help?</ParaText>

When we are in a pandemic, when we are in a crisis, real leadership is not hiding behind excuses or looking for excuses. Real leadership is looking for solutions. We need the federal government to step up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680832">There is a difference between placing blame for the mistakes of the past and putting pressure on the government to act right now. We need the federal government to step up and provide more help to Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680833">We know another concrete thing the government could do right now is to improve access to paid sick leave. Experts across this country, including medical health experts and public health experts, have all said better access to paid sick leave will help reduce the spread of COVID-19. That is something the federal government could do right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680834">I want to be very clear. I am calling for improving the existing federal paid sick leave program that New Democrats fought for. What is the point of having a program that does not actually work? This emergency debate is an opportunity for us to talk about solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680835"> One solution is to, please, fix the paid sick leave program so that it actually works, so that workers do not have to make the impossible choice between going into work sick or staying at home and not knowing if they can pay their bills. When people do not have paid sick leave and they do not have income coming in when they stay at home, they will not be able to stay at home. It is just not a choice that a worker can make. We need to provide workers with that support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680836">We need to make sure that people have the opportunity to take time off to get vaccinated. If someone is working and they need every single paycheque, and they are living paycheque to paycheque, they cannot take time off to get vaccinated. They simply cannot afford to. We need to put in place a paid sick leave program that works. That is a concrete step that the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table has called for and experts across Canada have called for. It is something we could do right now. That is a concrete step we could take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680837">We could ensure that Alberta gets additional supports when it comes to vaccines. We could ensure that Alberta gets additional supports when it comes to frontline workers. We could look at all federal resources, including considering bringing in the military to provide support. Alberta needs help. The people of Alberta need help.</ParaText>

That is why the member for <Affiliation DbId="252961" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> called for this emergency debate, so we could talk about solutions. What could we do right now to provide help?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680839">It is important for us to acknowledge that the pandemic has shown us that we are all connected. When there is an outbreak in another country and the numbers increase, it impacts the entire world. When there is an increased rate of infection in our province, in a neighbouring province, anywhere in Canada, it impacts all of us. We have a shared responsibility to care for each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680840">This pandemic has shown us something. When we look out for one another, when we take care of one another, we are better off, we are stronger and we have a better response. Right now, the people in Alberta need our support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680841">Let us look at some other solutions. Something else we need to consider is how we could deploy a national support system. What we have called for in the past is looking at establishing, wherever there is a federal building, wherever there is federal resources, and deploying assistance in a tandem or parallel vaccination site, which could be set up federally to assist in the provincial efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680842">We need to start looking for solutions. I want to find solutions to help out. We know increasing vaccinations, providing better sick leave and providing better supports would help. What are the other solutions? What could the Liberal government do right now, instead of saying that it has done its part and throwing its hands up? That is not good enough. We need to see more supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680843">I have spoken with some of the health care workers who are saying that if things continue to get worse, it could get to a point where they have to decide who gets access to ventilators and who does not. This is a real crisis. I have spoken to health care workers in other provinces who have seen the numbers increase, and they are burnt out. They are in shock at the numbers that are happening with increased cases and with people coming into ICU units.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680844">As the numbers increase, we are seeing entire families get infected. Workers who have to go into work get sick and then come home, bringing the illness back. Then entire families end up in the hospital. People are on ventilators. People are struggling to get into ICU units. None of this had to happen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680846">What I have noted, and have been troubled by, is that we do not see a response in proportion to how serious things are. When things are serious, when things are really bad, we need to have an immediate response that is proportional to the gravity of the problem we are up against. This is serious. This is really bad. What is the serious response that will address the needs right now? That is what we are calling for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680847">I can outline what New Democrats think should happen. We have said this from the beginning. We need better paid sick leave, we need better access to vaccines, we need better supports for workers and we need to make sure there is an all-hands-on-deck approach to getting everyone vaccinated. In particular, in Alberta where people are struggling right now, we need an all-hands-on-deck approach. The federal government needs to do everything possible and deploy every resource possible to support the people.

No, that person wants to get people out of the house to safety and security. They want to get family and loved ones out of the fire.

              <ParaText id="6680867">Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me to be able to speak about Alberta, the province I grew up in, live in, represent and love so much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680868">This is an important debate. I will say it has also at times been an odd debate, odd I think because the federal New Democrats, especially my hon. friend from Edmonton Strathcona, are using the federal House of Commons to offer a highly partisan critique of the UCP government in Alberta. I am not here to praise or critique the UCP government. I think I have enough to do seeking to hold the federal government accountable in the federal House of Commons, to push it to adopt policies that are in the national interest and protect Canadians by getting us out of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680869">The NDP members have declared that Canadians do not care about jurisdiction, they want politicians to act. To this, I would observe that jurisdictional details are actually extremely important to how we resolve this crisis. The federal government cannot impose gathering restrictions and provincial governments cannot control borders. Everyone needs to do their job in their own area of jurisdiction. It is silly to pretend that jurisdictional responsibility does not matter. Jurisdictional responsibility is crucial. Politicians need to understand where their responsibilities lie. Then they need to act in those areas of responsibility to do their part to get the outcomes that we are all looking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680870">What we have seen during too much of this crisis is an obscuring of responsibility. It is not just the NDP; many federal Liberals have also taken every opportunity to slam the actions of various provincial governments. That might be understandable if the federal government had carried off its own responsibilities flawlessly, but that is far from the case, so now instead of acting effectively it is often shifting responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680871">I want to pose what I think is the fundamental question for this conversation, the question Canadians have been asking for a long time. Let us end the finger-pointing between different levels of government and let us establish who is responsible for solving the problem of COVID-19 in Canada. Who is responsible for getting us out of this crisis, for charting a course to something different, for building a plan to get us beyond the current pandemic? Who is responsible?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680872">Too often we hear from the provinces that the feds should do certain things, we hear from the feds about what the provinces should do, meanwhile both are saying they are deferring to experts. The public health experts in different jurisdictions do not always agree with each other and do not actually have the ability to publicly contradict the politicians they report to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680873">Further, when it comes to expertise, it is, by its nature, specialized. One expert may be well placed to tell us about the spread of a disease, but less able to explain the social factors that contribute to whether or not people follow guidelines in certain situations. A different expert still may be required to explain the impacts on life and well-being that are associated with large-scale unemployment caused by certain kinds of policies. The point is that generally we expect politicians to gather the feedback of different experts and make a decision that synthesizes that feedback and applies collective values as dictated by the electorate. That is the point of having a democracy instead of an aristocracy of expertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680874">Today, the politicians say they are deferring to the experts when in reality the experts still report in private to politicians and politicians are the ones actually taking decisions, so again there is a lack of clarity about who is actually responsible. When I say “who” is responsible, I am not intending to refer to the World Health Organization, although it is evident that many people in this government would like to defer responsibility for their decisions to the WHO, even though it has been clear from the beginning there have been serious flaws in its approach and recommendations. The WHO is ultimately constrained by its member states. As we have seen, that has limited its action in particular, for instance, in response to identifying issues coming out of China at the beginning. There has been a lot of just passing back and forth the— </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680879">Making vaccines available to Canadians is critically important. Much has been said, I think very well, by my colleagues about the government's failure to do that. However, as we have also discussed, vaccines are not the whole picture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680880"> We live in an increasingly interconnected world where pandemics are going to become more and more common.

I spoke about that in a question that I addressed to the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> on March 25, 2020, well over a year ago.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Madam Chair, Canada must look at international comparisons and copy strategies used by countries that have been successful in controlling COVID-19. South Korea provides one such example. Its approach emphasizes widely available testing and tracking of the spread of the virus, making people aware of specific places where they might have been exposed and providing them with the test results as quickly as possible. This targeted testing and tracking approach has helped South Korea turn the corner. Taiwan's approach has been similar and similarly effective.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6680885">Earlier than that, on March 11 of the same year, I tabled a petition in the House calling on the government to strengthen border screening, including having effective temperature testing at the border. Because the federal government has responsibility for developing and approving new testing technology, for coordinating national systems of tracing, for securing our borders and, yes, for providing clear and accurate advice on masking, something else that the government unfortunately failed to do, it has failed to act and has, in many cases yet to act, in terms of putting in place the systems and charting the path that is going to get us out of this. That points to why we are still really in the midst of a third wave that has not hit many other countries around the world, a third wave that is in Canada and it is hitting every province at different magnitudes in different provinces. We have a third wave hitting this country because of a failure of the federal government to act in areas of its jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680886">I agree strongly with my colleagues about the vital necessity of making vaccines available. The Province of Alberta has been rapidly deploying vaccines as they have been made available, but we also must develop systems of effective border control, testing and tracing, things that the federal government must lead on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680887">On the issue of responsibility, it is important to say that it is not just about government. All of us are responsible. For our collective response to COVID-19 to work, citizens must choose to be engaged and there has to be a level of social trust.</ParaText>

It goes without saying that the spread of COVID-19 is determined by the practical actions of people on the ground, and it is only affected by the regulations that are in place insofar as those regulations are followed. However, trust also has to be earned. When we have a national government that has been inconsistent in the advice it has given, and that is routinely attacking the Province of Alberta and other provinces, it unfortunately undermines trust. The government, in addition to the policy measures, needs to work to rebuild trust with people on the ground, especially people in my province.</ParaText>

I am also disappointed that we are here tonight because this Liberal government failed to protect Canadians and Albertans, both their physical and mental well-being. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680905">We are in the middle of this third wave of the COVID pandemic. Many Canadians across Canada are struggling to cope with the rise of cases, harsh lockdowns and mental health struggles. This is very worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680906">While our neighbours to the south are seeing their hospitalization numbers go down, businesses reopening, restaurant patios opening again just in time for summer and fans returning to in-person sporting games, Albertans are facing yet another summer of restrictive lockdowns. I cannot help but know that, if our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> took different actions at the beginning, we would now be getting ready to attend in-person sporting events and having brunch with family and friends on patios. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680907">Make no mistake, this third wave and the damage it is doing to our mental health and the economy rests solely with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Under this Prime Minister's leadership, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> allowed our early pandemic warning system to be shut down just months before COVID-19 hit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680908"> This Prime Minister sent hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and gowns from the government's own reserve to China. A month later, health care professionals and first responders here at home were being asked to ration the use of personal protective equipment, recycle masks and limit their use of hand sanitizer, and in some cases they were using garbage bags as PPE. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680909">The government refused to close our borders at the onset, letting the virus spread across the country. It flip-flopped on whether or not Canadians should wear masks. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> repeatedly told Canadians that the risk of getting COVID was low. The Prime Minister was slow to roll out federal aid programs and wrong not to fix them when Conservatives raised concerns and offered productive solutions to help Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680910">Protecting Canadians is one of the most important responsibilities of the government. We cannot continue with lockdowns and social distancing. Canadians are getting fed up. They want to be able to do what our neighbours to the south are able to do. Therefore, here are some of the things that the government can do to put Canadians first. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680911">The government can develop a clear set of parameters for identifying risks presented by emerging variants and present this to the public in an easy-to-understand format. Canadians should have information on where the virus is spreading, emerging variants and vaccination levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680912">The government can provide real-time warnings to the Canadian public when new variants are detected around the world as well as when hot spots for this spread are revealed. This applies to locations here in Canada as well as abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680913">The double variant first detected in India was detected in October 2020. The government could require anyone who has been in the variant hot spot to undergo enhanced screening, quarantine measures or a combination of both depending on the risk evaluated by public health officials. It could require immediate rapid tests at airports for all domestic airline travel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680914">We have lost so much during this third wave, but how long this third wave lasts is completely dependent on how quickly this Liberal government responds and acts to protect Albertans and Canadians. Albertans can take some assurance that it was the Conservatives who stood up and called for a real plan to protect Canadians from this pandemic. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680915">In October 2020, the House passed a sweeping opposition motion to direct the health committee to study the COVID-19 pandemic and ordered the government to produce needed documents for the committee. This included information on the government's vaccine rollout and key related documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680916">In November 2020, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> penned an op-ed in the National Post calling for a better COVID-19 strategy from the government entitled “It's time for a better COVID strategy”. This included discussion of the government's inaction on vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680917">Additionally, members were able to question the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> in a four-hour session in the House of Commons committee of the whole regarding the government's failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680918">In December 2020, the House passed a motion calling on the government to be transparent on key information related to the COVID vaccine rollout.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680919">In January 2021, we were able to secure an emergency debate in the House of Commons on the vaccine shortage in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680920">In February 2021, we demanded that the chair of the health committee call an emergency meeting to discuss the COVID-19 variants and called on the Liberal MPs to stop the filibuster and to finally pass the motion to release the government's vaccine contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680921">The Conservatives' motion ended up passing, meaning the government will need to come clean on the details of the contract that it tried to hide. In March 2021, my colleagues at the health committee were able to hear from experts of the government ignoring the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommendations to not administer AstraZeneca to the 65-plus age group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680922">It has never ended. Every proper and correct thing the government could have done to address this pandemic and help Canadians get back to some sort of normalcy, it did not do. Instead, the Liberals did the complete opposite. It is shameful that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has allowed Canada to fall so far behind our allies. We need the Prime Minister to do better. We need vaccines to be delivered, not the ones that our allies are sending us, but the ones under our own contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680923">Canadians want to return to normal life. They want to have barbeques with their friends and neighbours. They want to be able to go to the movies and watch the latest blockbusters. Most importantly, they want to be able to see their family members who they have not seen in over a year, give them a big hug and socialize with them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6680937">I am very pleased to speak in the House this evening. First, I want to say my thoughts are with the people of Alberta. I think this is an important debate and I certainly would like to share a few thoughts. Particularly, I would like to focus my time on our vaccine and our vaccine rollout that began at the end of December and is currently picking up speed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680938">When COVID-19 asserted itself as a global public health threat at the beginning of last year, Canada mobilized on all fronts to develop a multi-faceted response to an extraordinary challenge. The federal government shaped its plan in a context of rapidly developing uncertainty, and worked with global and domestic communities, an organization of public health experts, to take in the full measure of this threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680939">The federal government continues to implement “Canada's COVID-19 Immunization Plan: Saving Lives and Livelihoods”. We are on track to offer all eligible and willing Canadians the opportunity to become vaccinated by the end of September this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680940">In the implementation of the immunization plan, the federal government engaged and consulted all level of governments, indigenous leaders, international partners, industry, and medical and science experts, among others. At the heart of it are our core principles: science-driven decision-making, transparency, coherence and adaptability, fairness and equity, public involvement and consistent reporting. These principles continue to govern and inform our vaccination rollout action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680941">The plan also outlined the steps in the rollout process: communicating with and engaging Canadians throughout the campaign; obtaining a sufficient supply of vaccines; obtaining regulatory authorization from Health Canada to ensure safety and efficacy of vaccines; allocating and distributing vaccines efficiently and securely; administering the vaccine according to a sequence of priority population identified by experts; and collecting data to monitor vaccine safety, effectiveness and coverage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680942">The federal government and the provinces, territories and indigenous communities are continuing to work closely together on all aspects of the vaccine rollout, specifically the delivery of equipment, ancillary medical supplies and vaccines. The provinces and territories have their vaccination administration programs under way, and are documenting and collecting the data on vaccine coverage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680943">During the preliminary period of our response, the Government of Canada successfully negotiated advance purchase agreements with manufacturers of seven different vaccine candidates. This strategy has enabled Canada to secure a diverse portfolio of vaccines and to procure more than enough vaccine doses needed to vaccinate every person in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680944">Last fall, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> signed the interim order respecting the importation, sales and advertising of drugs used in relation to COVID-19. This allowed the Government of Canada to expedite the review and authorization of vaccines for COVID-19. Health Canada has so far authorized four vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen. Three of them are currently being delivered to Canada, distributed across the country and administered to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680945">Given the ongoing aggressive global procurement of vaccines and the high demand for them, Canada can be proud of this accomplishment. Once a sufficient and diverse supply of vaccines for Canadians was secured through the advance purchase agreement, the focus shifted to deploying those vaccines across Canada. A number of features marked the early part of this phase and some of these saw the federal government develop guidance on priority population, resolve supply chains interruption, and support the provinces and territories in their preparation in receiving the vaccine.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="55">(2355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6680946">I am happy to report that we have made good progress in the vaccination rollout so far. In addition to distributing syringes and specialized freezers to the provinces and territories, we have distributed vaccines in the amount that has enabled over 30% of eligible adults in Canada to receive one dose of the vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680947">Pfizer has recently confirmed that it will delivering substantially more doses weekly during the coming months. This sustained increase in scheduled vaccine delivery will enable provinces and territories to have greater certainty in the planning of their vaccination program. The important groundwork we have done to date in establishing the vaccine rollout infrastructure will ensure a smooth and coordinated response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680948"> Thanks to the early efforts of the government to prepare for the steep increase in the volume of vaccines received, the process and infrastructure in distributing and administering the vaccine has been well established and continues to mature. As increased volumes are delivered to the provinces and territories, the federal government will continue to be responsive to the provinces, territories and indigenous groups to identify areas where assistance and support could be provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680949">I would like to share that, and I am sure many have seen the news, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> called Premier Kenney today to offer federal support as Alberta responds to an increase in COVID-19 cases. I know, coming from Ontario, that that federal response also came through with military personnel. I have to take the time tonight to thank Premier Furey from Newfoundland and Labrador for the support he has provided to Ontarians</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6680950">I would like to end tonight's debate by saying that despite the progress we are making with the rollout of vaccines in Canada, each and every one of us must continue to implement the public health measures that have proven to be effective at containing the spread of the virus. People should wear a mask, wash their hands, maintain a safe physical distance, do not congregate in large numbers, and please avoid non-essential travel</ParaText>
