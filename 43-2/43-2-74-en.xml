              <ParaText>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today. I want to thank my colleague from the west coast for seconding this important legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Nav Canada right now is in the process of considering closure of traffic control centres in Whitehorse, Windsor, Regina, Fort McMurray, Prince George, Sault Ste. Marie and St-Jean in Quebec. The government has not been assertive on this. It has said that it has to wait for a study to take place, but through economic development and the changes that would take place with aviation, Windsor would see significant consequences and upheaval during the time of this pandemic, especially to keep regional airports alive. We are asking for a delay of the study and the closures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government has said that it cannot stop the study from taking place because of legislation, so we have proposed tools for the government to stop the study and support air traffic control towers in existence right now. The excuse the government has that it cannot act would be lifted by this legislation. It could also be done through an order in council or through the government taking this legislation, just as it has taken previous legislation of mine in the past. I would encourage it to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In particular, I want to thank pilot Dante Albano. There are others, but he has been a coordinating person for this and was active in creating a petition that thousands of Canadians signed in support of this initiative. I also thank the Air Traffic Controllers Association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This affects economic development and safety. The Windsor airport has five different competing traffic zones, including the United States, that complicate this airspace. This legislation would give the government the power to immediately stop this nonsense, which will continue to go on for months, if not a year, with studies causing upheaval in local economies, putting public safety in jeopardy and, more important, creating confusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are hopeful that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will look at this and do it through an order in council or steal this legislation in a positive way and implement it. We need to ensure that when we build back from COVID. We have the proper tools to do so. I would argue that having the safety and protection at regional airports to do those things would be a net asset as opposed to the process right now , which is destabilizing our air industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The first petition is on the coup in Myanmar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners call on the government to condemn the coup in the strongest terms. They call for the immediate and unconditional release of all elected officials as well as political prisoners. They want the government to take actions against the Myanmar military and call for the repeal of an unlawfully declared state of emergency and respect the November 2020 election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners also call for an immediate law barring Canadian businesses from exporting arms and technologies to Myanmar and to put forward to the General Assembly of the United Nations a resolution calling for member states to address the long-term threat to peace and stability in Myanmar. They would like to see members of the Myanmar military and their families and associates barred from pursuing education or business opportunities in Canada as well as a draft resolution, a motion, to refer this matter to the International Criminal Court.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the next petition I am presenting is on the rental subsidy program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners would like to draw the attention of the Government of Canada to the fact that many businesses are not currently eligible for the rental subsidy program because they are non-arm's length tenants. They draw to government's attention to the fact that for 22 years many businesses have been engaged in the tourism industry and are leasing or renting units. They would like the government to reconsider the rental subsidy program and ensure tenants who are currently excluded are included in this program. They request that the Government of Canada change the legislation so businesses are no longer falling through the cracks.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to present a petition regarding Bill <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">C-6</Document>. The petitioners have serious concerns about the consequences of the legislation, including limiting the options available for LGBT Canadians to receive counselling and the criminalization of conversations between children, their parents and other mentors about sexuality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A recent Nanos poll has found that 91% of Canadians agree that consenting adults should be free to get the sexuality counselling of their choice regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This is consistent across regions, age and gender. This is precisely what Bill <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">C-6</Document> would ban, counselling that Canadians may choose for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners want to see a conversion therapy ban but not this conversion therapy ban. Bill <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">C-6</Document> would ban more than conversion therapy. Let us fix the definition used in the bill so we can ban the harmful and degrading practices that have no place in Canada, while maintaining the supports available for LGBT Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise virtually in the House this morning to present a petition signed by many constituents. It relates to the Saanich Inlet. Those who do not live on Vancouver Island will not be aware that there is a small inlet, like the space between my thumb and my index finger, just above Victoria. In that inlet, there is a very significant risk of contamination from mostly recreational boaters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners urge that the Saanich Inlet be declared a non-sewage discharge area. This has been done, as some of the members from Cape Breton Island will know, for the Bras d'Or Lake. They urge the government take action and work with the province to declare Saanich Inlet a zero-discharge area. It has very low flushing capacity, it is an area that has increasingly strong biodiversity, but it must be protected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>She said: Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252876" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Before I start, I want to tell Lynne Walker that this one is dedicated to her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Yesterday in the House of Commons, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> what I thought was a very simple, non-partisan question. I asked when fully vaccinated seniors could give their grandchildren a hug. The answer we got back from the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>, a year into the pandemic, could be summarized like this: She does not know, is not sure she wants to tell us, and believes it is a provincial jurisdiction, but she will give the provinces advice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is not what Canadians want to hear. I think that answer encapsulates best the need for this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are a year into COVID‑19, and enough is enough. A year ago, Canadians from coast to coast pulled together to say we had to shut down the economy and undertake these restrictions in order to buy time for public health experts, all of us here in this place, provincial governments and municipal leaders to figure out what COVID‑19 was, how it spreads and who was most vulnerable, and to develop tools to permanently combat it, like therapeutics, rapid tests and vaccines. A year into the pandemic, those tools now exist. The problem is that in Canada, we have not had clear guidance from our health officials on the circumstances under which widespread mass lockdowns can safely end. That is a huge problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Those who are watching today need to understand that no level of government in Canada has issued any advice on what fully vaccinated people can do. The only thing the federal government has said to date, when asked, is that vaccinated people still have to go into controversial quarantine hotels. The federal government has to at least tell people what the plan is to develop benchmarks on how these tools are going to bring freedom, prosperity and normalcy back to the lives of Canadians. Today, we are calling on every member of this House to support the federal government in developing a plan within 20 days on the benchmarks by which these tools can be used in order to let life get back to normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We all acknowledge that it is important to combat the spread of COVID‑19, important to protect people from serious illness, important to prevent death. We have been doing that for the last year, all of us in this place. What is missing now is hope for the future. Canadians have no idea when lockdowns are going to end, and that has to stop. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why does that have to stop? It is not just me asking for this. We have Unifor asking for “a national recovery plan to include adapting border restrictions to safely reopen borders”. There is the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. The Tourism Industry Association of Canada has stated, “The news of COVID vaccine distribution gives us reason for cautious optimism”, but said that we need to plan for the recovery of Canada's tourism industry now. The Fitness Industry Council of Canada is asking for a plan. Mayors are asking for plans. Everybody is asking for a plan. It is not just stakeholders who are saying this; it is also medical experts who are saying, “We can't just live in a bubble and have a life of no risk. Everything we do has consequences.” We need a better path forward that uses these tools to protect Canadians' health while also ensuring that life gets back to normal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are stories from the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The federal government has to deliver this. Probably the most critical thing the federal government could do right now is deliver a plan with benchmarks on how lockdowns can be gradually, permanently and safely lifted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We do not have that. How can businesses plan to reopen if they do not know the circumstances under which they are going to do that? Can we imagine being a restaurant owner right now, when every day it says in the news that we might lock down again, or we might not?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Public Health officials have not even been clear on the data showing where transmission is occurring and whether we are applying these tools to the most vulnerable places. A lot of Canadians are saying that it seems like a lot of reactive measures and a lot of guesswork.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians have pulled together and Canadians have sacrificed a lot, but the federal government has to stop asking Canadians to sacrifice normal life. It has to stop asking people to sacrifice hugs, their mental health, their safety at home. It has to stop asking people to sacrifice those things, and it has to start giving them a plan for hope: “This is how we are going to reopen. These are the benchmarks. This is what we are using and this is how we are doing it.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Other countries around the world are already doing this. This week Iceland has said that if people are vaccinated, there is no quarantine for them, and they can just come on in. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has issued a reopening plan with benchmarks. Under the Biden administration in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the CDC have issued guidelines on what vaccinated persons can do. They have set an aspirational target of July 4, Independence Day in the U.S., and Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that the United States is going to have a normal Independence Day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why can we not have that here in Canada? Why can we not have nice things too? I want to re-emphasize that the federal government has not told Canadians what they can and cannot do if they have received a vaccine. It has not told airlines any sort of plan for safe border reopening. This cannot be a taboo topic anymore. The federal government is spending billions of dollars on lockdown restriction measures, so it has a responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All of the Liberals who stand up to talk to this motion today are going to say that it is not the federal government's job, that it is the job pf the provincial governments. There is a big problem with that. We are in an emergency crisis situation, and it is the federal government's job to lead because it is spending billions of dollars, money that we do not have, to support continued lockdown restrictions with no plan to end them. To refute their talking points, that is problem number one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Number two, <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has come out many times and asked for lockdown restrictions that are within provincial jurisdiction. On November 24, the Prime Minister said that the federal government is working with the provinces so that they can impose restrictions. He said that again on November 10 in a CTV article, and again in the Canadian Press on November 13. Those are just a few quotes from him that I pulled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Yesterday in the House of Commons, to that question that I referenced around hugs, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> said that the federal government is working with provinces and territories to develop guidance, with support from the federal government, on restrictions. The Liberals cannot suck and blow. They cannot say that it is politically convenient for them, ahead of a potential election that no one but the Liberals want, to offload this responsibility to the provincial governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To the bureaucrats who are watching this speech, if bureaucrats in Health Canada are advising the minister that it is not her job to provide guidance, why are we paying your salaries? If the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> is not asking her department, with its thousands of bureaucrats, for guidance on this, why are we paying your salaries? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We need hope. We are not saying that we should just willy-nilly do anything. What we are saying is that the federal government has to start issuing direction to the airlines, to hospitality and tourism, to retail, to marginalized communities, to women who are having domestic violence issues. We need this plan. It should be a no-brainer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The motion we have in front of the House of Commons today is asking for a data-driven plan. This is what the ask is. It is that the House “call on the government to table within 20 calendar days, following the adoption of this motion, a clear data-driven plan to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting COVID-19 restrictions.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I said I was dedicating this to my friend Lynne. Her husband passed away. She did not even get to see him when he went in for his heart attack. People should not have to say goodbye to their loved ones over FaceTime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The federal government needs a plan. Every person in this House and every Canadian should support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is truly amazing how the member has a consistent attitude, and I believe it is misleading, of providing false information. Is the member trying to indicate to those who are following this debate that the federal government is responsible for lifting lockdowns or restrictions? My understanding, according to the Constitution, is that the provinces are responsible. Canada is a vast country with many regions, and it is the provinces that put in the restrictions. </ParaText>

The federal government has been all over this. I ask members to think about how disgusting this is. After billions of dollars and thousands of bureaucrats, a year later the federal government is saying it is not its job. It is Legault's job, Doug Ford's job, or Jason Kenney's job. Liberals will not provide any support on this or any guidance. All they are going to do is have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> come out of Rideau Cottage and say, “Well, I think you should lock down more.” Then Liberal backbenchers will tweet stuff like that.

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I rise in the House today to speak to the opposition day motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Before I get into the specifics on economic recovery, I would like to take this time to reach out and thank the many members of all parties and Canadians at large who have supported me and my family through the passing of my son, Garrett Cumming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Garrett had an extraordinary life in his 35 years on this planet, and I am extraordinarily proud of him. Garrett was like many at-risk Canadians and spent the year very isolated. His struggles demonstrated the incredible importance of our work in this place and the importance of getting things back to normal as soon as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We must all recognize that there is no feasible way that we, as a country, can make any kind of significant recovery without addressing and conquering this health crisis. Small businesses will continue to flounder until they are forced to finally close their doors. New graduates who want to get a job will find applications unfilled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Single-parent households will have this $2,000 cheque, but they really want to get back to work to support their families. Sending out money as a crutch for individuals and businesses was needed to keep Canadians afloat, but it is simply not sustainable. We need to have strategies to plan and protect the compromised and get the economy back on track. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Spending to protect Canadians in the pandemic was the right thing to do and, frankly, Canada's Conservatives supported it, but we cannot pass unsustainable debt on to future generations. Once the recovery starts, we will need to get our spending under control and grow the economy. Only once we secure the health of Canadians will we be able to begin a meaningful talk on economic recovery, and the answer is not a lifetime of CERB cheques or government handouts, it is jobs. It is the dignity that comes with earning a paycheque. It is the freedom that comes from being able to control one's own finances at the moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians are experiencing a joblessness rate that is 40% worse than the G7 average. At 8.2%, this means that more than 1.3 million Canadians are not working and could be working. We need a plan to come out of COVID-19 to create jobs, get our economy back on track and allow people to earn those paycheques. We cannot keep on putting this on the national credit card. Only jobs will provide Canadians with personal financial security. Jobs allow them to have good child care, education, nutrition and recreation. Jobs produce tax revenue, which helps reduce the government debt and protects our cherished social safety net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canada's Conservatives are offering a path, one of security and certainty. It may not be that glamorous, but it will safely secure our future and deliver us to a Canada where those who have struggled the most through this pandemic can get back to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Integral not only to our build back, but equally as important to sustain our country's growth, are two metrics that I have been following over the past year: Canada's competitiveness and Canada's innovation. With a country of our size and the sparsity of population, there is no way we can rely just on our internal economy to lead us to recovery. Canada will need massive growth in exports to fuel any kind of recovery. Spending on infrastructure should be predominately focused on those things that improve productivity, competitiveness and access to markets. Private sector innovation is what will lead us into the future and provide us with the technology we need both to shift to global sustainability and reinstate us as a world economic leader. This will give the world what it wants, which is more Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom have both released public plans for their economic reopening, while Canadian officials have yet to give Canadians the clarity for when regular economic activity and social life will resume. The U.S. is our largest trading partner, yet over a year has passed and we still do not have a reopening strategy for the border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Carlo Dade, director of trade at the Canada West Foundation, said, “In 2019, the World Economic Forum's ranking of perception of quality of trade and reliability of trade infrastructure saw Canada drop 22 places...to 32nd in the globe.” Moreover, Canada has fallen out of the top 10 ranking of the world's most competitive economies, and we have fallen near the bottom of our peer group on innovation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Little interest has been shown in expanding trade in industries in which we have a strategic advantage given our abundance. There is little mention about mining, the forestry sector, the agricultural sector and the resource sector. These are sectors that have proven in the past to drive the economy and contribute significantly to our economic health. The world wants and needs more of our natural resources and we should think about expanding our market share, not hasten its decline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We need to stop scaring off investment like the government has done since 2015 and start encouraging it again. The most recent example is Chevron Canada, which stopped funding its Kitimat project. It is not surprising that it has had a difficult time trying to get someone to buy its interest in the project. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Instead of focusing on party platitudes, we need to get busy, help drive the recovery and get people back to work. If the government wants to focus on rebuilding the economy, it should consider some of the following. It should speed up approval of job-creating projects, large and small. The OECD ranks Canada 34th out of 35 countries for the amount of time it takes to obtain a permit for a new general construction project. All three levels of government have to participate in this. We need to be the quickest to build factories, shopping centres, business parks, mines and more. We should be removing, not adding, more regulatory burden. We should support the advancement of carbon capture technologies, unlock innovation in the technology sector, focus on the quantity and quality of R and D, and provide greater IP protection and policies that support retention in Canada, as well as have immigration policies that support the attraction of talent and, of course, we need greater access to offshore markets for our natural resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Economic recovery cannot be an Ottawa-knows-best approach where the government picks and chooses which jobs should be where, in which sector and which region. We can never recover if only the few get richer while working families get left behind. Specifically, I would recognize the government's failure when it comes to Canadians working in the tourism, airline and hospitality sectors, sectors that have been among the hardest hit. Conservatives would take immediate action in those sectors and get people back to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The tourism industry knows what needs to happen for us to head into a successful recovery. Across the board, stringent measures have already been implemented in an effort to assure that all tourism-related activities are safe, and it has communicated that to the public. It knows it has to build public confidence in travel and the risk perception surrounding it. That is going to determine the speed of this recovery. The Tourism Industry Association of Canada has said that “A plan to replace Canada’s current patchwork approach of reacting to daily numbers is overdue.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While the government neglected to come up with a plan to innovate in tourism and hospitality, we saw fantastic collaboration from the Canadian airlines and our world-class institutions to provide solutions as the now-defunct rapid testing pilot program. This was a great example of a private sector success, only to be shut down by the federal government. Ed Sims, the president and CEO of WestJet, stated, “Countries around the world have taken action to limit or defer costs to the aviation industry, yet our situation remains exacerbated by double-digit increases that are beyond our control.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>At the end of the day, the government has an entire tool box at its disposal. It has a spending account in excess of $700 billion; it has access to the most educated population on the planet; it has more land than it knows what to do with and resource potential beyond compare. It has absolutely everything it ever needs to get this country well on its way to recovery, like other countries who have much less have done. We need to look at the data and science when it comes to recovery, not what will make Liberals more electable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are too small a country to trade with just ourselves. We have the potential to lift Canadians economically in all corners of this great country and we have proven industries that can help us build back. Canadians are amazing innovators and innovation must be part of the solution, but not the only solution. Our country has an incredible amount of potential and we, as Canadians, can bounce back if the government allows it.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="272436" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to speak on the floor of the House of Commons virtually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I must say that I am a little bit disappointed. Here we have the first official opposition day and the Conservatives have a whole spectrum of things they could have chosen to talk about today. I was hoping they would have reflected on the past weekend and talked about climate change. I believe it would have been a great opportunity for the Conservative leadership and members to say something very simple that would be very important to all Canadians. It is not really that difficult to say that climate change is real. We recognize that the Conservative Party over the weekend denied that climate change is real. Members voted down the motion. I thought it would have been a wonderful, interesting debate to see Conservative member after Conservative member stand up and tell Canadians that climate change is not real, which we in the Liberal caucus and the Greens and New Democrats recognize as real. That is why I was hoping that we would talk about that today. It would have been a great platform for the Conservative Party to set the record straight on what their beliefs really are on this important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Having said that, there is no doubt that the number one issue in Canada has remained the same in the last 12 months. Our government's top priority, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has indicated day after day, is the health and safety of all Canadians from coast to coast to coast. That is why we continue to take scientific advice and use an evidence-based approach to fighting COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We indicated very clearly to Canadians that our goal was for Canadians to have free, safe and timely access to an effective vaccine. Due to the hard work of many, in particular our civil servants and the <Affiliation DbId="253382" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> working with the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, we have put Canada in a good position. We have the highest number of doses per capita of any country in the world and the most diverse portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines. We are starting to see the tangible benefits of that work in terms of a number of doses being delivered. It is an ever-increasing number. That, I believe, demonstrates very clearly that we have turned the corner and that there is hope, so that we can look forward to things like the federal budget that will be coming down the pipe in the not too distant future, and that we will see the defeat of the coronavirus. At the same time, we still have to be very cautious. We all have a role to play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With respect to the motion at hand, and after having an opportunity to ask a question, there are a number of thoughts that come to mind. The federal government does not have the constitutional authority that seems to be implied in what the Conservatives specifically want us to do. I posed that question to the mover of the motion. The Conservative Party, surely to goodness, understands provincial jurisdiction versus federal jurisdiction and who puts in the restrictions and the lockdowns. It is not Ottawa. That is provincial jurisdiction. We decided long ago, at the very beginning, that we were going to take a team Canada approach in dealing with the coronavirus, which meant that we were going to work with the stakeholders, in particular, our provinces, territories, indigenous leaders and so forth.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>In a country as vast as Canada, the circumstances and situations vary significantly. In fact, the last time I was in Ottawa, Manitoba, on a per capita basis, was the worst in the country when it came to COVID-19 and the battle was not going well in that province. It put in additional restrictions and because it did that, it made an impact. Today, we are doing relatively well. The people of Manitoba and the provincial government took actions to reverse the wave, to bring it down to a much more acceptable number. Ideally we would like to be back where we were in June and July, and hopefully we will achieve that in the not too distant future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Every day, if we listen to the local media, discussions take place about what should or should not be lifted and what Manitobans should be doing. Our situation is very different. We cannot say that what is happening in Manitoba is the very same as what is happening in Ontario, Nova Scotia or British Columbia. It varies. That is why we have constitutional authorities that reinforce the provincial jurisdictions and responsibilities of putting in these restrictions and are, in good part, for the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When I posed this question to the Conservative health critic, in her manner, she talked about travel restrictions. Just the other day, I asked a Conservative MP in the House if he supported the travel restrictions that were currently in place. He said, yes, that he supported them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What the Conservatives want is something I suspect a vast majority, if not all, provinces would object to, which is having the federal government dictating when restrictions would be lifted. We need to continue to work with provinces, listen to what science and our health experts tell us and continue to build upon the momentum that is having a positive impact in all our communities across our country. We can best do that by working with Canadians, which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done from day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When I say the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, I say that intentionally, because the previous speaker challenged the leadership of the Prime Minister of Canada. The member's response to a question was that the Prime Minister should show leadership and that leadership had been lacking. Nothing could be further from the truth. From day one, the Prime Minister has been in front of this issue, working with Canadians and stakeholders in general to try to come up with ways to minimize the negative impacts of the coronavirus. The Conservatives have been at times supportive, but most of the time at odds. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>As we continue to focus on the health and well-being of Canadians in developing policies and taking actions to support that, the Conservatives are looking under rocks, trying to find a scandal, or where money might have been spent that was inappropriate or trying to tarnish different aspects of the expenditures of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We saw that amplified during the months of June and July when the opposition had thousands of questions to ask. Did the Conservatives ask questions about the vaccine back then? Not that I can recall. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know Conservatives will ask me some questions. Maybe they can do a bit of research in-between. I would ask them this: How many questions did the Conservatives ask about vaccines back in June and July of 2020?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government, through the advisory committee, was aggressively looking at ways in which we could ensure we could acquire the vaccine from more than one company. That leadership was coming from our government. What leadership did the Conservatives have on the file? Then they get this brain wave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I can recall back in the fall when the Conservatives were talking about rapid testing and, oh my God, the world was falling apart or the sky was falling. The Conservatives were trying to give an impression that the federal government had dropped the ball because we did not have rapid testing. There were 25 million-plus rapid tests, I believe, and less than 1% were actually being used back in February. Many provinces were in the decimals, yet we would have thought that was the answer to everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government recognized that the best way to fight the coronavirus was to listen and follow the advice of science and health experts, to take a team Canada approach by working with provinces and territories, which are the bodies responsible for putting in the restrictions in their economies, and, most important from a national perspective, to have the backs of Canadians to ensure we were in a position to protect our economy. Having the backs of Canadians and protecting our economy puts us in a better position so that when the economy starts to reopen, when things get back to that new normal, Canada will be in a position to not only recover but to build back better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The first few years, we emphasized, and we continue to emphasize, the importance of Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. We have been trying to advance that very important initiative. We have not forgotten about it; we continue to work on that. We continue to work on economic measures so that when the time is right, we can see a healthier Canada, both physically and economically, where our society will be able to grow. That is one of the reasons why, for example, we have seen ongoing support toward trade agreements even though we have had to deal with the coronavirus. In other words, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, recognizing the importance of issues that have been emphasized through the pandemic. An example of that is supports for seniors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>All members of the Liberal caucus talk about how important it is that we support our seniors. We have seen that during the pandemic, we saw it pre-pandemic and we will see it post-pandemic too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Where we could improve and make it better, we will do that on issues like pharmacare. We in the government understand what our responsibilities are. For those following this debate, we take that very seriously. The government's actions to date clearly demonstrate this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is not to say we are perfect. There have been some mistakes. There have been opportunities for us, through our constituents, to see programs modified or changed, and understandably so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>From absolutely nothing, from no existence to up and running, we developed, through civil servants, the CERB program. That program served almost nine million Canadians. To me, that demonstrates very clearly the government's leadership in supporting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would challenge any Conservative member to indicate another government that has done as well in bringing forward a program to support a population. Out of nothing, we developed the CERB program that served almost nine million of our population of 37.6 million people. That is one of the ways in which we were there to support Canadians. That is leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We saw it with respect to supporting people with disabilities, seniors and students. Those types of programs, which were enhanced in some cases and brought into place in other cases, were there because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> indicated at the beginning that we would have the backs of Canadians, and we did. That was only a part of the plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I indicated earlier, we could talk about businesses. We could talk to our <Affiliation DbId="241633" Type="4">Minister of Small Business</Affiliation> or the former minister, who I knew quite well because I worked with her while she was government House leader. Small businesses are the backbone of Canada's economy and are absolutely essential to our future. Every member of the Liberal caucus will say that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We were there and we continue to be there for small businesses. We created the Canada emergency wage subsidy program. Millions of jobs were saved. Businesses might have closed had that program not been there. What about the rent subsidy program or the emergency business account program? We even have the credit availability program. There is the regional relief and recovery fund program. During the last wave, we talked about the lockdown support program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All these programs helped workers and supported small businesses. By supporting small businesses, we prevented many bankruptcies, I would suggest tens of thousands of bankruptcies, from taking place. That puts Canada in a much better position to recover. These types of things have been taking place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We will continue to work with provinces, territories, indigenous leaders and other Canadians to ensure we continue to move forward on the right track.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, what is important is that with this government in recent years, we have seen more health care dollars transferred to provinces than by any other federal government. It is historically the highest amount of health care dollars ever transferred to them, but as my friend can appreciate, there is also a need for national standards in things like home care services and that Ottawa should not just be seen as an ATM for handing out money. We should be listening to what our constituents are saying on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would hope that the Bloc would see what the Conservatives are trying to do with the motion. What are his thoughts about the Conservatives wanting us to tell the provinces to start lifting restrictions? Does he support that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I think the Liberal government loves provincial jurisdiction now as a reason not to do anything. Revera is a company that is owned by the federal government. Revera is a for-profit long-term care home, but the Liberals say that we have to have standards and they talk about getting profit out, but then when it is about doing something, they immediately say it is provincial jurisdiction so they cannot that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the government has taken the initiative to ensure there is additional sick time given. I would encourage individuals who have “cousins”, politically speaking, in other provinces to encourage their provincial bodies to also do what Ottawa is doing, because the vast majority of workers in our communities fall under provincial jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As we have moved forward on this issue, it would be nice for us to see greater co-operation. That is really what Canadians want and something that we have been doing.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, when I look at the current warnings, I appreciate that it is frustrating to be told by the federal government that it is a provincial jurisdiction, but here I am looking at what our public health officer for British Columbia is saying. according to a CBC story that was updated several hours ago. Dr. Bonnie Henry is again saying that we should not gather indoors at all, but that up to 10 people might be able to gather outside. The B.1.1.7 variant is more transmissible and, in the words of Dr. Bonnie Henry, the risk “for all of us remains high.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am having trouble with the motion before us today, not because of jurisdictional issues, but because I wonder how the government could implement a plan within 20 days, and there is no mention of benchmarks in the wording of this motion for a clear, data-driven plan.

Canada has the largest numbers of doses per capita of any country in the world. If we look at the numbers, I believe they are very encouraging. By the end of this month, we will have eight million doses. That is a rapidly growing number. We are in a very good position to ensure that those who want it will be able to get that vaccine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I will then resume my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was talking about the article by journalist Joël‑Denis Bellavance in today's La Presse newspaper. According to the article, there is a document circulating internally among deputy ministers and within the government to remind everyone what a fiscal imbalance is. It also explains just how unsustainable the financial situation facing the provinces is and that a solution absolutely must be found. This confirms what the Conference Board of Canada, the Council of the Federation and the Parliamentary Budget Officer have been saying. Year after year, the PBO publishes a fiscal sustainability report reminding us that the provinces are facing an untenable situation. This is primarily due to the underfunding of health care by the federal government in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The deputy government House leader said that the government has never spent so much on health, as if the problem were resolved, even though the opposite is circulating within his government. He said that Canada-wide standards are needed. That is tantamount to federal encroachment into Quebec and provincial jurisdictions. Not only is the government maintaining its underfunding, but it is also interfering in provincial jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me relate that to the motion we are debating today. The motion calls for a reopening plan. Back home, the Government of Quebec is in charge of health measures as well as the lockdown and reopening measures. These measures are debated at the National Assembly of Quebec and supported by Quebec public health. Decisions are based on scientific studies and analyses. That is how to do things. I really do not see how Ottawa has anything to do with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government, the Liberal Party, is interfering by not fulfilling its role to properly fund health. The Conservative party is also interfering. The trend is to constantly interfere in other people's business and take over. The government misinterpreted its role during the pandemic on many fronts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the discussions over the previous speech by the Liberal member, an NDP member also said that interference is always used as an excuse for inaction, in other words, it is a good thing that Ottawa is interfering. The NDP always proposes those sorts of measures. Even my esteemed colleague from the Green Party said that although she is against the measure it is not because of interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If we exclude the Bloc Québécois, there is a sort of unanimity in the House about Ottawa having to interfere in jurisdictions, especially in the health sector. I find that completely unacceptable. The motion we are debating today is about health. Ottawa's primary role is to properly fund health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is clear from opinion polls and from speaking to people on the street that Canadians are asking that health care be adequately funded. Although Ottawa is many years behind in this regard, that has to change. This is a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Implementing a reopening plan is a decision that must be made by Quebec City, by Toronto, by the Government of Alberta and by every province. We must respect jurisdictions. In the House, we must deal with Ottawa's areas of jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am certain that my colleague, who will be speaking after me, will talk about how the border and airports were managed. These are areas under federal jurisdiction. It has been a fiasco. The Liberal member spoke about the record number of doses of vaccines per capita that Canada has. I say bravo, that is very good, but can we get them in a reasonable period of time? Canada is truly behind compared to other countries, and that is unacceptable. I am not surprised, but, once again, I am very disappointed to see the approach and the actions of the other parties in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will come back to the motion to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting COVID-19 restrictions. I am sorry, but, according to public health authorities, we could unfortunately be facing a third wave very soon.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>It makes no sense to permanently lift restrictions. We need to be practical and rely on the science. These measures are not taken lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government and the House can introduce good economic measures to get us through the pandemic. There are two aspects to the Bloc Québécois's approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>During the pandemic, certain measures are needed to support people, businesses and organizations that are struggling. Since political parties are not struggling, they should not have had access to the wage subsidy. That was not stipulated in the act, and they should return this money immediately. The businesses and people who faced hardship need measures to help them through the economic crisis caused by this pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is simple. We are calling for the support measures to be extended for the duration of the crisis, especially for the sectors that will experience long-term impacts from the pandemic. It is very important that the government commit to such support. We hope to see it and we demand to see it in the budget, which is long overdue, I might add. In addition, these measures must reflect reality. They must be targeted. These measures should not be like others we have seen in recent months that encourage people to stay home instead of returning to work once proper safety measures have been implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We must also provide support for industries. I am thinking in particular of the cultural industry, for example, festivals, and of the hotel and restaurant industries, because they have been affected in more lasting ways. We need to support them until the crisis is over. We also need plans for targeted support for certain industries, such as the aerospace industry, which has been hard hit by the public health restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why has Canada still not unveiled a targeted plan for these industries? That is very important. We are waiting and we hope that such a plan will be included in the upcoming budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am almost out of time because of technical problems with the interpretation. I will therefore pick up the pace so that, in the minute I have left, I can at least list the subjects that I wanted to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The measures were extended during the pandemic, and now we are calling for a recovery plan that will help stimulate the economy and launch the industries of tomorrow that we believe in. Obviously, I am talking about the green economy and strong sectors. I spoke about the aerospace industry, but we also think it is important to have a strong pharmaceutical industry. Let us regain that expertise.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>After we were told that vaccination was a month behind schedule, what was the economic and social cost of that? That kind of delay has major repercussions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the motion may imply that, but that is not the only thing it implies. It is basically Quebec's and the provinces' job, and their respective public health authorities and legislative assemblies, “to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting COVID‑19 restrictions”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I hate the fact that the Conservative Party campaigns on respecting jurisdictions and giving the provinces a lot of autonomy and then, when it comes down to it, they show up today with a motion where that is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When I introduced the bill on a single tax return in Quebec, the Conservatives said they were in favour of it and that they would move a motion in the House. When it came time to vote, they abstained. The Bloc Québécois finds this approach by the Conservatives to be rather disappointing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the Bloc Québécois and the people of Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I must say that there are a number of worthwhile points in the Conservatives' motion. It is true that the COVID‑19 restrictions have had serious economic and mental health impacts on Canadians and Quebeckers. Governments around the world, in Quebec, in Canada, in the United States and in the United Kingdom had no choice but to implement increasingly severe restrictions to protect people from the spread of COVID‑19. Some of the restrictions were questionable, but the majority of them were necessary. I am absolutely not trying to defend the government; I am simply trying to put things in perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Yes, COVID‑19 has had and continues to have some serious economic and mental health impacts. I read something on Twitter yesterday that really stuck with me. Jean‑Marc Léger, an economist and the founding president of Quebec polling firm Leger, said, “The 1st wave was a health crisis and seniors were hardest hit. The 2nd wave was an economic crisis and companies, businesses and workers were hardest hit. The 3rd wave is a mental health crisis and young people are being hardest hit.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>He was referring to an article in Time about the deterioration of the mental health of youth in the United States. We can say that the situation is similar in Canada. According to one poll, psychological distress among young people 18 to 34 is greater than in other age groups. The social and emotional development of youth and the establishment of romantic relationships results from socialization with their peers. Restrictions that were designed to reduce gatherings, for example, have had a significant impact on youth. Experts say that the mental health of youth was already an issue before the pandemic. Today, 26% of millennials say they have suffered from depression. That is a very high percentage. There is a lot of talk about the economic cost of this pandemic, but, unfortunately, there will also be an extremely high cost in terms of mental health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not the focus of my speech today because, as we know, health is a provincial jurisdiction. Quebec has everything at hand to efficiently manage its health system. All that is missing is the federal government's financial assistance, which it is still waiting for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Certainly, governments had to respond to COVID‑19 and rapidly institute temporary restrictions. These restrictions are temporary, not permanent, and that is an important distinction. Although some are more drastic than others, these measures are in place for a reason. As the motion states, the temporary measures were put in place primarily to alleviate pressure on health care systems. I think it is premature to lift some of those restrictions before the crisis is under control. The Conservative motion specifically targets restrictions in areas of federal competency, such as air travel and border restrictions. It calls for a clear, data-driven plan to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting these restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Thinking about lifting these restrictions makes me think of when they were put in place not that long ago. Today I would like to share with the House some particularly interesting tidbits I read in a very relevant book by the journalist Alec Castonguay entitled <I>Le Printemps le plus long: au cœur des batailles politiques contre la COVID‑19</I>, a behind-the-scenes look at the politics of fighting COVID‑19. The author interviewed dozens of key actors, politicians, bureaucrats and scientists who played a role in managing the crisis in Quebec and Canada. I learned a lot of things that are probably already public knowledge, but that I feel it is appropriate to mention here and now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First of all, I was surprised to learn that the Global Public Health Intelligence Network did not detect any signals of the emergence of the COVID-19 virus in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. GPHIN, which is a unit of the Public Health Agency of Canada, acts like a smoke detector and was created in the late 1990s so that countries would not be taken by surprise by new fatal viruses, particularly following the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was surprised because, over the years, GPHIN had become the main early warning system for emerging infectious diseases for 85 countries. Normally, the World Health Organization relies on GPHIN for approximately 20% of its reports of new viruses in the world every year. That is quite a lot. However, in the case of COVID-19, GPHIN was apparently unable to sound the alarm earlier, mostly because of a lack of staff and funding. In fact, it seems that GPHIN's role was called into question by Stephen Harper's Conservative government in 2014 and that, since then, the work of its scientists has been valued less highly. Unfortunately, the arrival of a Liberal government in 2015 did nothing to change that. GPHIN scientists stopped issuing alerts in May 2019, seven months before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China. Even the Minister of Health said that she did not know that GPHIN had ceased normal operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I may be droning on a bit about this, but I do have a point to make.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Scientists have been predicting a pandemic for decades, but we were not ready. The federal government was clearly not ready. The cuts to health care obviously did not help. One of the most overlooked aspects was the procurement of personal protective equipment, but that is a subject for another day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>According to the book, the Liberal cabinet first learned about the existence of the Chinese virus on January 18, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me briefly lay out the timeline of events. The WHO declared an international public health emergency a few days later, on January 30. As Mr. Castonguay put it, the alarm went off, but no one woke up. In late February 2020, Canadians returning from all over the world—not necessarily from China—began bringing the virus home to Canada. While public health experts around the world believed that all suspected travellers should be tested, not just those returning from China, the Public Health Agency of Canada maintained its risk level in Canada at “low”. With the exception of travel to China, Global Affairs Canada was not discouraging Canadians from leaving the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On March 11, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. On March 16, a team from the Government of Quebec and Montreal public health went to the Montreal-Trudeau airport to inform travellers, since, strangely enough, the federal government had yet to put strict screening and information measures in place. Let us not forget that the government had been aware of the virus for two months by then. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Between March 1 and March 21, 42,000 foreign travellers and nearly 250,000 Canadians arrived at the Montreal-Trudeau airport from all over the world, including several countries that had major outbreaks. <Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText>In addition, 157,000 Quebeckers returned home by land, and nearly 37,000 Americans drove in from especially hard-hit states, including New York and Massachusetts. Travellers brought back nearly 250 different strains of the virus to Quebec alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Looking back, it is clear that a travel ban should have been instituted in mid-February in order to have an impact on transmission. Canada had just a few cases at the time, and Quebec did not have any. We know that it would have been hard for the government to justify such a measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Could we have done better with the little information available to us? That is a good question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Border restrictions could certainly have been implemented more quickly. I am convinced that more could have been done, and more quickly, whether it was checking travellers' temperature, requiring rapid tests before boarding, or banning non-essential travel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There was a delay between the time when GPHIN and the Public Health Agency of Canada started to become increasingly concerned and the time when the Liberal government finally decided to act. Had there not been this delay, things could have been very different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Delaying traveller screening may possibly have allowed the variants to spread more easily within our borders. This recent experience has shown us that it is never too early to make plans to better prepare for the future. However, as we enter the third wave of the virus, lifting restrictions appears to be premature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Right now, vaccination is the best way to get out of this pandemic. Until the majority of Canadians and Quebeckers are vaccinated, it would be completely irresponsible to allow people to travel freely again. Vaccinations are finally happening, but there have been delays.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If the Liberal government had been more proactive, it would not have waited until June to create a vaccine task force. Because the government failed to be proactive, no vaccines will be manufactured here until the end of the year and, more importantly, Canada is fully reliant on foreign manufacturers for its vaccine supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I appreciate the Conservatives' motion and sincerely believe that the government must present some kind of plan for getting out of this crisis. I honestly do not think the government has had a plan all along. The government is acting blindly and focusing more on its election platform than on getting us out of this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, before suggesting that the temporary COVID‑19 restrictions be lifted, both the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party should take the time to look back and admit that measures were too slow to be implemented and that if the government had acted more quickly, we could have saved thousands of lives. This is about lives lost. Just a few days ago, we paid tribute to the more than 22,000 lives lost, including 10,000 in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I think that we have a short memory. We know that the financial and mental health consequences are enormous, but we have to remember that these measures are in place to protect our people's health and safety. I think that is what matters most during a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There were definitely problems with the mandatory hotel quarantine, but we must remember that, before and during the holidays, the government was unable to make sure that returning travellers were actually quarantining. With variants surfacing around the world, I think self-isolating for 14 days upon arrival is still essential. The same goes for land border restrictions. People who do not have an essential reason to travel should stay home. That is part of the effort we must all make to combat this accursed virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government could certainly be more understanding and more flexible in some situations, such as family reunification or if a person has proof of vaccination. However, given that managing travellers and borders was such a mess from the start, I feel it is all the more urgent that everything be in order before we consider lifting restrictions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Today we are voting on the motion moved yesterday by the NDP. I am in favour of the motion, which seeks to protect seniors in long-term care centres. Now is not the time to blame other jurisdictions, but the fact is that Quebec has the worst record when it comes to the number of seniors who died at long-term care centres. It is a tragedy, but it is not the government's fault. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, I think that at a time of crisis, we must find ways to work together. Maybe we should stop focusing on borders and find a way to collaborate. Does my colleague think that it is possible to vote in favour of that motion while protecting provincial jurisdictions and the rights of Quebec?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>What happened in Quebec's long-term care centres was indeed a tragedy, and that is what Mr. Castonguay says in his book.

              <ParaText>However, Quebec has a health care system that has all of the tools it needs to operate properly, and Quebec is trying to keep it operating properly, but federal funding is needed. I understand and share my colleague's interest in collaboration. However, the way the federal government can help Quebec manage long-term care centres is to immediately transfer funding to it, as the premiers of Quebec and the provinces and territories, as well as the Bloc Québécois, have been asking it to do for weeks, if not months. That is how the federal government can really help Quebec's long-term care centres.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>There has been incredibly beautiful weather in Ontario this week, and I see people out on the streets wanting to believe this nightmare is over. When I was in the market the other night, I saw many young people doing what young people do, hanging out and talking, believing that with leaving winter behind, so too have we left behind the nightmare of COVID, but that is not the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know there are some very concerning new variants. The B.1.1.7 variant is spreading quickly across Canada. We are seeing multiple new cases and health organizations are telling us that this is putting us at the beginning of a third wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The crisis of new virulent variants hitting communities across this country happens as we are struggling to get the vaccine rollout. This is a race against time. The United Kingdom has 44 doses administered per 100 people. The United States has 37 doses per 100 people, and Canada is still down at 10 doses administered per 100 people. This is about the decisions that were made and the decisions that are being made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>My hon. colleagues in the Conservative Party were talking this morning about when the border will be opened. On the weekend, they said they did not believe in climate change. Maybe they do not believe in the new variants and that we should open border. We cannot open the border until we get the issue with the vaccines dealt with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The issue with the vaccines, of course, comes down to the decision made by the government to trust that the private sector would get them through this. The Americans made the decision to invest heavily in vaccine production and research. We did not do that in Canada, and it has put us in a situation where we are behind. We are behind at a time when we cannot afford it because of these variants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Reopening the economy is incredibly important because we know it has caused massive damage to small businesses and personal economies across this country, but we need to look at how the lack of rights that exist for many workers has exacerbated the crisis. Right now in Peel, there is a situation where 600 cases of COVID have been found at the Amazon warehouse. That is 600 cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not a flu we are talking about. It has been proven that COVID can have long-term neurological and health damage to people, yet Amazon allowed 600 of its workers to get sick in that plant. It is a number that I do not think has been as staggering anywhere, except at the Cargill plant in High River, where there was also about 600 cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Families are affected in Peel, which is continually in the red zone. We heard Doug Ford make it seem like the people in Peel were out partying and not listening to the rules, when the reason Peel has such high rates is because so many people are precarious workers. They work in warehouses like Amazon where they have no choice but to go to work. If we are going to talk about getting the economy reopened, we have to talk about protecting the workers who have been on the front lines and cannot take a day off if they feel sick. There is evidence of people who cannot even get a vaccine because they cannot afford to take a day off work. That is how precarious their situations are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Ontario, 15,000 people have gotten sick with COVID because of workplace exposures. There needs to be coherence in saying that to get the economy back on track, we have to shut down this COVID spread in workplaces. To do that, people have to have basic rights to have safe workplaces, and if they need time off when they are sick, they can take time off so they do not make other people sick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The issue of Amazon is something to look at because Amazon is the symbol of everything that is wrong in the modern globalized economy. This is a company with 21st century technology and 19th century labour practices. The abuses of workers at Amazon have been documented again and again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, I will ask members to remember when all of the Liberals were talking about team Canada, with all hands on deck and that we are all in this together. At that moment, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shocked the country when he said who the partners would be for distributing medical equipment. It was not Canada Post or Purolator, places that have unions and good working conditions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>No, we were going to partner with Jeff Bezos, one of the crummiest human beings on the planet, and make him our partner. What the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> effectively did was privatize and outsource to Amazon a key element of the pandemic response, and it is not just that Amazon is a crappy company in the way it treats its workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>While our small businesses were going down in flames across this country, Amazon was literally making out like bandits. Why was that? It is because Amazon does not pay taxes the way small businesses pay taxes. We would have thought the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would have seen what a symbol it would have been to stand beside small business owners across the country, compared with standing beside Jeff Bezos, who has a massive tax loophole that has allowed him to become billions of dollars richer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Two of the worst companies in terms of the profits they made were Amazon and Walmart. They are now $116 billion richer. Amazon and Walmart, by the way, were also two of the companies that gave the least to their employees. There are many big, big corporations whose executives actually said, “Hey, our employees are keeping us profitable. Our employees are going to get a better share.” Costco, certainly a big, big player, gave a fair share, but not Amazon and not Walmart. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why do I mention that? I mention it because we know that Walmart stayed open through the whole pandemic while all our little, small-town stores and businesses were hanging by a thread, and the owners were begging for loans because their businesses had to be shut. It is about that inequity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is also about the choice that this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made to tie himself to Amazon, of all companies, with the abuse of its workers and high injury rates, and the fact that we knew it was not going to protect its workers from COVID. We saw Tim Bray, vice-president of Amazon, quit over the firing of workers in the United States. A vice-president of Amazon quit because workers were fired for asking, in a pandemic, to expand sick leave, hazard pay and child care for the warehouse workers who were trying to keep the business afloat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The issue of child care was huge because, in the first wave when children had to stay home, workers had to continue to go in, as there was no support for them. The Prime Minister decided that Amazon was the symbol of what was going to make the Liberal government look good in the pandemic. It sent a very wrong message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What do we need to do? We need to work together at this point to get us through this third wave. I encourage people across this country not to let their guard down. This is the most dangerous point. We have come through two waves. In this third wave, we do not want to have ourselves hit again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We need the government to have a plan for the vaccine rollout. It has been hiding again and again behind provincial jurisdiction. We saw how the United States brought the army in, and how it had a national strategy to get the vaccines out. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is mister laissez-faire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I mean no offence to the provinces, but Doug Ford failed the people of Ontario time and time again in not spending the money he should have spent. Regarding Jason Kenney, when everyone else in Alberta was doing their part, his MLAs were on the beaches in Mexico and Hawaii. Now he is using his $30-million war room to pick a fight over the historical accuracy of a cartoon about Bigfoot. Jason Kenney thinks the biggest priority now is that a cartoon about Bigfoot is somehow inaccurate. I know there are a lot of Bigfoots that probably do support Jason Kenney.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am mentioning Jason Kenney and Doug Ford because we cannot simply leave something as big as a pandemic to them, if that is what their priorities are. We need leadership from the federal government, and we are not seeing it. We need a commitment at the federal level, where we have 180,000 employees, to have the Labour Code say that workers will be able to take time off for sick leave. That is a simple change the Liberal government could make now. If the Liberals did that, it would keep people safe. It would get the economy back up and rolling because we know that if people can take time off when they are sick, they are not going to make other people sick, and it will save us in the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, I am encouraging my Liberal colleagues and my Conservative colleagues to push for this simple change that we can do at the federal level to make sure that the workers who need to take time off, and we have hundreds of thousands of them under the federal jurisdiction, can actually get the time off. This is so they are not spreading COVID or any of its variants.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The problems we are facing right now are the new variants and the struggles we are still having with the vaccine rollout. Because of these, we cannot reassure Canadians of when we are going to be safe. We need to take a number of steps to get people to be safe, because restarting this economy is crucial. We cannot allow a third wave to happen. People are just so frustrated, so tired and have carried a heavy weight.</ParaText>

We do need a statement, but we also need to recognize that until we have the vaccines to deal with the variants, we are dealing with a very unsure situation for Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would like to start my remarks by outlining a few key principles I think are important for all parliamentarians to keep in mind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>One, all federal COVID-19 guidance must be based on the best available science and reflect both the state of the pandemic and the pace of the vaccine rollout across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Two, Canada's New Democrats understand that there is no trade-off to be made between saving lives and livelihoods. We know that we will not be able to get the economy back on track until we bring COVID-19 fully under control, and not the other way around. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Three, the federal government should provide Canadians with a clear path forward by releasing a comprehensive plan to put this pandemic behind us and begin the process of recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Four, we think that the federal government should not wait until the pandemic is over to begin acting on critical lessons that we have already learned. As one example, the NDP believes it is time to bring in paid sick leave for every Canadian worker, national standards for long-term care, and a public vaccine and drug manufacturer. These are gaping holes in Canada's economic and health care fabric that we know need to be fixed. There is no reason to wait to get started on those issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>While planning is always good, we must not prematurely ease essential measures that are critical to keeping Canadians safe. I will outline some of the major reasons why this is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, with the continued increase in variants of concern, maintaining public health measures and individual precautions is crucial to reducing infection rates and avoiding a rapid reacceleration of the epidemic and its severe outcomes, including hospitalization and deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The B.1.1.7 variant of concern, the one that was first identified in the U.K., is spreading quickly across Canada as we debate this today, causing doctors and experts to sound the alarm about a third wave of COVID-19 infections. Provinces have been easing restrictions after cases began to fall across the country in late January, and then the B.1.1.7 variant began spreading in earnest in mid-February.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia are each reporting more than 1,000 cumulative B.1.1.7 variant cases as of March 22. In fact, cumulatively, across Canada, we have 4,861 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant reported now. In addition, we have 244 cases reported across Canada of the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa. Finally, we have 104 cases reported across Canada of the P.1 variant first identified in Brazil. Therefore, we have an increasing spread of variants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Second, we are clearly entering a third wave. The Ontario Hospital Association issued a stark warning on March 15, saying that the province has now entered into a third wave, citing a sharp increase in cases of new variants of concern and rising admissions to intensive care units. Just days ago the Ontario Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, confirmed that the province is now in the midst of a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Ontario, variants of concern cases now exceed 50% of all cases. Here in B.C., on March 22, B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, confirmed that this province is experiencing a third wave of COVID-19 infection. She pointed to an increase in the seven-day rolling average of new daily cases over the last several weeks as an indication that this is B.C.'s third wave. Finally, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, nationally, COVID-19 activity levelled off at a high level since mid-February and that average daily case counts are now on the rise. The latest national level data show a seven-day average of 3,297 new cases daily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Third, we have to look at the pace of the vaccine rollout. As of March 22, the United Kingdom has administered 44 doses per 100 people, with 3.3% of its population fully vaccinated. In the United States, 37 doses have been administered per 100 people, with 13.2% of the population fully vaccinated. Contrast that to Canada, where we have administered 10 doses per 100 people, with only 1.7% of our population fully vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Fourth, if we compare strategies, in the coming weeks, the Biden administration in the U.S. will make every adult in the U.S. eligible for vaccination no later than May 1. Once all Americans are eligible to be vaccinated, the administration will ensure that every adult is actually able to get the vaccine by increasing the number of places Americans can get vaccinated, increasing the number of people providing vaccinations, providing tools to make it easier for individuals to find a vaccine and providing clear guidance to vaccinated Americans. The U.S. is also helping educators get vaccinated. The president has challenged all 50 states to get pre-K to 12 school staff and child care workers their first shot by the end of this month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the U.K., they have a similar strategy. The speed at which England will exit lockdown is set against four key tests: how the vaccine rollout is going, how vaccines are affecting hospitalizations and deaths, measuring infection rates and ensuring they are staying low, and ensuring that new variants are not undermining the other three criteria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>What do validators say about the state of affairs right now? Well, a joint statement by the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization states that “At face value there is a trade-off to make: either save lives or save livelihoods. This is a false dilemma – getting the virus under control is, if anything, a prerequisite to saving livelihoods”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is mirrored by many people across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Tyler Shandro, Alberta's health minister, has said said, “There will be no easing of any restrictions at this time. This is the safe move. It's the smart move to make for our province right now and it's absolutely necessary to help us avoid a third wave that would take more lives and once again put more pressure on the hospital system.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Dr. Peter Juni, scientific director of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, has said that “It’s the presence of cases caused by new variants that’s alarming.... [The] curve has gone upwards and upwards. It's skyrocketing at the moment.... What we need to do is, we need go harder.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Quebec Premier, Francois Legault, has said that “We look at what's happening in Ontario, in New York, in New Jersey and France and we have to worry. We have to be careful”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Finally, Dr. Caroline Colijn, Canada 150 research chair at Simon Fraser University, has said that “We’re probably not going to win the race between vaccination and the B.1.1.7 variant and partly that’s because it’s here now, it’s already established and rising and it has a higher transmission rate, which makes it harder to control and so I think that’s the concern over the next few months.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Colleagues, what I am saying is that we cannot prematurely exit at this point in time. We have to keep the existing measures in place, we have to deepen them, and now is not the time to premature exit from these very measures that, if we do not continue, would cost more lives and would increase the rate of transmission that we have worked so hard to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will pause for a minute and talk about paid sick leave in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>A large proportion of COVID-19 transmission has occurred in workplaces in part because workers do not have access to paid sick leave. We know that some jurisdictions, like B.C. and Yukon, have stepped in to provide additional support, but we also know that this support is not available to every worker in the country. Canada's New Democrats are calling on the Liberal government to fix the flaws in its current program to make it easier for people to access the program and get help more quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to move that the motion be amended by adding the following after a semi-colon: and that in order to facilitate this lifting of restrictions, this plan ensure that every Canadian worker has access to 10 paid sick days, starting by amending the Canada Labour Code to include 10 paid sick days for all federal workers.</ParaText>

The Canada Health Act establishes standards. That is the basis of our entire health care system, of which the people of Quebec, I am sure, are very proud and count on. The Canada Health Act sets out five principles, including portability, accessibility, universality, public administration, etc. and those standards must be met in order for the health transfer to be received by the Province fo Quebec and every other province and territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I fail to understand why the Bloc Québécois members rail against standards when the whole basis of our system is predicated on Quebec's meeting those standards. They want the money coming from the Canada health transfer, which I agree with my Bloc Québécois colleagues that it has to be increased. However, that is only the case if Quebec meets the standards set in the Canada Health Act. New Democrats simply want to expand our system using the same model that has been so successful and cherished by so many Canadians.</ParaText>

What is the importance of that? The government continues to say that it has already put that in action, but it is not working and Canadians are asking for it to be different.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the problem is deep: 58% of all workers in Canada do not have access to paid sick leave, and that jumps to 70% for low-wage workers. Only about 10% of companies increased their paid leave policies in response to COVID. The CRSB, which the Liberal government brought in, does not provide immediate accessible paid sick leave. It pays less than a full-time minimum wage job does in most provinces. Of course, that policy excludes some essential workers, such as migrant workers. It is time to stop this patchwork approach and make sure that every worker in this country has access to 10 paid sick leave—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is an honour to speak to our Conservative opposition day motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I struggled a lot with what I was going to say in this 10-minutes speech. The reality is that I probably have had enough experience over the last year and, indeed, the last three decades dealing with mental health and the challenges our most vulnerable communities deal with to probably fill an hour or even more with respect to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>COVID‑19 has really shone the light on and amplified a national crisis, and that is the mental health crisis. I know I am not unique with this experience and that my colleagues from all sides of the House are feeling it themselves and are hearing this every day in their offices that Canadians are struggling, now more than ever. We need our government to lead. Canadians need hope. They need to know their government has a plan for recovery. We cannot have a plan for recovery without a mental health plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A mental health action plan is critical, now more than ever. Over 20% of Canadians are feeling more anxiety, more depression. We know that substance use and abuse, whether related to alcohol, tobacco or drugs, is up over the last year. Domestic violence is up over the last year. Calls to crisis lines and women's shelters have gone through the roof. We need to do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was heartened last week when our leader detailed our five pillars for an elected Conservative government. The third pillar was putting forward a strong, mental health focused action plan for Canadians. As we move forward, the mental health and well-being of our nation must be at the heart of everything we do. There is no health without mental health. We need to view mental health the same as we view physical health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I remember when a firefighter contacted me some time ago. He asked me why he had to become a statistic before anyone cared. I asked him to explain. He said that if he had a broken arm, or leg, or back or even had the flu, his colleagues would come around and would ask if there was anything he needed. He said that the brotherhood and sisterhood of first responders falls short when it comes to mental injury and mental illness. That is true with most Canadians. That alone fuels the stigma surrounding mental illness and mental injury. It is the unseen illness, the unseen injury, that Canadians are facing, and had been facing leading up to COVID, which has made it even worse. Sadly, all we have seen from the Liberal government is no plan, no hope and a website.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Yesterday, in question period, I asked the minister where the plan was to implement the simple three digit 988 national suicide prevention hotline. Instead, she doubled down on the website. When I am sitting with family members who have been left behind due to death by suicide, or those who have contemplated suicide or those who are struggling, I hear what I call the “if only” conversations: “If only I saw the signs.” “If only I knew that my brother, my father, my husband or my wife was struggling, I could have done something.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Not once have I heard “If only there were as a website I could log onto or my loved one could log onto.” When I am talking to national organizations or grassroots organizations charged with delivering such critical care to the most vulnerable on the streets, whether it is with the opioid or homelessness crisis, they never talk about if only there were a government website they could go to. They talk about their concern of not knowing whether they will be able to keep their doors open. For addicts who come through their doors and finally say that they want and need help, they want to be able to put those people in beds and get them the help they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A real plan is exactly what we started to see with our leader last week when he announced our five pillars. The third pillar is so important, a real mental health plan, working with the provinces—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252897" Type="2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</Affiliation>, a great colleague. I probably should have announced this earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The plan our leader announced can be transformative. We will increase funding to the provinces and work with them on a mental health action plan. We will lead, not obfuscate, not push it aside and say that it is not our problem. We will implement the 988 national suicide prevention hotline. We will work with employers to incentivize them to provide adequate mental health support for their employees. It is so important to actually have a mental health action plan, now more than ever. An elected Conservative government will do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>An elected Conservative government will put mental health at the heart of everything we do. It was our former Conservative government that launched the Mental Health Commission. In opposition, it was a newly elected Conservative MP who launched legislation that called on the government to develop the first-ever national framework for combatting post-traumatic stress disorder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have to be better. I have stood in the House and talked about this time and again. In our first emergency debate, we talked about the suicide epidemic in first nations communities, specifically Attawapiskat. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> speaks so eloquently on this topic. One of our colleagues stood and said that he remembered that one of their first emergency debates 10 years ago was about the suicide epidemic in first nations communities. Sadly, we have not really moved beyond that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have stood in the House time and again and challenged our colleagues. For me, this is not a partisan issue; it is all our issue in being true leaders in the House. Our Conservative motion today calls on the government to show us the plan, to create hope for Canadians and to help those who are struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Last month, a lady in my riding, Margaret Sweder, celebrated her 100th birthday. I called her and wished her a happy birthday. I do not know her. First, she was not going to answer the phone because she thought it was a CRA fraud call, because the number was from Ottawa, but then we talked. I asked her what she was missing most in this COVID pandemic and she said “a hug.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on a very timely motion moved by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>. Today I speak on behalf of my constituents of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, and as the official opposition shadow minister for agri-food and agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My office has received hundreds of calls and emails from constituents who feel abandoned by the Liberal government. Their concerns, interests and livelihoods have been sacrificed by waves of lockdowns. Canadians watch as countries around the world are safely reopening without seeing an end in sight to the heavy-handed restrictions we have here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How much longer will Canadians have to wait to access COVID-19 immunizations? They need a concrete plan from the Liberal government on when and how COVID-19 restrictions will finally be safely and permanently lifted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One year ago, on a public health directive, the federal government began locking down public places, the U.S.-Canada border, airlines, businesses, restaurants, schools, hospitals, assisted living and extended nursing facilities, churches and even family homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have seen the consequences for businesses and people's livelihoods. These include cross-border tourism business in stores and restaurants in resort towns. As well, it has been difficult to get farm machine parts, and the technicians who service the machinery, across the border. The consequences have affected young people's educations and the relationships, family lives and personal well-being of the young and the elderly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us look at some of these consequences in more detail. In March 2020, when the lockdown began, Canada's GDP started to decline rapidly. Our unemployment rate rose immediately. Canadians began losing their jobs en masse as businesses were forced to close their doors. Sales at restaurants went down by 46% in March 2020, and by more than 56% in April. When restaurant sales are down, it creates a domino effect on the whole supply chain including farmers, food importers and wholesale food distributors. Families' entire life's work of building and running businesses has either been completely wiped out or, if they are fortunate, they may still be hanging on by a thread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Mass economic lockdowns should never have been viewed as a long-term measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Lockdowns and restrictions were put in place to buy governments time to get permanent solutions, such as vaccines, rapid testing and variant testing. These tools now exist, so where is the plan?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Last year air travel plummeted, and travel to Canada was practically shut down. This is important to note, because most Canadians do not realize that their fresh produce in the winter, particularly tropical fruit, is imported as air cargo on commercial passenger planes. When commercial planes do not fly, importers are forced to pay a higher fee for air cargo. That cost is passed on to the consumer, which means higher grocery bills or having to forgo buying a favourite fresh produce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are some of the economic activities that have been affected, but how have the COVID-19 lockdowns affected Canadians' sense of well-being? As one might imagine, the segment of Canadians who rate life satisfaction as “high” fell from 72% in 2018 to 40% in June 2020. Young Canadians have experienced the greatest decline in mental health. Pre-COVID-19, 60% of young Canadians reported excellent or very good mental health, but by July 2020, that had fallen to only 40%. This is tragic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Since the COVID-19 lockdowns began, parents' concern for their children's well-being has skyrocketed. Children are spending hours a day in front of screens with limited interactions with their friends. They are suffering from loneliness due to forced isolation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me add that in rural Canada, as in much of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, high-speed Internet access and the cost of cellular data are very real and ever-present challenges. These are real-life problems that cannot be ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The consequences for the mental health of Canadians are significant. Prolonged lockdowns across Canada have led to increases in domestic violence, opioid deaths, mental health crises, business closures and mass unemployment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are real-life consequences of the COVID-19 government lockdowns. They are not nameless statistics. These are Canadians whose quality of life has been sacrificed for long enough. Canadians need hope. They need a clear, permanent path out of the lockdowns to preserve their mental health, and they need a plan to save their livelihoods while using any and every tool available to prevent COVID-19 deaths.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>People need to live in order to live. The government's failure to approve and distribute rapid tests early on, its failure to secure reliable contracts and its inability to come up with a plan to get the country back on track are costing Canadians dearly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am going to shift my focus now to the consequences for the thousands of Canadians involved in agriculture supply chains. Let me speak first to the agriculture sector I know best, from personal experience. I grew up on a potato farm in Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. My family grew and sourced potatoes for domestic and U.S. markets, so I have personal knowledge of fresh table food production in Canada. Even before the COVID-19 lockdowns, fruit and vegetable producers faced labour shortages. These producers cannot find enough willing Canadians to help plant, tend and harvest crops of fruits and vegetables. That is why Canadian farmers bring international workers to Canada, under the temporary foreign worker program and the seasonal agricultural worker program, to help with the growing season from January through harvest. They are critical to Canada's food sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Last year growers near my riding lost millions of pounds of fresh produce that was nearly ready for harvest because of COVID-19. About a year ago, I began flagging to the government potential consequences for the 2020 season of fruit and vegetable production but, sadly and largely, it was to no avail. Last November, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> how they planned to handle the entry of thousands of international farm workers for the 2021 season. I asked them for their rapid testing plan. All I got was radio silence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As recently as the weekend before last, I heard from producers who were attempting the impossible: to comply with unworkable regulations from the government on quarantine for workers entering into Canada. For example, farm workers who only speak Spanish are required to phone nurses who speak only English or French. Employers have been required to forward test samples by Purolator courier from places where there is no Purolator service. Mixed messaging, excuses and shirking responsibility are not what Canadians expect from their government in a time of crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Beef, pork, chicken, turkey and egg producers and processors have also been affected by COVID-19. Capacity on these processing lines has been severely reduced by social distancing measures and temporary plant shutdowns. This has led to weeks of backlogs. Beef and pork producers' capacity has been significantly impacted. At times, this has risen to a level of crisis for producers and processors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians have questions and, after a year of putting up with restrictions and lockdowns, they deserve answers. Any restrictions on Canadians' charter rights and freedoms must be demonstrably justified, meaning that the burden of proof is on the government to prove that the limits it has imposed are reasonable. Canadians know this is not happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have heard, over and over again, from the Liberal government and its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader</Affiliation> that these are unprecedented times. Though this statement rings true, it has been used and misused to justify the worst behaviour unbecoming of any government in a western democracy. It is time for the government to make Canadians' freedom its priority. Abraham Lincoln famously said, “I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts...”. It is time for the government to stop treating Canadians like children in need of a caregiver. They want their lives back. They want to start earning paycheques and stop receiving government cheques.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In conclusion, Canadians want and deserve a clear plan that shows a path and a timeline to end the lockdowns. By now, Canadians should know when things are going to get better and what metrics their government is using to determine the timeline for reopening. They deserve a clear, data-driven plan to support safely and permanently lifting COVID-19 restrictions. The Liberal government cannot keep asking Canadians to sacrifice more without being clear about when the restrictions will be lifted. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to lay out a plan that will give Canadians a clear expectation of when life and business will return to normal.</ParaText>

The member and I are both from ridings in Ontario. The Ontario solicitor general, who I would add is a Conservative, recently weighed in on this. She must be paying attention to what we are doing here. She said, “It is not the role of the federal government to advocate for or against lockdowns.” </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I have often wondered if Twitter would have a negative impact on politics and I certainly thought I heard that today. I know the Conservatives do not believe that climate change is real. Now they believe the pandemic is not real. I could go on about the Liberal government endlessly. As much as I would blame the Liberals for everything, I cannot blame them for the fact that we cannot visit relatives because we are in the middle of a third wave of a pandemic. It is a scientific fact. It is a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know the Conservatives are more upset about Bigfoot than they are about science, but there is this idea that there is some kind of plot out there to stop people from visiting. The plot is the new variants coming out that have to be addressed.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise today. I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="253010" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do want to address this motion. I am glad that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> asked a question last, because she hit on something that hit a nerve this morning, and rightly so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, who moved this motion, said that this motion was about benchmarks and establishing various different degrees by which things should occur, but it is not. The motion does not talk about that at all. We can have all the preamble that we want in the “whereas” clauses, but the only thing that matters is the “resolved” clause in a motion. In a properly written motion, we should be able to strip away the preamble and just use the “resolved” clause to give the direction that it needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The “resolved” clause says that “the House call on the government to table within 20 calendar days, following the adoption of this motion, a clear data-driven plan to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting COVID-19 restrictions.” There is nothing in the motion about establishing benchmarks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to spend some time talking about the confusion within this motion. There are really two parts to this, because this motion is not completely within the provincial jurisdiction, in my mind. There are some aspects that fall within the federal government and some that fall within the provincial government. I will start by talking about some of those that I see as falling within the federal government but that I find very problematic in terms of the way the motion is set up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> mentioned a couple of things in her opening remarks, borders and the airline industry, that are good examples of things over which the federal government has jurisdiction. The federal government has jurisdiction over the matters that are constitutionally given to it and that are set up through the practices of our country since Confederation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reality is that for something like borders, there is a role for the federal government, but the question is whether the federal government should be required to come back to this House in 20 days and say, “This is how we will open the borders. This is the timeline.” That could only ever be the situation if we were able to know not what the results of the variables would be but what the variables are, and the reality is that we do not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>When we talk about opening a border between Canada and the United States, we have to realize that so much of it is heavily dependent on what they do in the United States, what action they are taking and where their numbers are. If we do not have the ability to influence that variable, how would we ever be able to say what the exact plan will be for how things will reopen? It just cannot be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives talk about putting together a plan. I happen to think that it is a pretty good system that is in place. It is reviewed on a monthly basis by the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>. He reviews it with the expert advice that he has, and he decides whether or not to extend it for another month. If the U.S. situation improves dramatically and the expert advice is that we should open that border, I am sure the minister will take that very important advice under consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The same can be said about airlines. Canada is only half of the equation for international flights. Where are the flights going? Where are they coming from? So much of it depends on that and those other variables, so it is very challenging. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us turn to the other part of this, which is the discussion about provincial jurisdictions that has been coming up quite a bit today. Notwithstanding the fact that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> and other members have stood up and said Liberals are just going to say that they cannot do anything because it is not their jurisdiction, in fact some things are not our jurisdiction, as is constitutionally afforded to the two different levels of government in this case.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>When I think of some of the things that have happened in my riding, of the lockdowns that have come into place and how they have been lifted, I have an incredible amount of respect for Dr. Kieran Moore, our chief medical officer of health, who has steered our community through this wave. It has been incredible. We have had only one COVID death in our health unit in Ontario, and a lot of that has to do with the incredible work of our local medical officer of health, who is of course empowered by the provincial government. I think to myself, “Why would we think we have some kind of jurisdiction over our local medical officers of health and the jurisdiction to close businesses?” We do not regulate how businesses open and close. It is not within the purview of the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I quoted Sylvia Jones, the Ontario solicitor general, to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252595" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation>.

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the motion before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will start by acknowledging that it has been a very difficult year for all Canadians. Everyone has been affected by this pandemic in some way or another. In Newmarket—Aurora, we have shared in the suffering from the loss of life, fears for the future, the impact on mental health, the loneliness, and the challenges faced by small businesses, their owners and employees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me assure all Canadians that the government remains committed to doing whatever it takes to help Canadians and Canadian businesses survive through this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>To quote Martin Luther King Jr., “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>From day one, this government has been there with a comprehensive and fiscally responsible support package to help Canadians and businesses of all sizes weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, we have been able to respond from a position of strength. Canada entered this crisis in a strong fiscal position, allowing the government to take decisive action to provide the support that was needed to weather this storm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We started with a low debt position and have been able to maintain that advantage relative to our peers, and with historically low debt servicing costs, the government has been able to afford to take on debt so that Canadians do not have to. Federal debt servicing costs relative to the size of our economy are at a 100-year low, and we are locking in these low costs by issuing more debt in longer-term instruments at historically low rates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The federal government has provided more than eight out of every 10 dollars spent in Canada to fight COVID-19 and support Canadians. These investments represent Canada's largest financial response since the Second World War. The International Monetary Fund in its recent staff report for the 2021 article IV consultation estimates that without Canada's COVID-19 economic response plan, real output would have declined by an additional 7.8% in 2020 and the unemployment rate would have been 3.2% higher. By providing Canadian businesses and families a financial lifeline to pull them through the crisis, the government has helped Canada avoid widespread business and personal bankruptcies and the possible negative impact of that for generations of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, it is not just support programs that the government has deployed. In fact, the very first thing the government and its partners did at the start of the crisis was to make sure that businesses had access to credit. Indeed, the first coordinated package of measures supported financial sector liquidity, the functioning of markets and continued access to financing for Canadian businesses. This included the business credit availability program in which the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada have cooperated with private sector lenders to make financing and credit insurance available to Canadian business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>An important part of the program is the Canada emergency business account, which provides small businesses with access to interest-free loans of up to $60,000, one-third of which is forgivable if repaid by December 31, 2020. After listening to Canadian business owners, the government modified or expanded the program several times, making it available to self-employed business owners and also increasing the maximum loan by $20,000. As of March 11, more than 846,000 businesses have been approved for loans, for a total of more than $44 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government has also provided $306 million in short-term, interest-free loans and non-repayable contributions through aboriginal financial institutions, which offers financing and business support services to first nations, Inuit and Métis businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Furthermore, the government deferred the collection of income and sale taxes from businesses, freeing up valuable short-term cash when they needed to cover other costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This comprehensive package of support has helped ensure that Canadian businesses were able to continue to pay their employees and their bills during a time of uncertainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Fighting COVID-19 and getting the economy back on track is not infinite. Once the need for support throughout the crisis has passed, the time-limited measures will be prudently withdrawn. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>As government supports transition in the next few months from mitigation to recovery, we will draw upon the lessons learned from the experience of many countries following the 2008-09 financial crisis and during recoveries from earlier deep recessions. This experience suggests that most economies that withdrew fiscal support too quickly experienced slower growth afterward, and Canada will follow the advice of the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that governments maintain substantial fiscal support through the crisis and over the recovery phase. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As we normalize our fiscal position in the wake of the virus, we will once again do so from a position of strength. While the federal debt is significantly higher than in recent years, it will be far more manageable than at its historic peak in the 1990s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>When the virus is under control and our economy is ready for new growth, our government will deploy an ambitious stimulus package over three fiscal years to jump-start our recovery to support and grow the middle class. This additional spending has not been formally included in the government’s fiscal framework yet, as the ultimate size and timing is highly dependent on the evolving health and economic situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, to ensure that Canada is prepared, our government is planning for four different scenarios regarding the timing, size and profile of the stimulus spending. The growth plan for strong recovery will take us toward an economy that is greener, more innovative, more inclusive and more competitive. The government has been working with Canadians to plan and prepare our investments for when the virus is under control. The key to this plan will be smart, time-limited investments that act fast while also making a long-term contribution to our shared prosperity, competitiveness and our green transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Despite recent encouraging signs of recovery, we have not yet turned the corner. About one million Canadians who had a job before the crisis are still out of work or working sharply reduced hours, and many small businesses continue to be greatly impacted by the crisis. The Government of Canada will continue to deploy the necessary fiscal firepower to fight the pandemic and then for us to recover strongly, while continuing to manage its finances prudently, retaining its low-debt advantage among G7 peers. The government’s strategy will be implemented responsibly, with a sustainable approach for future generations. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I have been listening to this debate carefully today, and government members consistently say there are jurisdictional issues and that we should not be telling the provinces what to do, because the provinces will have to decide what to do, and we should not be interfering in provincial jurisdiction; hence, the government cannot have a plan at the federal level. That is essentially the message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was just looking on Joe Biden's website, where he posted a plan called “The Biden Plan for an Effective Reopening that Jumpstarts the Economy”. The United States is a republic. It has 50 states with different jurisdictions. It has a federal government that has its own jurisdictional issues as well. If a country like the United States can do it with 50 states and other territories, why can Canada not publish a plan just like President Biden did?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>There need to be a lot of conversations with the municipal and provincial parties so that we can go forward, but we need to remember that this is an evolving situation. There are so many changes. For example, we can look at the variants of concern and how they are impacting us or the province of Ontario, and how we are still at a very high level of infection.

I understood the member to be saying that basically they opened the floodgates and did everything they could to pump as much money as possible into the economy, but I do not think we could do that again.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I think one of the things that has frustrated me about the government's response to this pandemic is this failure to understand the appropriate role and relationship between the public service and our political leaders. The public service offers us expert advice that reflects different expertise in different disciplines, and then it is the responsibility of our political leadership to take all of that advice on board from a health perspective, from an economic perspective and from a social perspective, and to chart a plan or vision for moving us forward in the public interest, in light of all the different expertise that it takes in. Instead, the government says that it is just going to trust the experts, without appreciating its role of receiving that expertise, aggregating it and really mapping out a plan going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Does the member think that the government has a responsibility to actually chart a plan to get us out of this challenge, or does he think that the government can continue to abdicate its responsibility?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, before I address directly the motion before us today, I will first relay a story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Back in 2017, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had an idea. His idea was to use an omnibus budget bill to create a new excise tax escalator on alcohol sold in Canada. This meant that the tax on most wine, beer and spirits sold in Canada would, by default, be increased every year without having to come to the House for debate. As opposition, we opposed this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I warned the Liberal government what would happen if Canadian wines produced with 100% Canadian-grown grapes received an excise exemption. According to Wine Growers Canada, this excise exemption “resulted in more than 400 new wineries and 40 million litres of new wine sales....The annual economic impact of this growth is $4.4 billion annually.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I warned the Liberal government, the problem with the excise tax escalator was that it would make wine produced elsewhere but sold in Canada more expensive against Canadian wines that used 100% Canadian-grown grapes and that there would be a trade challenge on this. To make a long story short, there was. The same Liberal government capitulated and agreed to remove the excise exemption previously enjoyed by Canadian grape growers. In turn, the Liberal government promised a plan to offset the economic damage it created in this industry, but here we are in 2021 and there is still no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do not share this story today to say “I told you so”. I share this story with everyone as a reminder that when governments do not think ahead of their actions, they can make mistakes with serious consequences. Now more than ever, we need to be vigilant and plan; we need to plan for our future today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canada has fallen massively behind other countries in how we have dealt with this pandemic. We were slow to close the borders, we were behind on things like PPE and rapid tests and now we are behind on vaccines. We have spent the most for a country of our size, but we all know we have not gotten the results we desperately need. I do not say that as a finger-pointing exercise. No prime minister would want to willingly be in this situation. COVID-19 is certainly not his fault, but, as the highest office in the country with the most resources to do something, he is responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How has the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> responded? Indeed, as many released documents under production orders are illustrating, the Prime Minister's Office has often tried to manipulate, hide, deceive or distract from these ongoing failures. Now, here we are. We as parliamentarians must do our jobs to do everything we can do to help with this recovery. If members are in doubt of that, I will share a few thoughts and observations that, if some members have not been thinking about, we need to start thinking about collectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us will start with employment insurance. We know that with the phase-out of the CERB, many have transitioned to EI. People who would not normally be eligible are now receiving record amounts from EI. The challenge is that EI, by law, is required to be a sustainable program. While the Liberal government refuses to disclose the current status of the EI account, we know that the parliamentary budget officer has forecast that the EI operating account is on track for a cumulative deficit of $52 billion by the end of 2024, and that is just an estimate. For every day of delay that we cannot deliver a plan to get our own economy back on track, the EI expenses will continue to exceed revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not partisan politics. That is not some isolated situation. This is occurring in every region of our country today. Again, EI must be sustainable. The EI account will not balance itself; it will require a serious plan. If employers are not hiring or are continuing to bleed staff, that will result in more weight on our EI system. That means higher EI premiums to make up the shortfall on those employers and fewer and fewer employees, yet the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers continue to ignore this reality. I believe we all know, collectively, that Canada ignores problems like this at our peril. That is just one example of a need for an economic recovery plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will give another from my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Okanagan, like other regions of Canada, relies heavily on tourism. We now have situations where American citizens who have been fully inoculated, 200 million-plus more every day, are calling to make reservations for upcoming summer and winter vacations. If we do not start signalling by what science-based metrics we will abide by as well as who and under what conditions these tourists can come, they simply will go to other places and spend their dollars somewhere else, not here in Canada, where our small-scale accommodation providers and those small businesses that have been absolutely decimated by this pandemic are in a situation where many are living off credit. They are having tens of thousands of dollars of bookings being thrown at them and they have no idea what to do. Why? Because the Prime Minister has been totally silent in announcing any kind of recovery plan.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>While a lot of tourism is road traffic, let us not forget that many travel to my home province of B.C. by airplane. For those in the aviation sector, it has been just devastating. Here we are, one year into the pandemic and there is no plan, not even an assistance package for this critical industry. What will be the long-term impacts for Canadians be if our aviation sector cannot survive? What of our tourism sector?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Here is something I thought I would never see in my region. Kelowna International Airport is a major artery for economic development of the Okanagan, yet due to its ownership under the City of Kelowna, it has not received a dime in support from the federal government's wage subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In 2019, YLW was booming and had large and ambitious expansion plans. Major parts of that plan have had to be put on hold because of the pandemic. Without any strong COVID recovery plan, like the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has called for, the failure of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to act means less opportunity for jobs and investments both at the airport and around our region that rely on YLW.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The director of Kelowna International Airport, Sam Samaddar, has said that without immediate changes, our country could see Canadians driving to the U.S. to catch cheaper flights from American airports when things return to normal in the future, because of Ottawa's low level of assistance now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the Kelowna Daily Courier last week, Sam Samaddar said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Canadian government’s investment in the aviation industry, it’s been appalling to be honest with you....And here we are a year into the pandemic and I can’t believe we still do not have automatic contact tracing.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are behind on contact tracing and on stockpiling PPE, rapid testing and vaccines. Speaking of vaccines, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has suggested that everyone who wants to be vaccinated will be so by the end of September. The problem is that losing another summer for tourism is a price that many can no longer afford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am certain I am not alone in seeing a growing number of “For lease” signs going up in many downtowns throughout my riding. Many of these small businesses that are closing have been around for many years. Most that I have heard from are either closing because they can no longer afford to keep the doors open or, in some cases, they do not see any clarity, they do not see any point and would rather cut their losses now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Again, there is no plan from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. What we have heard is things like “build back better”. What does that even mean? People cannot build anything without a budget. The Prime Minister has refused to table a budget for over two years. To build back better without a plan, nothing can be built. Essentially “build back better” is just another series of buzzwords.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When we look around our communities, nothing is being built by the government right now. A revised mandate letter was sent out earlier this year, in which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> instructed his <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> not to commit to any new permanent spending. Only months later, the same Prime Minister promised to permanently increase transit spending, most of it five years down the road. That is the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> literally makes it up day by day. First, we are not increasing permanent spending, until we are. Most of it is five years down the road. We have no budget to show how that promise will actually get paid for. What could go wrong here? I think we all know that is not good governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the absence of a plan, that is what we get: made-up promises as we go along. Five years from today, that massive EI deficit in the billions is going to need to somehow be paid for. How? By who? Will workers premiums be further increased? If so, that leaves less net take-home pay at a time when inflation may be undermining our dollar. Is that what building back better looks like? If so, many would dispute that this is a better outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One thing we do know is that these problems will not solve themselves. We all know that this current level of spending is not sustainable. I expect that when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> first told his <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> not to create any new permanent spending announcements, he did so with good reason. We also know that an election is coming at some point on the horizon and that the Prime Minister will only announce more spending. It is what he does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The challenge is that we need a plan today, one that is scrutinized in this minority Parliament, one that is data-driven, that gives people hope and certainty. We need a plan that will help serve as our road map for how we deal with other countries that are ahead of us in dealing with the pandemic. We critically need to help small business. Let us not forget—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the member talked about the EI system, taking care of that and how we had to help Canadians out by using that system during this time. He raises some very good questions about how that repayment has to happen, how we have to build that pool of money up again, on which the EI system banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have a question for the member and I hope he takes it as a genuine question. Does he think we should not have spent that money? Does he think we should have spent less money? I am trying to understand where he is coming from. Yes, we have challenging questions ahead of us, but does he regret this Parliament having voted unanimously in favour of moving forward with those measures?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I will simply remind the member that I was the former critic for the employment minister and we agreed to much of the COVID-19 spending, because people needed it then. However, what people need now is certainty so they can plan their businesses. They need hope so they know that Canada, when we work together, can get further together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member talked about the motion. We are calling for a clear data-driven plan to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting COVID-19 restrictions. I am asking for that. We need to answer those questions. The government is the highest office in the land and it is the best prepared to do this.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I have to agree with my colleague about the plan. We both live in similar ridings. Sun Peaks Resort and Big White Ski Resort are beautiful ski resorts. They and have been hanging on. However, people from across the border come here. They own homes here. They are saying that they just need a plan. They need to know if people are fully vaccinated. They want to know if that will be one of the criteria for the border reopening. They want to know what kind of dimensions or data we looking at on either side of the border because they have put significant money into real estate. They have been very gracious throughout this. They understand what is going on, but they want to have a plan. I expect my colleague has also heard very similar stories. I wonder if he could share some of them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, in my view, there has been a lot of unnecessary fearmongering in relation to COVID-19 and I say it in this context. We have seen provincial and federal leaders not give us the correct clarity. We have seen case counts and death counts.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I want to share some good news with the House. The Seattle Mariners will host 9,000 fans. They just got approval from Washington State, a very progressive and woke state south of the border, whose ideological inclinations are very similar to the government's. They have signed off on a safe plan, according to that state, to allow 9,000 fans to participate at a major sporting event in Seattle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Simultaneously we got the news that our Toronto Blue Jays are not going to be able to do anything similar. In fact, they put out a statement in which they said, “we had hoped to see improvements in the public health outlook as we neared the baseball season. With the ongoing Canada-U.S. border closure, we have made the difficult decision to play the first two homestands of the 2021 regular season...at TD Ballpark in [Florida]”. The Floridian businesses will get all of the benefit of that major sporting event.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is not just sporting events that are reopening around the world. Australians and New Zealanders are finalizing plans for quarantine-free travel across the border between their two countries. Then there is Taiwan, which has pretty much the lowest COVID mortality rate on planet earth, even though it is right next door to the country from whence COVID originated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Brookings Institution, a progressive U.S. think tank, stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Taiwan has managed the spread of COVID-19 far better than most: It suffered only seven deaths among its 23.5 million people in 2020. Except for a few short weeks of lockdown in March last year, life in Taiwan has been normal. Schools, offices, and restaurants have been open as usual, although with temperature screening, hand sanitizing, and social distancing. Live concerts by Yo-Yo Ma and performances of “Phantom of the Opera” have attracted thousands of people into indoor arenas.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>All of this is happening with seven deaths. It is not seven deaths per 100,000 or seven deaths per million. It is seven total deaths since COVID started in the country right next door. In fact, Canada now has 601 deaths per million; Taiwan has 0.42; Singapore has 5.13; and Australia has 35.6. In other words, even if we just compare Canada to Australia in that group, we have a factor of 20 times higher deaths per capita than they do, and we have among the most severe restrictions on our lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is easy to wave one's hand and ask who cares about baseball or artistic conferences or travel between countries, as none of those things are core to human existence, so we ought not worry about the fact that they are still largely eliminated and restricted. However, the reality is they are but symbols of the massive human sacrifice that our people are being forced to make. Not only do we have a ranking of roughly 45 vaccinations per capita, we are ranked 11 out of 15 in the misery index. That is the overall combined misery that we have suffered during the COVID pandemic, according to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not just numbers and statistics. It is human lives. Calls to one suicide prevention line have risen 200% over the last year, reports CBC. That has prompted a Conservative MP from British Columbia to put forward a motion for a single suicide hotline. It is a good idea, but one that we wish we did not have to pursue. We wish there was no need for suicide hotlines, but the University of Calgary has found that for every one percentage point increase in unemployment, there is a two percentage point increase in suicides across Canada. That is the human cost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us go not just to suicides, but also to drug overdoses, which have also spiked during the pandemic. They were up 50% in both Alberta and Ontario during the times Canadians were forced to lock themselves down. These statistics reflect what has happened right across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Even the chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, wrote, “Statistics Canada found lower life satisfaction among unemployed Canadians and noted that this relationship is about more than just money”. She is pointing out in that statement what Canadians who are suffering lockdown in their homes or are restricted from their jobs have known all along. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not just a massive $100-billion economic crisis, though it definitely is that. This is not just about a $400-billion deficit, which is by far the biggest in Canadian history. This is about people's human and very real suffering, which has led to higher mortality rates in countless other areas. I think not only of the drug and opioid overdoses, but also of the suffering of seniors, many of whom, in the tragic stories we have all heard, have had to die alone, separated from the loved ones they have known all of their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In a message I received recently from a senior, she told me she does not know what she has to live for. She has not seen her grandchild for a year and has not seen some of her children for an equally long time. Many of the activities that she enjoyed doing are now banned, and because she is over 80, she does not know how much time she has left. For someone in that age bracket, time is a precious and shrinking commodity, a reality the government, through its incompetence in managing the COVID situation, has exacerbated day by day. This is the very real human suffering that has resulted from the government's failure to safely protect our country from this pandemic and allow us to go forward and reopen our economy while protecting human lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For example, I think of our friends in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on the phone at 3 a.m. with the companies responsible for delivering the vaccines. As a result, he was able to deliver more than 100 vaccines for every 100 Israelis, whereas we are now at around five. Tiny Israel, a small country with endless security and economic challenges, surrounded by hostile states, many of which are controlled by terrorists and tyrants, is managing to outperform Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Then we can look at the other countries of the world, such as Singapore, a tiny island with no resources, and Taiwan, which is right next door to the origin of the disease. I know the Liberals across the way are thinking that Israel, Taiwan and Singapore are ahead of Canada because they are such advanced countries with which we cannot expect to compete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There was a time when Canada had an advanced economy and was among the best places on earth to do business and deliver the necessities of human life. Sadly, those days are slipping away. I fear that we are accepting slowly, as the frog in the heating water, the “loserdom” the government is bringing us into. We have the highest deficit as a share of GDP in the G20, the worst vaccination rates in the G7 and the highest unemployment rate in the G7. These are the results for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is almost a quiet acceptance that Canada, a country that used to be the best, can be behind the rest of the world. It used to be that the United Nations would say we were the best place on planet earth to live. We do not hear people talking like that anymore. They now talk about Ireland, which has a GDP per capita that is 70% higher than Canada. That is a country with a fraction of the resources and land of Canada, and nowhere near the geographic advantage we enjoy here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have to say enough is enough, that we are not going to accept “loserdom” anymore. We as a country should be the best, not just at procuring vaccines and protecting our population, but also at everything else. We have been blessed with more natural advantages than any country on earth and maybe any country in the history of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is time for us to hold ourselves and our government to a higher standard, so we can live up to the expectations we as Canadians had for so long. We need to pass on to the next generation a country that is second to none.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I would like to ask the member opposite as well, as he cherry picks everything, about his lavish, all-inclusive, champagne and penthouse trip to Taiwan with his wife, which was completely somehow avoided in his disclosure to the offices of Parliament.

They all got here by plane, unless he is aware of a trans-oceanic bridge that they would have taken. No, they came here because his government left the borders open even after we warned it not to.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am actually very interested to know what the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> thinks about the approach that Australia took to its jurisdictional differences. Like Canada, Australia has very powerful state governments, as we have provinces, but it organized differently.

              <ParaText>The Liberals told us that it would not help, in fact it would harm, if we closed our borders to travel from the affected countries.

              <ParaText>I will begin where we left off, with the Conservative members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>All day long, I have been listening to the Conservatives speak, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> who spoke about “loserdom”. I should not be surprised, but I cannot believe I am hearing members of the opposition speaking about a public health crisis, which every single country is facing, in this manner. Every measure that has been put in place has been done with the health and safety of Canadians at the forefront. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As other members have pointed out throughout the day, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> went through the technical issues with the motion before us, and the fact that members on the floor from the Conservative side are trying to rewrite or downplay the language in the motion to suggest that it is somehow to come up with a framework. However, every speech I have listened to from Conservative members today speaks about the need to just reopen. It is like they have completely forgotten about the fact, or do not want to be confused by the fact, that there is a global health pandemic crisis ongoing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Recently, we have seen over 5,100 new COVID cases involving the highest transmission strains. The highest numbers are in Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. However, the Conservatives stand and speak, one after the other, to say that we just have to reopen, and they point to the U.S. time and again as an example of reopening. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> referred to the U.S. and Florida. Has anybody from the Conservative Party been watching what is happening in Miami, Florida right now? Are they seeing the incredible number of cases on the rise, and the number of people gathering? In fact, the Miami local government has issued curfews, road closures and, incredibly, more restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservative Party is not known as the party of science and facts. I guess it never was, but it reconfirmed that over the weekend. This is a party that does not even understand that climate change is real. Conservatives claim that climate change is not real and therefore nothing should be done about it, and they want Canadians to put trust in them to handle a pandemic for which trust in scientists is at the forefront. Instead, they believe they know better than the experts, because they say so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are here to say that we are following public health guidance. We are going to listen to scientists and experts, because that is the way we are going to keep Canadians safe and ensure that we can open the economy safely and successfully in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The other point I would like to raise is on the disinformation that the Conservative Party, starting with its <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, puts out. Conservatives continue to say that the Liberals want us to live in lockdown forever. This could not be further from the truth. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> always references the “misery index”. Canadians are absolutely tired of this pandemic. We, as Liberals, are tired of this pandemic. Nobody wants to see their friends, family or neighbours get sick. However, if we do not have restrictions in place, and if we do not put strong health measures at the forefront of our policy, then what is even more miserable is seeing a loved one die. It is never being able to hug that loved one again because they have died. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>With all the hyperbole that is going on with the Conservatives, I think that Canadians want to be assured that their leaders are following the best possible advice to ensure that Canadians remain safe. Hopefully, we can get through this crisis together and resume normal life again, but we are not going to get there with Conservatives rushing to a conclusion that is not based on science and evidence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>It is nice the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> supports the state of Washington making its own local health decisions, but somehow Conservatives do not think provinces and territories have the ability and know-how to do that in this country, and want the federal government to go in with a top-down approach. It is interesting that they support U.S. state autonomy but not Canadian provincial and territorial autonomy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me go over a few of the global health reactions right now to give Conservatives some perspective, because they seem pretty closed-minded to what is happening around the world. We are seeing lockdowns in Germany over the Easter holidays. Paris and France are entering a third-wave lockdown that includes 21 million people. Italy is having another Easter lockdown. Greece is currently closing schools and extending closures. The Czech Republic, one of the hardest hit countries in the EU—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, a little over 20 weeks ago, our government announced the rapid housing initiative, a $1 billion investment. It did not just protect people in precarious shelters from COVID. It was also accompanied by a bold commitment in the throne speech to end chronic homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am proud of, and quite frankly amazed by, how the program has achieved its stated goals. The plan was to create 3,000 units of housing and to work directly with municipalities and front-line housing providers. By working with the cities we can move fast, but by working with housing providers we also managed to make the dollars work deeper. Over 4,777 units of housing were created and acquired. Almost two-thirds of the projects in the project stream will fund indigenous-led housing programs and, because many of these units will house families and children, the actual number of people housed will be well clear of 5,000 people. When added to the now $70 billion national housing strategy, it is clear that ending homelessness is within reach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our government knows there is more to do, but we also know what works. The good news is that there is more good news on the way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the failure to close the borders early, the elimination of the pandemic planning infrastructure and the lack of a true, national pandemic response with all provinces and parties caused more casualties than necessary in the COVID pandemic. Now, severe government restrictions have caused such a rationing of health care that one-quarter of a million urgent surgeries have been delayed. Sixty per cent of Canadians report minor to major mental health issues due to lockdowns, and one oncologist reports that we have a tsunami of cancer coming with screenings and early diagnosis at dangerous lows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>At a Hamilton hospital, youth suicide attempts are up threefold. Thousands of people have died alone and families were not able to have proper funerals for closure. Added to that are tens of thousands of small businesses, and the families they support, that have experienced financial ruin due to unreasonable restrictions: restrictions that unfairly affect single moms, our youth and hourly workers. People know how to socially distance, wear masks when needed and sanitize their hands and surfaces. Governments need to trust citizens and entrepreneurs to be safe, vastly reduce restrictions such as the Ontario green model, and let people have a semblance of normality after a year of COVID sacrifice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I have also met recently with Muslim members in my community who were horrified and deeply concerned with the recent government policy in Sri Lanka of forced cremations, which denied Muslims and other religious minority groups their basic burial rites.

              <ParaText>Canada must continue to stand strongly against these human rights violations and always support measures that promote peace, progress and reconciliation. Today's resolution is an important step toward furthering accountability. We must speak up, stand for justice and accountability and call for an end to further gross human rights violations in Sri Lanka. Our government will always stand up for human rights, both here at home and abroad.</ParaText>

Every March 20, 300 million francophones celebrate the common bond shared by the French-speaking member states of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. This is one of the only international organizations that treats Quebec as a separate state. I am proud of that fact. This day is an opportunity to connect Quebec's political aspirations with its ability to take on the international role these aspirations entail.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, it has been a year since governments in Canada and around the world locked down their citizens in order to fight the COVID-19 virus. While they were accepted as being necessary at first, Canadians want to know the plan to bring these lockdowns to an end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>One million Canadians have lost their jobs and the dignity that comes with them. Seniors are locked away from the people they love. Extended families remain separated. Overdoses and mental illnesses are skyrocketing. The impact of these lockdowns on our children will take decades to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Delays in diagnostics and treatments for serious illnesses continue to have deadly impacts and while we can watch hockey at the bar and shop in the hundreds in big box stores, faith communities are prevented from meeting together, their buildings empty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the Baffinland mining corporation is looking to double the size of the Mary River Mine. Last month, Land Guardians braved temperatures as low as -36°C for days to have their voices heard to defend Nunavut from environmental and cultural harm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Since the mine’s construction, we have heard an overwhelming amount of community concern. One hunter reminded us of something really important. He said, “This is our land—our home—being destroyed and we have to think about our future—our children.” I want to make my position clear. This expansion is a threat to my people, to indigenous sovereignty and to our environment. The government has been largely silent on this dangerous project. Because of this, I will be hosting a telephone town hall tomorrow night at 7 p.m. EST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When the people of Nunavummiut get phone calls to invite them to the town hall, please join me to raise your concerns and let us fight for our rights. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, political engagement is a calling and sometimes even one's life work. It is the will to change things or, I should say, to make life better for one's constituents. In Quebec, this also translates into the fight for our country, and an extraordinary example of political engagement is Carole Lavallée.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Political staffer, director of communications—that is when I met her—chief of staff, member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert for three terms, chair of the Marie-Victorin school board and always a dedicated advocate, Carole has experienced all aspects of political engagement. With a sharp mind, piercing wit and extraordinary flair, Carole is an exceptional politician. As the Bloc's heritage critic, she brought the cultural community together in the fight for respect of copyright. She won a good many battles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today Carole is in palliative care, perhaps even in her final days, with her loving partner by her side. On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, along with thousands of Quebeckers, no doubt, I want to say the following: </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Thank you for all your work and thank you for enriching our lives. Our thoughts are with you.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, this last year has only worsened Canada’s pre-existing mental health crisis. Sadly, as this crisis worsens by the day, the Liberal government shamefully continues to ignore it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians who have hit their breaking point have been put on hold when they reach out for help, because the Liberal government has failed to prioritize a national three-digit suicide prevention hotline. Canadians struggling with mental illness, mental injury, anxiety or depression do not need another “free” government website. Through their MAID legislation, the Liberals have all but given up on struggling Canadians. What a disgrace. We should be helping our most vulnerable live, not only to survive but to thrive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Mental health is health and mental health must be treated and funded properly. An elected Conservative government would boost funding to the provinces for health care, we will incentivize employers to provide mental health coverage to employees and we will get the 988 hotline implemented. The Liberals have no plan, but Conservatives do, and we will act to secure Canadians' mental health care. </ParaText>

He fought for those who were marginalized and gave them back their dignity. He brought people from all walks of life together for Opération sous zéro, a winter clothing drive that provides snowsuits to more than 4,700 children in Hochelaga and across Quebec every year. A few days before his retirement, Mr. Barbier helped a family find housing, furnish their apartment and stock up on food. It is proof that his love of people is contagious and inspires unity and support all around him.</ParaText>

Our government stood by Canadians, and as a result of that support and the resilience of Canadians, the IMF projects our GDP will grow this year by 4.4%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. member's concern about Canadian small businesses. That is why I would like to urge him and all members opposite to join us in supporting Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>. This is legislation that would help small businesses, and he does not need to listen to me. He can listen to Dan Kelly, who says, “Bill C-14 has some important measures for small business, including fresh funding for regional business support programs. CFIB urges all parties to ensure this support is passed quickly.”</ParaText>

The government has repeatedly said that program like the HASCAP and the RRRF were the answer for businesses that had fallen through the cracks, but the criteria for these programs is virtually the same as the other programs that are failing to reach Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The minister admitted at the finance committee that there was nothing in Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> for businesses that had fallen through the cracks because they opened after March 2020.

              <ParaText>I am now ready to rule on the point of order raised on March 10, 2021, by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252939" Type="2">Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon</Affiliation> concerning a discrepancy between the English and French version of Bill <Document DbId="11031427" Type="3">C-19,</Document> An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act (COVID-19 response).</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In his intervention, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252939" Type="2">Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon</Affiliation> informed the House of the discrepancy between the two versions of a section of the bill. Indeed, at the end of subsection 239(2) on page 12 of the English version, the bill stipulates that ballots should be sent to the “special voting rules administrator in the National Capital Region no later than 6:00 p.‍m. on the Tuesday”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The French version, conversely, indicates that the ballot</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>“parvienne au bureau du directeur du scrutin au plus tard à 18 heures le mardi”. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>According to the member, the two texts have very different meanings, which created confusion during the debate at second reading. This discrepancy, he added, suggests that the bill is incomplete. The member cited an extract of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, Third Edition, at page 734 to the effect that when such situations occurred in the past, the order for second reading was discharged. He thus asked the Chair to review the matter and rule on the admissibility of Bill <Document DbId="11031427" Type="3">C-19</Document> in its current form.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>The member for <Affiliation DbId="252573" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation> also stressed the importance of participating effectively in the deliberations of the House, while the member for <Affiliation DbId="252759" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> enjoined the parties to find a solution so as not to unduly delay the study of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In response, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> clarified that the French wording of subsection 239(2) is, in fact, the right one. He explained that the government intended to correct the inconsistency during clause-by-clause consideration at committee. While an error did occur during the drafting, the member stressed that that in no way means that Bill <Document DbId="11031427" Type="3">C-19</Document> is incomplete and that it was indeed in its definitive form when it was tabled in the House. Referring to a Speaker's ruling of January 1987, he added that the error did not make the bill inadmissible because it did not contain blank passages or reach the threshold required to render it incomplete set out in Standing Order 68(3).</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>In order to clarify the issue of a bill's form, it is important to review the existing precedents. A careful reading of the Speaker's rulings reveals that when the order for second reading of a bill was discharged, it was either because it did not comply with an order of the House or because the drafting of the bill was not done or not completed. The following passage must be added to the extract cited by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252939" Type="2">Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon</Affiliation> at page 734 of Bosc Gagnon: “A bill in blank or in imperfect shape is a bill which has only a title, or the drafting of which has not been completed.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In my opinion, that is not the case with Bill <Document DbId="11031427" Type="3">C-19</Document> as submitted to the House. Furthermore, the debate at the second reading concerns the principle of the bill and not its specific provisions. In the words of Speaker Fraser in a ruling rendered on January 26, 1987, at page 2,667 of debates, I feel that this difference “did not affect 'the essence, the principles, the objects, the purpose or the conditions' of the bill.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>In this instance, the error can be corrected by the committee studying the bill. Although it does not happen often, such corrections are sometimes made during the detailed study in committee to ensure that the English and French versions of a bill say the same thing. In the meantime, the government has clarified its intent, and the debate can thus continue on the motion for second reading.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252939" Type="2">Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon</Affiliation> for his vigilance. Let me also also take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of paying particular attention to both versions of bills, so that members have the same understanding of proposed texts, so they can participate fully in parliamentary business and can perform their duties as legislators.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, at the point where I left off prior to question period, I was discussing other jurisdictions around the world that are also increasing or continuing lockdowns or restrictions. I was raising this point to bring up the fact that while the Conservatives ignore the science and ignore the evidence, we are still in the midst of a global pandemic in which lives are being lost and people are remaining sick, and we need to understand the transmission of the variants. While everybody wants to resume normal life again, we cannot do so until Canadians are safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was speaking about jurisdictions because the Conservatives talked about the U.S. and the U.K., but I was talking about other jurisdictions. Germany is in lockdowns; France is entering new lockdowns; Italy is showing lockdowns over Easter; Greece is closing schools; the Czech Republic has lockdowns; Spain is issuing curfews; Belgium is in lockdowns until April; Portugal is in a state of emergency; the Netherlands has curfews. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> brought up Ireland; Ireland is still in the highest level of restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Of course, again members, even throughout question period today, raised the U.S. as an example. However, let me point out that in the U.S., places like Miami are entering into new restrictions. I do not think the members opposite really want Canadians to believe that we should be following the examples of Miami or Texas, where they have got rid of mask regulations and restrictions. At every step in this pandemic, our government has been committed to following the best science and evidence, and as that science and evidence has evolved, we have as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also must point out the fact that the Conservatives continue to ignore that lockdown restrictions or any sorts of restrictions are being decided by local jurisdictions and that there is not a one-size-fits-all. Some areas might require more restrictions and other areas might not. This is the Conservative notion that they know best and that they are going to tell provinces, territories and regions across this country what to do and ignore the science. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We saw over the weekend that Conservatives cannot even come to terms with the fact that climate change is real, so I have absolutely no faith in their ability to manage a health crisis or rely on scientists. When it comes to Canadians' health, we must rely on the best evidence and those who are in a position to guide provinces and territories with that evidence, and allow them to make the decisions based on local requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again, the Conservatives think that they know best and that they should tell provinces and territories what to do, but we need to continue to protect Canadians so that we can come out of this crisis stronger together and get back to normal. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>We are not saying, in any way, shape or form, that lockdowns do not have an important health responsibility and consequence. What we are saying is that there can be no economic recovery without opening up the country at some point, when it is safe to do so. What Canadians need to understand is what those conditions are and when that opening can begin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This motion is asking the government for a plan. It asks under what conditions, and when, we will be able to open the economy, because our businesses, large and small, need to know what those conditions are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Is my hon. colleague against there being a plan for when we might be able to reopen the economy?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, this is what I think Canadians just absolutely cannot stand from Conservative members, which is that they talk out of both sides of their mouths. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>If we read the motion, we see that it is not asking for a simple plan or conditions; the motion speaks to providing the conditions within 20 days for opening restrictions. As well, the member who asked the question comes from the same province I do, Ontario, and the provincial government has said it is the Ontario government that is going to determine the lifting of restrictions, based on the regional and local dynamics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member opposite can say whatever she wants in the House, but the motion speaks for itself. The Conservatives continue to ignore science and evidence, and this is why Canadians do not have any faith in them.</ParaText>

The government cannot wait until the pandemic is over to begin acting on and learning these critical lessons. One of those lessons has to be about paid sick leave for every Canadian worker. The government must fix the flawed Canada recovery sickness benefit to make it easier for workers to access that program.

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to participate in this important debate today on our party's motion that calls for greater clarity from the federal government on a path forward as we recover from COVID. As a New Brunswicker, I can say that circumstances in Atlantic Canada are unique compared with those in much of Canada, but one thing remains consistent: a lack of certainty from the federal government on what the path forward will look like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a member of Parliament for the riding of Fundy Royal, I want to speak for a few minutes on the situation facing tourism operators. Fundy Royal is home to some major tourism attractions, like the Fundy Trail, the Hopewell Rocks and Fundy National Park. Most tourism operators in my riding are small, independent businesses that have managed to build a successful business over their years in the communities. These are small entrepreneurial businesses that rely on tourism. In many cases, this has allowed families to stay in the same communities they grew up in, or it offers newcomers an opportunity to build on their dreams, often in rural communities that they have always wanted to move to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In some cases, these businesses are operated by New Brunswickers who are getting older, but they keep on working because it is what they have always done. It keeps them young and it keeps them busy. In other cases, these tourism businesses are operated by young parents who rely on the income to help keep food on the table and build a life in New Brunswick for their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All of this to say that the past year has been especially devastating for those who operate in the tourism industry. Many operators used their life savings to survive last summer in the hope that they would have a path back to full recovery in the summer of 2021. Unfortunately, while U.S. President Joe Biden has said he is eying July 4 as a sort of independence day from the virus, that is highly unlikely to be the case here in Canada because of the Liberal government's mismanagement in acquiring vaccines early enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The provincial government in New Brunswick established a program to try to help tourism operators with a financial incentive to encourage travel across the province by New Brunswickers. I have heard from many business owners in my riding that this has been very helpful, but of course it does not replace the amount of business they would normally receive. They were counting on increased income from this year to make up for the very difficult summer of 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What these business operators are looking for is some degree of certainty from the federal government on what the path forward will be. I am very concerned that we will see a number of tourism operators close because they are unable to get through this upcoming season. The reason for that is the fact there is such significant uncertainty for the path forward. They have no expectation of when things may return to normal. The messaging from the federal government has been mixed at best. These business owners need to make life-altering decisions on ever-changing scenarios. The uncertainty of the path forward, and even what next year will look like, is daunting to many of these business owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I met recently with Carole Alderdice, the president and CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick. She noted the impact of the lack of cruise ships on the Port Saint John and all of our local tourism operators. This includes every business, from restaurants to small shops to bus tour operators. Of course, most did not expect cruise ships to enter Canada this past summer or even this summer, but with the rapid rollout of vaccines in the U.S. and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s stating that Canadians would be vaccinated by September, some in the tourism industry were dismayed that the cruise ship ban will be in effect all the way until February 28, 2022. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Even more concerning is this: What if those cruise ships do not even come back in the summer of 2022? On the east coast, this would have a detrimental impact on many of our communities. For example, in 2019, Halifax saw 320,000 passengers arrive in the city. This had significant economic benefits for businesses, restaurants and regional tourism operators. The Port of Charlottetown, the Port of Sydney, the Port of St. John's, the Port of Saint John and many more in Atlantic Canada are all hoping that 2022 will see a return of those ships that local businesses rely on.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>I also want to touch on the suspension of flights throughout much of Atlantic Canada. The president of the Atlantic Canada Airports Association said late last year that their industry cannot survive and operate in these conditions and that they are seeing the worst case scenario playing out today. In New Brunswick we have seen a significant reduction in flights, in particular into Saint John and Fredericton. There is also concern that these cuts may be permanent and that the airports will not see a return to travel once the pandemic is over. This would mean permanently lost jobs and significant impacts on local residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are other communities that are feeling the impact and concern about the future, including Charlottetown, Gander and Sydney. The elimination of these flights will have a significant impact on communities in the long term if they are not restored. For example, these flight closures can have a significant effect on rotational workers. A rotational worker flying into Halifax who lives in North Sydney in Cape Breton would need to drive over four hours after landing, often after a very long flight. There are legitimate safety concerns about such a long drive, but it also raises the question of whether individuals will simply move out of their home communities to eliminate that long commute. The Atlantic Canadians I hear from are concerned that these flight cancellations will be permanent and, of course, the impacts permanent as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Conservatives have called for a plan from the federal government that would include the restoration of Canada's regional routes. We need confirmation from the Liberal government members that they will do everything necessary to ensure that these regional flights return. Without them, our communities are at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to touch for a moment on the government's policy regarding the quarantine hotels and the absolute failure these have been. We have heard about the truly horrific conditions some Canadians have found themselves in as a result of this terrible policy. Not only that, but there have also been issues with accessing the phone line to book rooms at these overcrowded hotels. Despite my colleagues calling for data from the federal government on why it feels these quarantine hotels are more effective at preventing the spread of COVID, the government has been unable to present any data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I had a constituent reach out to my office recently who is very concerned about his family's return to Canada at the start of May. The constituent, Brodie, is a professional hockey player who has worked in Denmark and is accompanied by his wife, his five-year-old, a three-year-old and a baby just born in February. He said that when the quarantine hotel measure was announced in late January, it was too late for his wife to fly back to Canada before the measure came into effect. Brodie had previously self-isolated with his family in New Brunswick and followed all the rules. They would gladly do so again if allowed by the federal government, but now, as his work visa comes to an end, Brodie and his family face being stuck in a hotel room. If anyone has young kids, they should be able to understand how ridiculous it is to cram a couple, two toddlers and a baby into a hotel room.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Further, we all know that there has been widespread reports of Canadians not receiving adequate supplies of basic necessities while in these hotel rooms. Having a baby obviously makes this situation even more difficult, as far more resources are needed. I ask that common sense be applied and that Canadians be given the opportunity to simply conduct their quarantine at home, as Brodie and his family had previously done. The government's quarantine hotel program has been nothing short of an absolute failure and should be scrapped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As the Conservative shadow minister for justice and the Attorney General, I want to touch briefly on the impacts of COVID-19 on the justice system. Quite early in the pandemic last year, I asked for clarity from the government on how the courts could respond to the increased delays due to COVID. I particular, I am concerned with the backlog in the courts and how they relate to the Jordan decision by the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> had said that this is something he and his provincial and territorial justice counterparts are closely monitoring. While he referred to a sort of safety valve mechanism for exceptional circumstances, it is unclear how long that will be valid, as Canada hopefully recovers from COVID and the backlog in the courts remain. As the minister would know, the courts were already struggling with the backlog before the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In conclusion, Canadians need a plan from the federal government on how our country will proceed going forward, which is what this motion we are debating today is asking for. For many Canadians, both 2020 and 2021 have been difficult years, but we need to do our part. Canadians are looking for leadership on the path forward and I call on the federal government to prioritize plotting a path forward for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, what we saw over the course of the COVID crisis in the last year was that many of the safeguards that were in place were inadequate. We saw that the response from the federal government was inadequate. For example, when CERB first came out, my constituents were struggling. If people earned even one dollar, they lost $2,000. If people were trying to keep their businesses going, they were ineligible. If people were self-employed, they could not access this benefit. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>I know that there were some great initiatives. Not everything was tossed in the trash. Some things were done right, but now we need to make adjustments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians need hope. They need it even more during this unique, historic, unprecedented time, a time we hope is not to be repeated. The risk remains great, however. This situation has been going on for a little over a year. We are in a public health crisis, and everything has been disrupted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us give Canadians clear information. Let us give them hope. It is the government's job to put forward a responsible plan for Canada's economic reopening. I want to stress the word “responsible”. It is in capital letters right here in my speech. We are not calling for an irresponsible reopening. We are asking for a responsible plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The President of the United States has released his plan. The same is true of the British Prime Minister. I would remind the House that our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> here in Canada has been in power for six years. The President of the United States has only been in the position for two months. He was elected in November, but took office in January.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals better not try to blame the weather or COVID-19, although COVID is being blamed for a lot these days. A new president in the United States took two months to submit a plan, while in Canada we are still dragging our feet. We are trying to move forward, but it seems to me that this government is not very proactive. Even South Korea, Germany, France and many other countries have released stimulus packages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me be clear. This is not about asking the federal government to impose guidance on the provinces. The official opposition believes that it is up to the federal government to issue guidelines, because the lockdowns and restrictions were put in place to give the federal and provincial governments time to find permanent solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have the vaccines, we have the rapid tests and we have the variant tests. We finally have everything we need to present a clear plan to Canadians—everything except a government capable of recognizing that our people desperately need a plan of hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Under the circumstances, Canadians have been very resilient and very co-operative. I think they deserve to have transparency and a plan. Having a plan does not mean opening the doors wide and letting everyone rush into agricultural fairs and movie theatres. Having a plan means having deadlines and benchmarks. Also, a plan can be adjusted. That is part of planning. We need to have this starting point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As the representative of the people of my riding, Portneuf—Jacques‑Cartier, I, like every Canadian, believe we need hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It has been over a year now. People around the world are celebrating the first anniversary of this bug that has unfortunately infected the entire globe. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>We are talking about a plan to support gradually and permanently lifting COVID‑19 restrictions. As I just said, this is a gradual plan. It is not about going in blind or being irresponsible. It is about developing a data-driven plan, and these data exist. The idea is not to put our health in jeopardy or diminish protections for Canadians. The idea is to give Canadians hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are indicators to meet in order to gradually reopen. Some provinces use a colour-coded system, in which the colour changes in relation to the number of people who are hospitalized, the number of deaths or the number of confirmed COVID‑19 cases. These are indicators and benchmarks. We all experienced the first wave, and we adjusted. We came out of lockdown last summer and then went back into lockdown in the fall, but now can we have some hope?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I remind members that back in spring 2020, the provincial governments gave us hope. We can therefore ask that the federal government table a plan within 20 days. What we are asking for today is very simple. We want a data-driven plan to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting COVID‑19 restrictions. The current government has no vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Last April, the members of the official opposition pressured the government to significantly increase support for small businesses and workers. At that time, the Conservatives promised to keep pressuring the government with respect to CERB. We kept that promise, because it was important to ensure that Canadians could quickly get the help they needed throughout this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>From the start of this crisis, the members of the official opposition have said that in addition to dependability, Canadians needed clarity and leadership in times of crisis. One year later, that is still true. Now, Canadians need clarity and leadership regarding when and how the restrictions can be lifted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Fittingly enough, this Thursday is International Procrastination Day. Procrastination is the tendency to keep putting things off until later, either in one specific area of daily life or in general. I think the government will have no trouble embracing this concept, since it is always putting things off until later. We see it in all of our rankings, which are constantly dropping. Canada was leading the way on many indicators, but now our rankings keep dropping. It is embarrassing to see Canada dropping in the rankings of the number of people who have been vaccinated under the current Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to remind the House of a bit of history. It was this Liberal government that prorogued Parliament last summer, in the midst of a crisis. Was that to serve Canadians properly, or was it to protect itself from the damaging effects of the WE Charity scandal? The answer is simple: The government wanted to serve its own interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the midst of a crisis, the government shut down Parliament for two months. Was that responsible? How can we trust this government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is plenty of evidence to show that our businesses, including those in Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, need help and need to know what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Here is a short message I received from a business about opening the borders:</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>I rise in the House today to speak to the opposition motion and, more specifically, on Canada's current border measures. To combat the continued introduction and spread of COVID-19, the Government of Canada has taken extraordinary action and implemented a comprehensive border strategy with many layers of precautionary measures. However, as the pandemic has progressed, new risks have been identified that require Canada to take even greater measures to limit international travel and strengthen our border measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reason for this action is that new, more infectious variants of the virus that cause COVID‑19 have been detected in all 10 provinces. The extent of the spread and the health impacts of these variants of concern within Canadian communities is not yet fully known. It is now more important than ever to ensure that strong measures are in place to reduce the risk of importation and community transmission of COVID‑19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Some Canadians, and I would say some residents of my community of Orléans, have voiced concerns about the stringent border measures in place. However, the Government of Canada has been very clear. Now is not the time to travel. With the emergence of new and reportedly more transmissible variants, domestic transmission rates of COVID‑19 are expected to rise. Unfortunately, even here in our great nation's capital, we have seen the province changing our status from orange to red and the implications it has on many of our local businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Also, following many conversations between the Government of Canada, the provincial ministers of health, our <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and our health experts, we know that our health care systems have limited capacity and infected travellers could burden them. We know that many travellers have and will require clinical care and can also transmit the disease in their households and communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Travel continues to present a clear risk of imported cases, including cases of new variants of concern, and this increases the chance of community transmission of COVID‑19 in Canada. To monitor the importation of variants of concern, and to allow our health care system to recover, these border measures are necessary to reduce immediate risks and protect Canadians. I would like to take a moment to thank all of our health care heroes in Canada, especially in Orléans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To date, we have enacted 47 emergency orders under the Quarantine Act to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID‑19 in Canada. We have limited inbound travel from other countries, repatriated Canadians and strengthened measures at the border. We have twice made amendments to the Contraventions Regulations to include offences under the Quarantine Act, first to introduce new fines and then recently to increase these fines. I will say it again. Now is not the time to travel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The measures we have implemented have reduced the volume of travellers arriving at Canada’s ports, airports and land borders by nearly 95%. This has shrunk the daily number of imported COVID‑19 cases, but despite this decrease in travel, with the emergence of new variants of concern, stronger measures have become necessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Government of Canada introduced new emergency orders imposing stricter testing and quarantine requirements. I will remind Canadians that travellers who are entering our great nation by land or air are required to provide proof of a negative COVID test result for a test taken up to 72 hours before their arrival, or a positive result from a test taken at least 14 days, and not more than 90 days, prior to arrival. Upon arrival, they must take another COVID test. Air travellers must then also reserve and stay in a government-authorized accommodation for up to three nights while they await the results. A third test must be taken on day 10 of their mandatory 14-day quarantine period. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>All travellers are required to submit their travel and contact information, including a quarantine plan, electronically using ArriveCAN before crossing the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is critical to our collective safety to further reduce the risk of importation of COVID and variants of concern, both before and after travellers arrive. Pre-departure testing, combined with testing all travellers upon entry and subsequently in the quarantine period, have shown to temper this risk. Identification of positive cases and genetic sequencing of the virus will help Canada detect novel variants of concern and support public health efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Requiring travellers entering Canada by air to stay in government-authorized accommodations until they receive their on-arrival test results will help to identify and isolate those who may be infectious before they can spread it at home and in the community. Most importantly, changes to international travel restrictions and advice are based on scientific evidence and are developed in consultation with provincial, territorial and international governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Government of Canada recognizes that entry prohibitions, mandatory quarantine requirements and testing protocols place a significant burden on Canadians, including mental health implications, and on the Canadian economy. However, these measures remain the most effective means of limiting the introduction of new cases of COVID-19 into Canada. With new, more transmissible, more severe, and possibly vaccine-resistant variants of the virus in Canada, this government continues to take a precautionary approach that will preserve domestic health care capacity and save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Government of Canada continues to monitor and review the available scientific evidence to determine further border measures, including the use of testing and vaccination to protect the health and safety of Canadians. The Government of Canada remains committed to working closely with provinces and territories, industry stakeholders, indigenous partners, and health care professionals on plans related to border and travel health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We will continue to leverage international partnerships in order to ensure that we can effectively protect the health and safety of Canadians, and Canada’s health care capacity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I have a couple questions in hearing her speech. I really want to ask her about travel. Travel is one of those things that Canadians have said that we need to lockdown on, but at the same time, we also have to continue to think about what travel means in our society. Travel means, of course, external affairs and making sure we have international business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Prior to this latest lockdown, there was a protocol in place at many of the airports in Alberta, particularly in Calgary where I live, that actually did have testing in place that was very effective in making sure that we continued international business and abided by the best testing protocols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Did the government consider the results of that protocol and how we were actually succeeding in maintaining international business before it decided to come up with a new protocol? Can it compare the two results it has seen so far, in terms of the effect on the economy, as well as if there has been an associated effect on less transmission. We have not seen that yet, so I would love to see that.</ParaText>

We would not be talking about variants right now if the government had been the responsible parent it is meant to be and had closed the borders when necessary, instead of taking a laissez-faire approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to hear my colleague's thoughts on this statement, which seems reasonable to me, in light of current circumstances, as we are under the threat of a third wave of the COVID‑19 pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>That is exactly what the Government of Canada has done from the start. At the very beginning of the pandemic, we knew that this was a worldwide problem, and we took extraordinary measures with respect to border restrictions. They were unprecedented. For the first time in history since the Second World War, the border between Canada and the United States was closed.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="253769" Type="18">Hon. Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages (Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency), Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am speaking from the traditional territory of the Kwanlin Dün First Nation and the Ta’an Kwäch’än Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I stand in the House today to speak about the work our government is doing to enable a safe restart of the aviation sector and the work it has done to put in place strong public health measures within the sector to address the risks posed by COVID-19. I think what I say will answer some of the questions that were just provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I can assure colleagues that since the earliest days of the pandemic, our government has been dedicated in working with our vital transportation industry to introduce a comprehensive, layered system of measures and guidance to protect Canadians and those working in the transportation and shipping sectors. For the air sector specifically, this layered approach includes health screening measures and temperature checks to prevent symptomatic passengers from boarding flights to, from and within Canada. This approach also includes requiring passengers on all flights departing from or arriving at Canadian airports to have an appropriate mask or face covering throughout their journey. Canada was the first country to require such a measure, which we now see is standard practice globally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In addition to ensuring that we had the right public health and border resources meeting those passengers arriving in Canada during the earliest days of the pandemic, our government issued a notice restricting most overseas flights to four airports in Canada: Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To summarize these measures and the many more our government and industry were implementing to assist in mitigating COVID risks in the aviation industry, in August our government released “Canada’s Flight Plan for Navigating COVID-19”. The document was the foundation for aligning Canada’s efforts to address the safety impacts of COVID-19 and was developed in collaboration with industry partners. It demonstrated to Canadians the extensive and multi-layered system of measures we had put in place and was based on the comprehensive standards and recommendations from the International Civil Aviation Organization’s council aviation recovery task force report, the CART, and its guidance, in order to ensure Canada is aligned with the gold standard of international best practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>More recently, in an effort to further curb the spread of the virus and new variants of COVID-19 into Canada, we added new rules on international travel. Under these new rules, all air travellers must also provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test before boarding an international flight to Canada. Upon arrival, these passengers must take another COVID-19 molecular test and reserve a room in a Government of Canada-approved hotel for three nights, also at their own expense, while awaiting the test results. We are working hard to make improvements to ensure that this system is working effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our government also recognized that it was not the time to travel as Canada’s public health officials worked to stem the increase in infections and began to roll out the largest immunization campaign in Canada’s history. That is why, in addition to these measures, the government and Canada’s airlines agreed to suspend all flights to and from Mexico and Caribbean countries until April 30 of this year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our government realized that the pandemic was also disproportionately affecting the aviation industry, including those in remote and northern communities like mine that depend so much on small air carriers for essential services. That is why the government announced funding of up to $191.3 million for provinces and territories to ensure that remote fly-in communities continue to receive essential supplies. This includes the northern essential air services subsidy that has been in place for much of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To help mitigate the decline in business at Canada's airports, the government also provided rent relief for the 21 airport authorities that have ground leases with the federal government. Moreover, through the fall economic statement, an additional $1.1 billion in financial support for the air sector was announced. This will be provided through a series of targeted measures designed to support regional connectivity, critical infrastructure investments and the continued operation of Canada’s airports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Air transport stakeholders have also benefited from relief programs that are general in nature, such as the Canada emergency wage subsidy and the large employer emergency financing facility.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>As we look to the future, we know that a strong and competitive air industry is vital for Canada's economic recovery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Now I just want to digress for a moment as a northern MP. Coming from the north, in my personal opinion, there are two things that mainline carriers can do to help themselves during this pandemic, over and above all this other support. They must provide reasonable interline agreements with northern and regional airlines, with end-to-end airfares for those regional airlines. This would help both the major and the regional airline. The major airline could pick up remote passengers to add to their system, and they would not have to lose money by running partially filled flights where the other airline exists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The northern and regional airlines would get seamless baggage transfers, protected connections and throughfare itineraries around the world, so it is a win-win situation for everyone. Why would anyone want two airlines, a major and a regional one, to lose money by running half-empty planes at the same time on the same route, costing the taxpayers even more subsidy? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is just my personal view, but this is a better option than requiring capacity reduction in the markets where there are thin numbers of airline customers during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While preventing the spread of the pandemic will continue to remain the top priority of our government, we are looking to prepare for the restart of the air sector. Our government is working with industry to explore risk-based opportunities that will allow Canada to ease travel restrictions and reopen our borders when the time is right to travel, a time that we can begin to see is on the horizon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Many of the measures I have outlined here, including testing, health screening, masks and quarantine, will likely remain in place for the near future. However, there may be room in the coming weeks and months for adjustments to support the aviation system and Canada's recovery from this pandemic, again when the time is right. This includes implementing a sustainable approach to reducing public health risks today and building resilience to safeguard the system against similar risks in the future. An example would be leveraging opportunities for safe contactless processing of passengers. These approaches will help rebuild public confidence in the safety of air travel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As we eventually move from response to recovery, we will continue to have the latest in science and data drive the decisions that we make. Public health measures that mitigate risks posed by COVID-19 will remain a priority, and our government is committed to implementing and revising existing measures, when we are able, to allow the recovery of our vital aviation sector. We will continue to work closely with the aviation industry to do this, as we have done since the beginning of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I congratulate all those who have spoken today who understand the uncertainty that scientists have about the various waves and the transmission of the pandemic, but we we will base our decisions on what they come up with as things evolve.</ParaText>

That is what this is about. It is about when we can return to life as we remember it prior to COVID-19. The U.K. has done it, with Prime Minister Johnson setting out a data-filled plan.

              <ParaText>I think I realize why Liberals do not like talking about a plan in general. We see time and time again that when they do set out a plan or a goal, they feel to meet their metrics. They wanted to plant a billion trees, as seen in their throne speech last fall. They failed. They said in their 2015 platform that they were going to run modest deficits. They failed. They said they were going to reduce the number of clean drinking water advisories for indigenous people by March 2021. They failed. I think this is where we are understanding why there is such a hesitancy to provide a plan to Canadians. It is because they feel they will not live up to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One member asked if we wanted politicians or experts to make decisions for us. I want politicians of all stripes to listen to the expert opinions and data, and then make a decision. We are elected to make decisions. If members on the Liberal side do not want to make decisions, they should get out of the way and let people who will make those decision do so. I think it is time we had a government that started putting Canadians first, their mental health first, their economy, their safety and their plans for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This motion is about hope for Canadians to have a better life. When we go down this path, people feel like this is just a Conservative motion, but I have a few quotes and statements to cite from people within the Saskatchewan government and business community that really add to the motion we are talking about today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>John Hopkins, the CEO of the Regina &amp; District Chamber of Commerce, said, “The Regina Chamber of Commerce is of the view that restoring and growing the economy must be the priority of the Government of Canada as we emerge from the vaccination period. Millions of Canadians and thousands of Canadian businesses have been impacted by the pandemic. Now is the time to get the economy moving.” That is not a political statement and was not made by someone within the Conservative Party of Canada, but by someone who talks to business leaders every day across Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Premier Moe said, “It is extremely unhelpful for the Prime Minister to be questioning the response of the provinces and creating a false choice between protecting the economy and jobs, and protecting against the spread of COVID-19.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There has always been the argument by the Liberals that this is within provincial jurisdiction and they do not want to overstep their bounds. Time and time again the Liberal government has overstepped its bounds in provincial jurisdiction and now, when it is time to lead, Liberals vacate the premises and want everyone else to take the blame. Then they try to take credit for the pandemic spending, which all parliamentarians voted for and agreed to. When Canadians needed us, everyone, the Green Party, the NDP, the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc Québécois, came together and voted for supports for Canadians when they needed them. I do not think anyone is going to argue with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>James Bogusz, the CEO of the Regina Airport Authority, said in 2020, “This airport helps this economy in southern Saskatchewan by stimulating over $800 million a year in GDP.... That is not a small operation. There’s so many jobs and lives that depend on the airport for income and related business. When there’s less aircraft operating, there’s less work. It’s such a big cascade effect. We feel very strongly that airports are worth saving.” This is the kicker: “We need Ottawa to step up.” I feel there are so many people across Canada who have that feeling right now, thinking that it is time for Ottawa to step up and lead. The Liberals have not done that, like others had done in other jurisdictions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals have failed with many of their plans. The biggest failure they have had so far is the vaccine rollout. We have heard the numbers today about how we have 10.78 vaccines per 100 people and that we are 44th in vaccinations across the world and seventh in vaccinations per day. We are looking at how we can continue to have some hope and optimism when the Government of Canada has failed in its vaccination rollout. The provinces are ready to step up and do the job. My province is ready to step up and do vaccinations. It is just waiting for doses. There are drive-through vaccination stations in Saskatoon, Regina and other areas that are ready. They are waiting for more vaccines and for the Government of Canada to step up and deliver them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another stakeholder that has reached out on the topic of this motion is the Saskatchewan Cattlemen's Association. The chair, Arnold Balicki, sent me a note that said, “Food processors are seen as essential. Of course they are, along with other parts of the economy selected as essential, but they rely on so many other aspects of the economy not deemed essential. It is all connected. Opening up our economy will help businesses survive, which help our essential workers to keep providing our food and other goods and services.” Throughout the country, people have stepped up and done their job to ensure there's a safe food-supply chain. The Standing Committee on Agriculture has issued a report on processors and we know that more funds need to be given so that we can ensure that we have a safe food-supply chain. However, that needs to roll into a plan for reopening our economy and for Canadians to have the opportunity to not just rely on government programs and cheques, but to get back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Every job is essential to the person whose paycheque depends on it. That is something we need to get back to and remember: Canadians want to earn paycheques, not to sit at home and collect government cheques. That is a where a safe, data-driven plan comes into play. There has been a vacuum of leadership on the part of the federal government. The Liberals have failed Canadians time and time again. I and many in Saskatchewan and across this country are wondering if the reason that the Liberals are unable to or are so scared of delivering a plan is that, as in the past, they will not meet their deadlines and fulfill their commitments and will let Canadians down again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is time to put a government in place that will secure our future and our mental health. Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to get into the mental health conversation, which my friend from <Affiliation DbId="252893" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation> did such a good job at, but it is time to get Canadians a reliable plan to reopen our economy so that they can get back to life as we remember it pre-COVID-19.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>According to a reporter at Queen's Park, the Ontario Solicitor General for the current Conservative government in Ontario, Sylvia Jones, said, “its not the role of the federal government to advocate for/against lockdowns.” She went on to say that the framework in Ontario is going well.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question and there might be the answer in some of the statements we have heard from our Liberal colleagues today. The <Affiliation DbId="253773" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development</Affiliation> said there is a study they are looking at that is going to decide how to open and close borders and what restrictions there should be. I would love to see that study and have that information if it is available, so that we know what kind of data they are using to decide the border limitations and closures. If she has that study available, I would love it to be shared with us so that we could make more informed decisions as parliamentarians. For example, if there were a number, maybe the Government of Canada could say what vaccination rates we would need before we could have a plan to reopen, but there is no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Also, I just received a text from one of my constituents asking, if someone has had COVID-19, are they in line to get a vaccination if it does not cover variants? Does someone need to get vaccinated again if they have already had COVID-19?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are all questions that, if there were a safe plan to reopen and the government had done its job and given more information to Canadians, we would have the answers for.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252525" Type="2">Mr. Luc Berthold (Mégantic—L'Érable, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, a year ago, Quebec and Canada were hit hard by the COVID‑19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I clearly remember Premier Legault's and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s press conferences. They were daily events that everyone tuned in to religiously to hear about how the coronavirus would affect our health, our jobs and our lives. There was even an expression the Premier of Quebec used back then: “We're putting Quebec on pause”. That pause was supposed to last a few weeks. It went on for many more weeks and months, and now it has gone on for over a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We remember how people stood together. Across Quebec, rainbows and that slogan, “Ça va bien aller”, were ubiquitous. At the time, everyone though everything really would be fine. Good things happened. Political parties set aside partisanship, and the House of Commons unanimously passed unprecedented support programs in response to the calamity. That was what had to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>At the time, members may recall, we did not know how to protect ourselves from the coronavirus. We had no vaccine and no idea when it would be available. PPE for health care workers was scarce. I will never forget March 2020. Fortunately, Canadians listened, they followed provincial health guidelines and confronted the threat together, a threat we are still confronting today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, the Liberal government, which had a duty to warn Canadians of the threat to our country, failed. The first reason is that it scrapped the early warning unit whose mandate was to predict this exact kind of situation. Instead of preparing to protect Canada, the Liberal government sent tons of protective equipment to China. When asked to provide equipment for health workers in the provinces, the government was slow to do so. When asked to close the borders and take action to prevent COVID‑19 from entering the country, it did nothing. When asked to take action to provide rapid testing immediately, it failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>After seeing the Prime Minister on his front steps, it became clear that the Liberal government was quick to advise Canadians to take action to protect themselves, but it was slow to act itself. One thing is sure: Canadians and employers have been listening. Today, what we are asking for and what Canadians want is a plan. Canadians want to know one thing from the government. They want to know when the sacrifices they have made over the past year will finally end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Everyone around the world agrees that mass vaccination is the most effective way to reopen the economy and get back to normal. Unfortunately, this government failed to provide vaccines quickly to Canadians, such that we are lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to the vaccination rate. Canadians need transparency. Canadians want to have a clear indication of the effects of vaccination and the moment when vaccination will allow them to get back to normal life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is why the Conservative Party moved today's motion, to call on the government “to table within 20 calendar days, following the adoption of this motion, a clear data-driven plan to support safely, gradually and permanently lifting COVID‑19 restrictions”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Lockdowns and restrictions were put in place to give the government time to come up with permanent solutions such as vaccines, rapid tests, and a capacity to screen variants. These tools exist now. The problem is that the current Prime Minister is incapable of ensuring that they are widely used across Canada. Canadians want the government to tell them when and how we can safely and permanently lift the restrictions. The provinces are also asking the federal government the same thing. This plan is more than necessary and the federal government does not seem to realize that it has an important role to play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It must first answer to those who have suffered the most during this pandemic. I will name a few groups that have suffered. First and foremost, I am thinking of Quebec and Canadian women, the first on the front lines of the health network, the first to leave their jobs to take care of their families. Unfortunately, they are also the most affected by domestic violence. Quebec is facing a dramatic increase in the number of femicides. According to a Radio-Canada article, there were six murders linked to domestic violence in just one month in Quebec, when there are usually one dozen a year on average. In Canada, in 2020, 160 women died from a violent act, which corresponds to one woman killed every two and a half days.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Claudine Thibaudeau, a social worker at SOS Violence Conjugale, told Radio-Canada the following: “The pandemic has been used by violent partners as a pretext to exert more control in the relationship. We feared this would happen, and it has. Many victims of domestic violence have also put off considering breaking up.” As a result, there could be a second crisis ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We owe all women transparency and, most importantly, a plan, to end the spiral of violence that many women are experiencing. We must especially prevent the spiral from escalating by ensuring that domestic violence organizations are able to plan for a potential second wave of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also owe young Canadians a plan. According to Santé Montréal in Quebec, more than one in five young adults perceive their mental health as fair or poor. In Montreal, 46% of young people aged 18 to 24 report symptoms of generalized anxiety or major depression; in other regions of Quebec, that figure is 31%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With the coming of spring, we see that the police are ticketing more and more young people who are not abiding by the public health guidelines. Young people also have the right to know when they will get a vaccine and when they will get their freedom back. Teens will be teens, and we cannot expect them not to act their age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am thinking of our seniors, most of whom have not had any contact with family for months. Too many Canadian seniors have died alone. Seniors who have been vaccinated have the right to know when their vaccine will give them more freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, we learned that, starting March 24, the Government of Quebec is allowing dining rooms to reopen in long-term care facilities where over 75% of residents have been vaccinated for at least three weeks. At least these people now know part of the plan. What is the federal government's plan? What vaccination rate does it consider to be the threshold for lifting the health restrictions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Businesses are waiting. According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, or CFIB, many small businesses are no longer in business or are unsure of their future. The CFIB itself now has 15,000 fewer members as Canada enters a second year of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Borders are another issue. Everyone was calling for border closures at the start of the pandemic, but the Liberal government was conspicuously absent. At the time, there was no vaccine and no rapid test. Nobody really knew how to treat COVID-19 patients. Ventilators were in short supply, and the borders were open. Now, we have vaccines and rapid tests. Treatments are getting better and better, and the federal government has worked out how to keep the border more tightly closed than at the height of the pandemic. Is the Liberal government planning to take rapid testing into account in any way? Is it planning to take the vaccinations into account?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Hundreds of thousands of Quebeckers will be returning to Quebec from their winter homes in Florida in the days and weeks to come. The vast majority of them have been vaccinated. They should not have travelled, but they did anyway. These people will come back. Will they have to stay in a hotel for the mandatory quarantine?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me be clear: The at-home quarantine should be maintained, but these people are expecting a clear plan because the situation is not the same now as it was at the start of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians have been exceptionally resilient. Now they need leadership. The motion seeks to give them hope again. After giving so much for the common good, they deserve to have the assurance that things will improve, that the temporary measures will not become permanent and that there will be value added for everyone at the end of this vaccination process. What do scientists think? When do they think the measures could be lifted? Does the government plan to have rapid testing in place and improved screening capabilities for variants? What measures will the government take? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>With current vaccination rates so low, we may have to keep the safety measures in place a little while longer, as we have seen in other countries, but we are also entitled to know what vaccination rate the Canadian government considers to be the threshold for taking action to improve the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is no need to wait for the last case before announcing what is on the horizon. Action can be taken immediately, and that is what we expect the Liberal government to do. It is also what we expect through today's motion. I hope that members of the House will adopt this motion so that we can all have a clearer vision of our future.</ParaText>

It seems information was going everywhere but the right place, which is why we did not get a warning and ended up being caught off guard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My colleague wants to know whether it is too much to ask the government to present a plan within 20 days. I think it would be more worrisome if the government has not already thought about a plan for getting out of this crisis and for getting Canadians vaccinated faster so that we can go back to normal as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If the government is unable to give us the figures and forecasts in the next 20 days, that would mean it has not even started working on them yet. I think that would be even worse. The member should be even more concerned if the Liberal government is unable to answer these questions and present a clear plan within 20 days of the motion passing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, generally, today, there has been a discussion about the use of science. I want to ask the member to comment on perhaps a selective use of science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to thank my wife for pointing out to me a Cochrane review that was done on the use of a PCR test, which has been the fundamental barometer of our approach to COVID at a federal and provincial level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The gold standard is the Cochrane review. A specificity and sensitivity ratio for a test to actually diagnose this type of thing should be over 80%. Only three of 21 tests that were reviewed by Cochrane review, the gold standard in the medical community, showed any specificity or sensitivity over 50%. Its conclusion was that this should not be used to prioritize patients for treatment and that the diagnosis needed other things in relation to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Could the member comment on the selective use of science?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, to conclude my comments today, I want to be clear. We are not asking the government to lift the restrictions right away or to infringe on areas of provincial jurisdiction. We are asking the federal government to take into account the current reality and the availability of resources when it comes to vaccines, testing and treatment. We are asking the government to tell Canadians what it intends to do to get out of the crisis. That is what is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians have the right to know what to expect. They have the right to know what will enable the government to ease the health measures and to encourage Canadians to get vaccinated because, at a some point, the government will be able to give Canadians some good news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Right now, the government seems unable to tell us anything about the future. It is managing the crisis on a day-to-day basis, which is not good. That is doing a lot of harm to the economy and to the health of Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to our motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A plan is basically very simple. When you have a plan, you give guidance and you know where you are headed. This situation is not an easy one. It is an extremely complex situation to manage. This has been the case around the world from the outset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, when someone is in a position of leadership and managing a government, they must be able to develop a series of plans and provide clear guidance. The problem we have had from the start of the pandemic in Canada is that, when it first hit us, we were all waiting. First, we were waiting to see how the government would react to a crisis that was rapidly coming into focus around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We called for the creation of an emergency health committee, which met to start asking questions. I attended the January 31, 2020, meeting and I asked some very simple, basic questions. I asked the officials there about their plan and about what they were working on at that time. I asked them what measures they were taking under the Quarantine Act. They told us that they were getting set up and starting to look into it. I found that baffling. We could see how quickly things were moving around the world, yet in Canada, officials were telling us that they were starting to look into it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We kept asking questions here, in the House, and in committee, but we never got any answers. We figured that maybe the officials were not quite sure where to go, but that at least we had a government, a Prime Minister, a few ministers and people in place to lead us. As a former member of the armed forces and business owner, I found myself thinking about what I would do in a global situation like this. I would create a council of war or emergency council that would meet 24-7 to make urgent decisions. During world wars and all emergencies, we expect the government to sit down and make quick decisions, and this situation is no different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When we knew that the virus was coming, the first thing we expected from the government was a decision on the borders, a plan. In response, we were told that everything was fine, that there was no risk, no problem. We saw that the virus was starting to enter. Since the virus came from China, we were initially concerned about the flights coming from there. Then there was Italy and the flights from Europe. Every time we asked a question about public safety, we were told that there was no problem, that our officers were providing information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is okay, but we saw that other countries were taking draconian measures by closing their borders and putting control systems in place. Asking for a plan is nothing new. We have been asking for one all along. I want to mention that we knew that the situation was not easy to assess, we knew full well that it was an unknown virus with varying effects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As the weeks went by, we saw countries get organized and react. Watching the news we saw that countries were moving teams on the ground and things were happening. In the meantime, in Canada, we were told that there was no problem. Looking back at our initial concerns, our questions were legitimate. In an emergency situation, we usually want a plan. We did not have one, we simply got inane answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Obviously, the virus got into the country. It spread, particularly in long-term care homes in Quebec at the start. The virus obviously attacked vulnerable people and, today, over 20,000 Canadians have died because of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government says that it is easy for the opposition parties because all they do is complain and ask questions. It is true that it is easy to do that. However, when we have been asking the right questions from the start and not getting any answers, we have the right to be concerned and to think that there is starting to be a major problem. That has always been the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Then the financial measures were addressed. We had to help businesses and go into lockdown. The Conservatives agreed. We knew that it would cost a lot of money, but we wanted to do our job. We had to step back and help businesses and Canadians. However, we wanted guidelines to be put in place to prevent abuse and so that the money would actually go to businesses that had to shut down and to people who lost their jobs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The government's response was that Conservatives were trying to block the process and did not want to help Canadians. I find that kind of response to legitimate governance concerns so insulting. We just wanted to ensure good governance in the midst of that very complex situation. We were not against helping people. We just wanted rules that would prevent problems cropping up later. We wanted to work as a team. The <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> even asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to sit down and work as a team, but that did not work out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again, that is how it has been for the past year every step of the way. Every time we asked for a plan, there was no plan. Financial support measures now amount to $400 billion, and there are some incredible questions being asked about how things were done that could have been avoided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are not looking to nitpick and identify minor problems. We are dealing with facts and situations that are blowing up in our face. Let us consider vaccine development. When these efforts began, we learned in oral question period that the federal government had conducted negotiations with CanSino, a company controlled by the Chinese communist regime. Clearly, the Chinese government decided to thwart us and stopped the samples at the airport by prohibiting their export to Canada. We lost three months because it was not until three months later that we learned about the Chinese manoeuver. We then had to renegotiate with other companies. We do not know the details of these agreements and we do not know what was negotiated. The only thing we are told is that Canada has the largest number of vaccine doses in the world, even though we know that the Canadian vaccination rollout is lagging behind that of other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is why we are asking questions about the planning process and about plans. When we see the decisions that were made, it seems to us that there were other ways things could have been done. If there is a problem, why does the government not sit down with the opposition leaders in private and ask them to make arrangements to figure out a solution together? Everyone would have been happy to do that because this was not a situation where we were trying to score political points. It was not a situation where we woke up in the morning and said to ourselves that we were going to ask the government questions to cause trouble for it. We were not there for that. We were all in the same situation. We all had to stay home and attend too many Zoom meetings. We are tired of Zoom meetings. We all want to be done with them. Business owners, residents, everyone in our ridings is fed up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a result, when we say today that we want a plan, we just want something to assess. The government needs to stop saying that the provinces bear all the responsibility because we already know that they are responsible for administering the vaccines and screening people. All the Prime Minister needs to do is tell people when every Canadian will be vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While the government says that we will all be vaccinated once by July 1, there is one small problem. One dose of vaccine is not enough, and a second dose is needed to be considered fully vaccinated. What happens then? If plan A is that everyone receives one dose of vaccine by July 1, this still raises the same concerns, the same uncertainty around the administration of the second dose of vaccine. If that is the plan, clarification is needed, otherwise everyone will think they are free and clear and they can party beginning July 1, when that will not be the case. The government seems to be waiting to tell us, because it knows very well that this is problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Political calculations are being made right now. However, the real calculations to be made should be about the mood of Canadians, their mental health and the disillusionment of businesses that have had to close. That is what is most important. When we ask for a plan, we simply want to be given the real story and told where we are headed. We will appreciate our government for doing that, but as long as it keeps this a secret, everyone has doubts, and that is where things go wrong.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, when the member was talking, to my understanding, he kept saying that all the Conservatives are doing through this motion is asking for a plan, and that they just want to know what the plan is. However, the motion actually calls for a lot more than that. The motion calls on the House to table a plan within 20 calendar days following the motion outlining the exact process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member before him criticized me for my previous comments when I said that we needed to listen to experts, because experts inform us. Yes, it is our job to make decisions, but it is our job to make policy decisions, not to implement actual policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I wonder if the member can comment on the discrepancy between what I understood him to say and what is actually written here about bringing back something concrete in 20 days.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, there is a simple answer to that question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The pandemic has been going on for so long that the government should not even need the full 20 days because it should already have a plan. On November 12, 2020, workers in the airline industry on forced leave called for a plan. On February 19, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business called for a plan. On March 16, Unifor-Québec called for a plan. This is not the first time the government has been asked for a plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are here to represent our constituents and to answer questions from them and from groups. We would like the plan within 20 days, but it should already be written. It is surely saved on a computer somewhere, so the government should hit send. If the government has not come up with any kind of plan in the past year, then we have a serious problem.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>With point (ii) of the motion, the Conservative Party seems to want to make the temporary restrictions permanent. Quebec and the Canadian provinces are responsible for what happens in health care within their borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Is point (ii) an indication that the Conservative Party wants to interfere in Quebec and provincial jurisdictions? Does it want whatever comes under federal jurisdiction to be permanent? Which restrictions should be permanent?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, that is a great question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The last thing the Conservative Party wants is to interfere in provincial jurisdictions. Unlike the Liberal Party, decentralization is what we are pushing for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, in a health emergency like the one we are currently experiencing, we expect the Public Health Agency of Canada to issue clear guidelines so that the provinces can do their job. When the guidelines are not clear, governments do not know what to do. That is problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When we ask for temporary measures to be made permanent, we are talking about health measures that will be adopted by the provinces, and they can apply them as they see fit. It is the lack of clarity that is causing the biggest problem.</ParaText>

We have had a lot of issues, in particular our small businesses and the huge impact that COVID-19 has had on them. Many of our constituents have health issues. They are talking about a 60% drop in cancer surgeries. There is a huge increase increase in mental health issues. Also, Canadians right on the border are coming back to Canada and going to rural areas. When they take the required COVID test, they are supposed to call Purolator. However, Purolator will not come to rural areas to pick those tests up. </ParaText>

          <ParaText>The House resumed from December 8, 2020, consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230, An Act respecting the development of a national strategy to redress environmental racism</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253046" Type="2">Mr. Eric Melillo (Kenora, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is great to see you in the Chair again. I hope to join you in Ottawa very soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is an honour to join the debate today on Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>, which deals with a national strategy to redress environmental racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Preserving our natural environment is one of the most important issues of our time as is building a more just society and supporting Canadians of all races and from all walks of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The people of the Kenora riding know the importance of our environment quite intimately. In northern Ontario, hunting, fishing and ecotourism more broadly are a part of our way of life and a major driver of our economy. We understand how essential it is for clean air, clean water and a vibrant natural environment now, but also preserved for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Unfortunately, we have also seen first-hand how legacy failures by various governments have harmed the environment and the health and well-being of racialized people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>After I was elected in 2019, I used my first intervention in the chamber to raise the issue of mercury poisoning in the Grassy Narrows First Nation. Members of this nation as well as those of Whitedog in my riding have been suffering the effects of mercury poisoning, such as muscle weakness, cognitive impairments, reduced vision, hearing and speech, for decades. It was not until last year that the government finally signed an agreement for a treatment facility in these communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In both communities, the water systems were contaminated when toxic waste was dumped into the English and Wabigoon river systems in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2016, it was reported that the fish in Grassy Narrows, specifically, still had the highest levels of mercury contamination in the province of Ontario. This is perhaps the greatest example of environmental racism in Canada and the government allowed it to continue for five years under its watch without action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Of course, we also remember the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s smug and condescending comments toward protestors of this injustice at a Liberal fundraiser in 2019. He thanked these individuals for their donations without even attempting to address the real and urgent issues they were hoping to bring to his attention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Contaminated or otherwise unsafe water is an unfortunate and unimaginable reality, yet it is the reality for many first nations across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On March 1, the Globe and Mail reported that 39 first nations were under long-term boil water advisories. Several have gone without clean water for more than a decade. Last month, the Neskantaga First Nation, also in my riding, marked 26 years under a boil water advisory. Of course, members may recall that last year the residents of this community actually had to evacuate entirely because there was a breakdown of their water system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberal government promised that all long-term boil water advisories would be ended by March of this year. Of course, it is now March and we know that it is not close to reaching that goal and has not even set a new date for when it hopes to achieve that. It has blamed its lack of progress on the file on the pandemic, but that excuse frankly does not add up. We know it was on track to miss its timeline long before COVID‑19 ever hit. We also know that many indigenous communities have been incredibly diligent about fighting COVID‑19 have nonetheless been finding ways to get essential work done on reserve, while protecting the health and safety of their residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Many indigenous people across the country and indeed all Canadians see this delay for what it is, and that is the government once again putting their needs on the backburner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I truly worry about how continuing with the failures of the past will prevent us from securing a more prosperous future. If the government is serious about addressing environmental racism, I suggest it place much more urgency on the issues of clean water in first nations across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>We also know that many indigenous people, particularly in remote and northern communities, like those in my riding, will be disproportionately impacted by climate change, and ridings like mine will bear the brunt of many of the challenges. Remote communities face unique circumstances. Some of these challenges are related to their geography of course, but many are exacerbated by chronic underfunding, discriminatory legislation and environmental neglect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the past few years, residents of communities such as Bearskin Lake and Fort Hope in the riding of Kenora have been forced to evacuate because of floods and fires, respectively. These extreme events are expected in my region; however, they have been increasing in frequency and severity in recent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I frequently hear concerns from residents of remote communities in Kenora who rely on ice roads as a major transportation route for essential items. Shorter and milder winter seasons, as we experienced this past year, are limiting many people's ability to use these road systems, and this is cutting off many northern communities from vital resources. Residents of these communities are resilient, but their opportunities are often limited by insufficient infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Housing shortages, lack of transportation and limited access to goods and services all have negative impacts on health, nutrition, financial security and the emergency response in the north. These issues will only get worse as the climate changes and weather patterns become even more erratic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Indigenous communities have been raising concerns about this for years, and since being elected, I have been fighting for real support in these areas. However, the lack of action from the government has been disheartening. Barely anything has been done to address the current challenges that remote communities face, let alone to prepare them for the consequences of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do appreciate the very real and important issues the member for <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> is aiming to address with this proposal. However, there are many questions we still need answers to. How will we prepare remote communities to respond to natural disasters if they continue to increase in frequency? How will we support hunters and anglers in maintaining their traditional ways of life as ice thins and wildlife behaviour changes? How will we ensure that communities relying on ice roads will not be cut off from the rest of the country when temperatures rise and winter seasons shorten? How will we ensure that houses and other facilities in these regions can withstand severe weather when the buildings they currently have are in an advanced state of disrepair?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>These questions must be answered. Frankly, time is of the essence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We can and must work to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change. We can invest in new technologies and work with industry to reduce emissions. We can support Canadians who want to practice sustainability in their daily lives. We can take transformational actions, just as former prime minister Brian Mulroney did with regard to acid rain, to combat the environmental crises of our time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also need to do right by the people who are already feeling the effects of environmental degradation. I do not believe we as Canadians can trust the current Liberal government to do that, because right now the Liberal track record on these issues has been all talk and very little action. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> committed to preserving our environment, reducing emissions and bringing clean water to first nations communities, but under his leadership, emissions have risen, critical habitat has been lost and indigenous communities are still underserved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How can anyone take the government at its word when its environmental record remains one of failure to back up its big promises with action? The government has had over five years to address these issues with meaningful legislation and tangible actions, but it has completely failed to do so. Its inaction has increased inequality, food insecurity and negative health outcomes for indigenous communities. We need to do better, and that is why Canada's Conservatives will continue to raise the voices of those who have been disproportionately impacted by these legacy government failures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will end my remarks there. It has been a pleasure to join the discussion today.</ParaText>

          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Michaud" id="11201758">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252929" Type="2">Ms. Kristina Michaud (Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure for me to rise on behalf of the Bloc Québécois and the people of Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia, particularly to talk about the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to begin by thanking my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> for her work and for introducing this bill. I want her to know that the Bloc Québécois has big ambitions when it comes to the environment. We welcome bills that address this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Her bill touches on a particularly worthwhile issue, a concept that has not been very well known until now, and that is environmental racism. I myself had to read up on this concept before I spoke about it, and I have to say that I learned a lot. I think it is important to talk about what this concept means. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Environmental racism is a grassroots concept, but that does not make it any less real. It is a concept that exists in the broader context of the environmental justice movement, which originated in the United States. It is based on the connection between nature and social factors, such as class, gender and race.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Canadian Race Relations Foundation defines environmental racism as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A systemic form of racism in which toxic wastes are introduced into or near marginalized communities. People of colour, indigenous peoples, working class, and poor communities suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards and the location of dangerous, toxic facilities such as incinerators and toxic waste dumps. Pollution of lands, air and waterways, often causes chronic illness to the inhabitants and change in their lifestyle. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>According to this definition, the concept of environmental racism is intrinsically linked to that of systemic racism. At the same time, it is not exclusively linked to minorities because it includes more varied vulnerability criteria, so is calling it exclusively a form of racism justified?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is without a doubt good reason to add environmental factors to the social determinants of health. Essentially, the definition of the concept of environmental racism seems vague. Without a clear definition of this concept, I think it is difficult to develop a public policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>More pragmatically, the fact that this concept is linked to a wide range of social phenomena poses a real challenge in terms of public policy development. In this specific vision of environmental justice, policies have to adapt continuously to the variety of situations encountered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The concept of environmental racism was popularized in Canada by Dr. Ingrid Waldron, a professor at Dalhousie University. According to her, every community experiences these issues in its own unique way, which makes it challenging to take concerted action for social, economic, political and environmental justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is one thing for social movements to adapt their political battles to the realities on the ground. Just look at the opposition to pipeline projects like Energy East or the Coastal Gaslink pipeline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The challenge is quite different for lawmakers who have to draft legislation that serves justice and has to apply to all citizens. A good policy is a universal policy that serves the common good and applies to the entire population. Universal public policies dismantle unequal structures and discriminatory practices. That seems to be the purpose of Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C‑230</Document>, but that will not be the result. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Whether in Quebec, France or elsewhere, the social policies that have best served the advancement of rights, social protections and reduced inequalities are universal policies that apply to everyone. I would like to remind the House that the Bloc Québécois strongly believes in the principle of universality, which involves promoting the economic and social well-being of all members of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The best way for the government to avoid discriminating based on differences is to blind itself to differences. If we institute new policies based on new rights, such as the right to a clean environment, everyone should have them. If the policy is well thought out, those who suffer the most from injustice will receive help and support from the government. If the rights and the eligibility criteria for government protection and support are universal, then the policy will eliminate inequalities based on differences. Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> does not meet these criteria of universality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The second problem with this bill is that it is a direct infringement on Quebec's environmental sovereignty. One striking example is the following clause: “assess the administration and enforcement of environmental laws in each province”. In other words, the federal government would no longer respect Quebec's environmental legislation. It would give itself the right to assess the administration and enforcement of environmental laws in Quebec and every province. I am sorry to say that the Bloc Québécois cannot agree to such a clause. Quebec's territory belongs to Quebec, and it is up to the Government of Quebec to protect it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C‑230</Document> puts the Minister of the Environment in charge of the national strategy. The choice of the minister is not bad in itself, but we need to first consider the intersectionality of environmental racism, which requires a horizontal approach involving multiple departments. For example, the environment is a shared jurisdiction, and social policy is not a federal responsibility.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Next, who is to say that the federal government has the constitutional jurisdiction to implement the measures in this bill?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The fact that the federal government wants to consult other levels of government is not sufficient, in the context of Canadian federalism, to justify that same government's intrusion in areas that are the jurisdiction of Quebec and the other provinces. The federal government can legislate on environmental matters, but only in areas under its jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> does not concern fisheries or navigation and shipping and does not apply solely to federal public property. The bill makes no reference to any criminal matters, nor does it establish an obligation to adopt environmental mechanisms in conjunction with provincial governments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Need I remind members that the clause about assessing the administration and enforcement of environmental laws in Quebec is unacceptable to us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The federal government has a long way to go if it wants to respect Quebec's environmental sovereignty at long last. It should start by taking care of its environmental responsibilities, such as the management of dangerous goods. The federal government's practices with regard to the management of radioactive waste are particularly questionable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Under the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal Parliament exercised its declaratory power to assert jurisdiction over nuclear energy. The federal government therefore needs to accept responsibility for its decision and live up to its responsibilities by ensuring that no human being in Quebec or Canada is exposed to the hazards of nuclear waste. As for the rest, as I said at the beginning, Quebec's territory belongs to Quebec, and it is up to the Government of Quebec to protect it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If the current government really wants to fight climate change and social inequality, it does not need Bill C‑230 to do so. It does not need to bring up environmental racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is already scientific evidence to show that it is the most vulnerable people, the most disadvantaged, the ones living in the poorest neighbourhoods, who experience the most direct harm from the environmental crisis. Yes, cultural minorities and immigrants are overrepresented in those neighbourhoods. Yes, indigenous people are among the hardest hit. The data is there. What we need now is political will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have known for more than 30 years that climate change affects our physical and mental health. Natural disasters, heat waves, floods, poorer water quality, reduced food quality and quantity, and the emergence or development of new diseases are all factors that affect human health. Not only are these phenomena getting worse, but they can also appear simultaneously. What happens then? Health risks skyrocket, and vulnerable people's lives are in jeopardy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We can tell ourselves that the impact of climate change on health is felt elsewhere, far from home, but that is like burying our heads in the sand. Quebec and Canada are already feeling the impact of climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Remember the 2018 heat waves. In and around Montreal, that heat wave killed 66 people. Mapping where those deaths occurred reminds us of the influence of social inequality on health, because the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods had the most deaths. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Other local examples include increasingly poor sanitation in indigenous communities. Rising waters and changing seasons are leading to a whole new set of mental health problems and food shortages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The problems do not end there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If we keep fuelling climate change with our polluting emissions, everyone's health will be compromised. Canada is already being hit with climate change events such as heat waves, forest fires and floods. They will certainly become more frequent in the coming years. The health risks of climate change include heat-related illnesses, lower air quality due to pollution, contaminated water sources, and diseases spread by insects, ticks and rodents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The literature makes it quite clear that the least fortunate members of our society, which includes a huge proportion of indigenous peoples, racialized individuals and immigrants, will also bear the brunt of the consequences of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is up to us as policy-makers to be aware of this and stop dithering over the need to immediately reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not, we will be contributing to jeopardizing the health of the public now and in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is why the Bloc Québécois position is not motivated by opposition to the will expressed in Bill C‑230 to resolve a real social problem, but by whether the bill could change anything. The Bloc Québécois is concerned about quality of life and access to a healthy environment for all Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Over and above Bill C‑230, the appalling living conditions in some of our communities, which have no access to a healthy environment, are unacceptable, and governments must live up to their responsibilities in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Environment-based human rights need to be developed. These rights, and the policies that stem from them, will have to be universal. Everyone must have them, regardless of their differences. Only then will we have powerful legal tools to address the inequities and discrimination caused by unequal environmental factors, such as exposure to pollution or lack of access to clean drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Unfortunately, Bill C‑230 cannot fulfill this vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Bloc Québécois is working hard and pushing for an independent Quebec, one based on mutual recognition with indigenous nations, in which all citizens are equal and enjoy the benefits of social and environmental justice.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252890" Type="2">Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> for bringing forward this important bill to address environmental racism. The bill tabled by the member requires the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> to develop a national strategy to promote efforts across Canada to redress the harm caused by environmental racism. I certainly hope that the government will support this bill and take meaningful action to really redress environmental racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As we know, across Canada toxic dumps, polluting projects, risky pipelines, tainted drinking water and the effects of the climate crisis disproportionately hurt indigenous, Black and racialized communities. We need look no further to see the impacts of Canada’s colonial history on indigenous people. However, even as successive governments say they recognize these historical injustices, so far we are only seeing tiny, incremental measures to right such wrongs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>According to the government’s own website, currently there are 58 long-term drinking water advisories in first nations communities. There are two in British Columbia, six in Saskatchewan, four in Manitoba and 44 in Ontario. I should note that many of these communities have had such conditions for years, and in some cases for decades. The First Nations Health Authority’s Environmental Public Health Services indicate that there are both “do not use” and “do not consume” water advisories in our first nation communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>“Do not consume” advisories are issued when a community's water system contains a contaminant, such as a chemical, that cannot be removed from the water by boiling. The water should not be used for drinking, brushing teeth, cooking, washing fruits and vegetables, making infant formula or other drinks, soups or ice cubes, for bathing infants and toddlers, or for pets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>“Do not use” advisories are issued when the water system contains contamination that cannot be removed by boiling and consumption of the water poses a health risk. Exposure to the water when bathing could cause skin, eye or nose irritation. In what universe is this okay?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Behind every community are the faces of the people: children, elders and people with disabilities. They are the faces of all of us. Water is life, yet they cannot access basic clean drinking water, which is essential to sustaining life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is happening in indigenous communities right now. This is what environmental racism looks like. As an ally of indigenous people, I have attended countless protests and rallies led by indigenous people: the first people, the protectors of mother earth, of water and land. They have demanded accountability. We have protested Canada’s ongoing active engagement in land dispossession and resource exploitation in their territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Look at what is happening with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ignored the voices of the indigenous people, elders and protectors of land. He ignored the science on the climate emergency, brought the Trans Mountain pipeline in and pushed ahead on the expansion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is completely oblivious to his own hypocrisy. He cannot call himself an environmentalist and buy a pipeline. Thousands of people have come out as allies to indigenous communities who are opposed to the expansion. Some have been arrested for fighting to protect the environment. Watch houses have been set up to monitor the situation, and people are there in the rain and snow. Land defenders continue to take to the streets to protest the TMX expansion. We must stop throwing away billions of dollars on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and fossil fuel subsidies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Parliamentary Budget Officer has analyzed the Trans Mountain pipeline and shown that, in all the scenarios it has modelled, there is almost no chance that the pipeline would be profitable. That undercuts the Liberals' claim that the pipeline is needed to pay for green energy investments.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The Tsleil-Waututh Nation conducted an independent assessment of the project and found that there was a 79% to 87% chance of a spill in its waters over the next 50 years if the project is built. In the worst-case scenario, it projected there is a 29% chance of a spill of over 100,000 barrels. The risks are real. The question is not whether there will be a spill; it is when there will be a spill. These risks are exactly the reason the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and other first nations have not given their free, prior and informed consent to the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is buying the TMX pipeline and pushing ahead on its expansion, and this is a clear violation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. So much for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s most important relationship. This is no joke. The day the government announced it was buying the TMX pipeline, there were new environmental violations for the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The truth is that systemic discrimination has been embedded in our environmental policy-making. Enforcement of environmental regulations and laws is often lax. In fact, most recently, it was found that there have been repeat violations of COVID-19 protocols on the site. According to Burnaby Now, a report by the Canada Energy Regulator found there was “systemic non-compliances” of COVID-19 rules at the TMX expansion project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canada’s environmental decision-making process excludes indigenous, Black and racialized communities. Make no mistake about it: This is environmental injustice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are other examples of environmental racism in Canada, including the horrific mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows. In addition to the frightening health effects of mercury poising and cancer from toxic waste, the high levels of contamination forced the community to stop commercial and tourist fishing, one of its last avenues for traditional economic living, while the Ontario government continued to insist the poisoned fish were safe to eat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In urban areas, 25% of the neighbourhoods with the lowest socio-economic status are within a kilometre of a major polluting industrial facility, compared with just 7% of the wealthiest neighbourhoods. This results in an elevated risk of hospitalization for respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Vancouver East, our East Village neighbourhood has campaigned for years, fighting against odours coming from the poultry plant in the community. The community has learned that West Coast Reduction is looking at increasing emissions of ammonia, nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxides. Rightfully, my constituents are concerned about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have brought this up with Metro Vancouver, which regulates air quality for our region. Councillor Adriane Carr is the chair of the Metro Vancouver committee that oversees air quality, and she has advised that it will consider input from concerned parties right up to when the permit decision is made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In another part of my riding, community members are concerned about the activities of the port. They have been raising concerns about the well-being of a bird marsh at Crab Park. They are concerned that the Port of Vancouver's security fence, which has been put around the four-acre empty parking lot beside Crab Park, will negatively impact the birds there, and they note there are 26 species of waterfowl in Burrard Inlet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Crab Park is a sacred space for the people of the Downtown Eastside. They fought hard for it and of course they want to ensure that it is protected. They also want to see a healing lodge at Crab Park to support people in our community so they are able access a safe place, a place of healing, especially in the face of so much stress and trauma from the homelessness crisis, the opioid crisis and now the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In 2019, Baskut Tuncak, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and hazardous substances and wastes, wrote, “I observed a pervasive trend of inaction of the Canadian Government in the face of existing health threats from decades of historical and current environmental injustices and the cumulative impacts of toxic exposures by indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In September 2020, a report entitled “Visit to Canada—Report of the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes” was submitted to the Human Rights Council. It states, “Pollution and exposure to toxic chemicals threaten the right to life, and a life with dignity”. It also says, “The invisible violence inflicted by toxics is an insidious burden disproportionately borne by Indigenous peoples in Canada.” Canadians have the right to a healthy environment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the Bloc Québécois does not support Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> because, although the Bloc Québécois believes in a cleaner and fairer world, this bill is unfortunately a direct attack on Quebec's environmental sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Bloc Québécois is fully aware that there are disparities in living standards in Quebec and Canada. We are very concerned about that and have been for a long time. Our political agendas are already full of proposals that seek to make Quebec a cleaner and fairer nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It gives me great pleasure to say that, when it comes to environmental and social policies, Quebec sets an example for the whole world in the way it protects its land and its plant and animal life and the way it fights social inequality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Although the Bloc Québécois does not support Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>, we do support government efforts to work in concert with indigenous nations, the Government of Quebec and the other governments of Canada to counter the inequities experienced by our minority communities in their relationship with the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know that an important part of reconciliation with indigenous peoples involves joint initiatives to make Quebec and Canada cleaner and more just. Living conditions for some people and in some communities in Quebec and Canada with respect to the environment are unacceptable, and governments must uphold their responsibilities in this regard. Access to drinking water comes to mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Top of mind are our first nations, Métis and Inuit friends. The shame of the profound and indescribable harm done to them by the federal government's laws and decisions dating back to 1867 endures to this day. The federal government's misdeeds haunt us painfully and unremittingly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is difficult for indigenous peoples of Quebec and Canada to heal the wounds that the Government of Canada inflicted on them and, incomprehensibly, continues to inflict on them. Unbelievably, the Indian Act is still with us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Nevertheless, there is hope, because we are all working on a relationship based on recognition, respect and co-operation. There is hope because the Bloc Québécois is working and fighting to make Quebec a country founded on mutual recognition with indigenous nations, a country in which all citizens are equal and everyone reaps the benefits of social and environmental justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While there are increasingly well substantiated links between rising pollution levels and various diseases and developmental disabilities, I would still like to take this opportunity to highlight the longer-term implications of environmental inequities, particularly for the different regions of Quebec. These repercussions are very real. One need only compare the populations of the two sides, west and east, of Montreal Island. Life expectancy on the east side, which is more francophone and very multicultural, is 10 years lower than that on the West Island. That is a sad reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Putting people's quality of life and health at risk puts the development and sustainability of our communities at risk. If we want to avoid environmentally risky industrial projects, we must create mechanisms that ensure the safety and health of citizens. We also need to be mindful of the support that must be provided to organizations that combat some of the negative effects of industrial projects. These elements have been increasingly well documented, and we know that the quality of the environment affects the physical and cognitive development of individuals. For example, there are statistics pointing to a higher incidence of pervasive development disorders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>April 2 is World Autism Awareness Day. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the painstaking and ground-breaking work of Mohamed Ghoul and his team. I have a huge amount of respect for Mohamed and Lucie Beauregard and the organization they run. They work very hard to help people with autism integrate into society, primarily through music. APPROSH is a clinical psychosocial intervention program developed by Mr. Ghoul for young people and adults who have neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Mr. Ghoul has been developing his training program for years and running the Maison-école des artistes autistes &amp; le monde, a place for people with autism to come together and learn. Mr. Ghoul has been recognized around the world for his work, but his programs have been left out of Canada's federal programs. I am mentioning him today because it is important to think big and think about the potential impacts on the well-being of Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Let us come back to Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C‑230</Document>. In order to establish a national strategy to repair the harm caused by what our colleague from Cumberland—Colchester calls environmental racism, this bill provides that the Minister of the Environment consult with representatives from provincial governments, municipal governments, indigenous communities and other communities affected, as well as any other person or entity affected. The purpose would be to gather information and statistics on the location of environmental hazards and the health problems in the most affected communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Bloc Québécois has no problem with everything to that point. However, Bill C‑230 is problematic in that it stipulates that the Government of Canada will assess the administration and enforcement of environmental laws in Quebec. We categorically oppose that because when it comes to the environment, the laws and regulations of the municipalities of Quebec and the Government of Quebec have to apply in Quebec, even though the environment is a shared responsibility. That is indisputable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is more, the Bloc Québécois, through my colleague the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252567" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation>, introduced Bill <Document DbId="10866178" Type="4">C‑225, an act to amend the Aeronautics Act, the Fishing and Recreational Harbours Act and other acts with regard to the application of provincial law</Document>. We wanted the Government of Quebec to have priority, even total sovereignty, on matters of environmental protection on our national territory, but the other political parties opposed us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also introduced another bill, and it too was rejected by a majority of the members of this Parliament. It was in response to another bill that lacked scope and restrictions introduced by the Liberals who, in theory, want us to try to achieve their greenhouse gas reduction targets under the Paris Agreement. We introduced Bill <Document DbId="10866095" Type="4">C‑215, an act respecting Canada’s fulfillment of its greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligations</Document>, sponsored by my hon. colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252929" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation>. This bill wanted to provide the means and some teeth to ensure that the Liberal government met its own commitments on fighting climate change, but it was rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The House of Commons is in no position to lecture Quebeckers about the environment because the parliamentarians of the other political parties are incapable of turning their words into coherent action while respecting provincial jurisdictions. Why is Ottawa again attempting to impose its will to the detriment of the state of Quebec? Furthermore, I would venture to say that for some time Canada has sullied Quebec's exemplary environmental reputation. Therefore, we are saying no to Bill C‑230 primarily because Quebec's social policies are not within the jurisdiction of the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Furthermore, Quebec does not need any lessons from the Canadian government on social policies. A quick look at the history of Quebec and Canada shows how Quebec has long had forward-thinking and high quality social policies that have even been copied by the governments of other Canadian provinces and territories. This is a credit to Quebec, and we are always proud to see our Canadian friends open up to our way of doing things and our way of building a more just society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In closing, there is no doubt in the minds of Bloc Québécois members that Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C‑230, an act respecting the development of a national strategy to redress environmental racism</Document>, is nothing more than another attempt at federal interference, much like the ones we in the Bloc are accustomed to opposing day after day in most of the legislation introduced in the House of Commons. With Bill C‑230, the federal government would no longer be content with disrespecting Quebec's environmental laws. It would assume the right to assess the administration and enforcement of environmental laws in each province. The idea of joint consultations with indigenous nations, Quebec City and Ottawa is certainly a good intention, but it must end with just consultations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Bloc Québécois will not allow the federal government to infringe on areas under the jurisdiction of Quebec and its municipalities. I would like to remind all members of this Parliament that Quebec's territory belongs to Quebec, and it is up to the Government of Quebec and Quebeckers to protect it as they see fit. Once again, Bill C-230 clearly proves that a federal government that seeks to centralize authority has no respect for Quebec's sovereignty and jurisdictions. It is important to remind members of that. It bears repeating over and over because the federal government does not seem to want to hear it: it is up to the Government of Quebec to enforce its own laws, period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will close with brief editorial note. A survey was presented this morning that clearly illustrates how the federal government wants to impose an energy corridor that would run through Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the Gazoduq project. The government wanted to move western Canadian oil through Quebec with energy east, but that project was rejected. It is now trying to move the project somewhere else, where it would affect a population that is perhaps more vulnerable and less involved, the population in northern Quebec, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, in my riding. However, the people of Quebec do not support that project, and I would like the House to take note of that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, over the course of our nation's history, polluting projects have disproportionately been situated in areas adjacent to indigenous and racialized populations, which has led to increased impacts to human health in those communities. This is a reality that we need to confront, as Canadians, to become a more equitable society. I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> for tabling Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>, an act respecting the development of a national strategy to redress environmental racism, which follows similar acts she advocated for as an MLA in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Environmental racism is characterized by the disproportionate exposure of communities of colour to pollution and its associated effects on health and the environment, as well as the unequal environmental protection and environmental quality provided through laws, regulations, governmental programs, enforcement and policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Recently, the issue of environmental racism in Canada was emphasized by the United Nations special rapporteur on toxics and human rights, who visited Canada in 2019 to report on the prevalence of environmental and health discrimination faced by indigenous and marginalized groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Ultimately, he concluded that a pattern exists in Canada in which marginalized groups, and indigenous people in particular, find themselves on the wrong side of a toxic divide and subject to conditions that would not be acceptable elsewhere in Canada. This is the crux of the problem that we face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Canada, this environmental injustice for indigenous and racialized peoples stems in part from our history of colonialism: the lack of diverse representation in decision-making roles, the marginalization of racialized voices, income inequality and the general blind eye that our system over our history turned to negative externalities such as pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Communities of colour, particularly poor communities, have been seen as attractive sites for industrial facilities and other developments that impact the proximate populace because they were seen as cost-effective and efficient. For example, when a decision is made to situate a landfill in a particular location, the surrounding population that has the ability to move, does. However, those who are already at a disadvantage in society, and who do not have the capacity to oppose such projects, are forced to live alongside pollutants that may impact their health and their surrounding environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Environmental inequality is not relegated to decisions of where to site projects alone. Consequences for environmental violations are not uniform. In my home province of British Columbia, the maximum penalties for dumping garbage or waste on Crown land currently have upper limits of $2,000 or $1 million, while the maximum penalty for dumping garbage or waste on Indian reserves is only $100.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In my community, the North Shore Sewage Treatment Plant has sat on the Squamish Nation's Capilano Reserve for the last 55 years. Known for emitting fumes, especially on hot summer days, the plant is situated metres away from the Squamish Nation community despite waste management facilities generating emissions that may be hazardous to human health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Now, with the help of federal and provincial funding, construction of the new Lions Gate Secondary Wastewater Treatment Plant is under way. It will be relocated from the Squamish Nation Reserve to a location in the District of North Vancouver owned by Metro Vancouver. The new treatment plant is being constructed with 100% odour containment, and the old facility's land will be returned to the Squamish Nation for it to redevelop as it sees fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reconstruction of the waste water treatment plant will not only relieve residents of foul odours, but will also provide the north shore with cleaner water and a healthier ecosystem because, while the current plant only removes 50% of organic matter and 70% of suspended solids, the upgraded plant will ensure the elimination of 90% of all waste prior to the sewage entering the sea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The neighbouring Tsleil-Waututh Nation is hopeful that the upgraded plant will help reduce contamination in shellfish harvesting areas both in Burrard Inlet and in Indian Arm. The North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant serves not only as an excellent example of what redressing environmental harm can look like, but also as an example of how varied and extensive the impacts of toxic exposure can be for indigenous and racialized communities, with a sewage plant directly impacting the air of one nation and the food supply of another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Elsewhere in Canada, approximately 90% of Grassy Narrows residents currently suffer from mercury poisoning as a result of Dryden Chemicals dumping mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system between 1962 and 1970. As a result of the dumping, all commercial fishing in the river system has been banned: the fish were shown to contain mercury levels 10 to 50 times higher than in other areas. As such, the Grassy Narrows Nation was not only subjected to severe mercury poisoning, but also to the elimination of the community's main source of income. Despite this clear environmental injustice, it took 50 years for the government to provide the people of Grassy Narrows with an effective remedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another compounding issue is that despite greater exposure levels to hazardous substances, indigenous and racialized peoples have been shown to face further discrimination in health care. As an example, 62% of Grassy Narrows First Nation members living on reserve report barriers to health care. While in many examples we have a painful legacy of environmental racism, our legal frameworks are evolving over time to mitigate the risk of future such examples occurring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For instance, the Impact Assessment Act, which became law in 2019 and replaced the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, greatly increased the standard of public participation and transparency in environmental assessment. It became easier for the public to formally participate in assessments. It introduced a pre-assessment planning phase in which the public could participate to address clear issues such as project siting before the assessment in full began. It greatly enhances the consultation and accommodation process with affected first nations by requiring that this begin in the planning phase. It also incorporates traditional knowledge and creates the conditions for indigenous-led assessments.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>In addition, with the introduction of Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document>, which if passed would implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into federal law, we would take further holistic action on reconciliation. Notably, this would also address environmental racism, as UNDRIP affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to conservation and protection of the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Most importantly, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, or CEPA, is the main piece of legislation we have in Canada to ensure that we protect the environment and human health. However, this legislation has not been substantially updated in over two decades. The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development studied CEPA and delivered a comprehensive report. Among the recommendations were that the government should recognize the right to a healthy environment. It mentioned the importance of considering vulnerable populations and risk assessments, and of developing legally binding and enforceable national standards for drinking water in consultation with provinces, territories, indigenous peoples, stakeholders and the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I look forward to the introduction of a reformed CEPA in due course. If we follow through on these and other suggestions made by the committee, we would go a long way toward addressing future environmental racism in Canada, but there will surely be gaps that remain after all this is done, which is why the bill that we are discussing today is so important in further studying and uncovering where these gaps may lie. The bill would require the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> to collect information about the locations of environmental hazards and information about the negative health outcomes in affected communities, ensuring that the public and the government are informed and aware of the dangers associated with hazardous sites. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The minister would also be required to examine the link between race, socio-economic status and environmental risk, thus examining how race and socio-economic status expose indigenous and other racialized communities to contamination and pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Furthermore, Environment and Climate Change Canada would be required to develop a strategy to address environmental racism and to provide regular reports to Parliament on its progress. Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> would ensure that there is a routine assessment of the extent to which environmental laws are administered and enforced in each province and would promote efforts to amend federal laws, policies and programs in order to address environmental racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To conclude, I believe that this bill will make progress on issues of both environment and equity. I will be voting in favour of sending it to be studied further at committee. At this stage, we can involve the voices of provinces, territories, rights holders and stakeholders from right across the country in its deliberation and to further strengthen it. I invite my colleagues from across this House to do the same.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today about the bill by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation>, Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>, an act respecting the development of a national strategy to redress environmental racism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> proposes to develop a national strategy to address the harm caused by environmental racism, in consultation with provincial and municipal governments and indigenous and other affected communities, persons and bodies. Given the important objectives of the bill, the government supports sending the bill to committee for further study. This would enable a broad discussion to take place on the environmental risks faced by marginalized communities and historically disadvantaged groups, and examine options to develop a strategy that is both practical and appropriate for the federal government. The activities proposed by the bill could help identify and fill knowledge gaps, providing different levels of government with the information needed to work toward addressing issues raised by the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This would build upon the government's commitment to evidence-based decision-making that takes into consideration the impact of policies on all Canadians. The bill is timely and commendable. However, there are three sets of issues that the government is looking forward to discussing and studying at committee, and which the government would seek amendments to address. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>First, a national strategy could serve to promote environmental justice, which is a concept that is already recognized in the bill, as a goal to strive to achieve through a coordinated national strategy. Environmental justice seeks to avoid disproportionate impacts of environmental harm on certain communities, for example, minorities, and includes other grounds of discrimination in addition to race, such as low-income communities and remote communities. Potential amendments would seek to further incorporate principles of environmental justice into the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Second, there are some measures proposed in the bill that are more appropriately taken by provinces. We recognize that jurisdiction over the protection of the environment is shared among different levels of government in Canada and we would seek amendments to address the impacts on provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Third, while the bill contains some important mandatory requirements, a flexible framework for developing a national strategy would be required. Amendments would aim to avoid pre-empting or prejudging the issues and findings of environmental racism that may be identified in the process of developing a national strategy. As I said, the bill deserves our attention and represents the beginning of a conversation that can build upon and complement efforts that our government is undertaking to strengthen environmental protections and to combat systemic racism. As a result, we look forward to careful study at committee and discussions on possible ways to reinforce the bill and its purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Finally, once again I would thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> for bringing this bill forward, for her advocacy and her environmental passion, which are very important in this particular case. I hope that all members will join the government in supporting sending this legislation to committee for further study.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>To everything there is a season, a time and a purpose, and Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> is a bill whose time has come, for we are at a tipping point or, hopefully, a turning point in Canada's history and indeed that of our planet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>For years, grassroots activists across Canada have been fighting for social and environmental justice for indigenous, black and other racialized communities. We stand on the shoulders of community leaders like Chief Dan George, Dr. David Suzuki in B.C., to Dr. Ingrid Waldron, Chief Andrea Paul, Louise Deslisle, Doreen Bernard and Drs. Lynn and Rocky Jones right here in Truro, Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One year ago I introduced Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>, a national strategy to redress environmental racism, in the House of Commons in Ottawa. Then recently, in January of this year, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to develop programs and policies to “address the disproportionate health, environmental, economic, and climate impacts on disadvantaged communities” in the United States. Surely this gives even more credence to the need for Canada to address this issue within our own borders. Therefore, let us do the right thing and acknowledge the injustices of the past by addressing the issues of systemic environmental racism with respect to the pollution of the land, air and water affecting a disproportionate number of indigenous, black and other racialized communities; acknowledging the equal and inherent right of all to clean air and water; meaningfully consulting affected communities; collecting vital data; recommending further action and redress; and embracing environmental justice by honouring, celebrating and protecting the natural environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Research shows that racialized people have higher rates of chronic disease and are more vulnerable to both climate change and new diseases like COVID‑19 due to the long-standing structural inequities that have caused poverty, leading to unstable housing and food insecurity. Environmental racism is a major contributor to these inequities, since a disproportionate number of racialized communities are located in areas that have been exposed to major polluters emitting toxins associated with cancer, respiratory illness and birth defects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have much to learn from indigenous people around the globe, particularly women, as it is often the women who bear the brunt of inequity and are faced with the fallout of environmental racism. It is with this in mind that I honour all grassroots grandmothers and sacred water protectors, the women whose blood, sweat and tears has been spilled endlessly in the spiral of creation, fighting for their lives, their rights, those of their children and, I would add, for Mother Earth. If we are to survive as a species, the way we perceive, value and treat our fellow humans, natural environment and every living thing must change. I would like to believe it is changing with each new generation, as the obvious results of our human flaws and past mistakes become impossible to deny. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>One of the biggest mistakes colonial society has made is the belief that some races and genders are more important or valuable than others and therefore that some peoples and communities are less deserving of a healthy environment than others. Not only is this premise false, but we also seem to have forgotten that we are in fact part of nature ourselves and are all connected to each other and to the natural realm. We are all born with the innate right to clean air and water. These simple elements are vital for our survival. Let us be honest, we have taken both for granted to our own detriment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>My parents taught me long ago that every child is born equal and deserves to be treated with mutual respect. My 97-year-old grandmother, Elizabeth, taught me that without hope we have nothing. The eyes of our children and grandchildren are upon us. Let us give them a reason not only to hope, but to believe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The time to act is upon us. If not us, who? If not now, when? I humbly ask members to support Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am raising an issue today in our adjournment proceedings that I originally raised on November 17 during question period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As an MP, I often reflect on what it means to serve this country. Base Gagetown is located in my riding of Fredericton, and it is with a great sense of pride that I represent so many people who are also serving our country as current and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a distinct moral, social, legal and fiduciary covenant between Canada and the active and retired members of the Canadian Armed Forces. I am here this evening, because I am convinced that the government is not upholding its obligations to those who have sacrificed themselves, their health and their well-being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to draw the parliamentary secretary's attention to a group of brave, driven and hard-working citizens in my riding who call themselves Brats In The Battlefield. They are veterans, children of veterans and private citizens who live in close proximity to our base. They are also victims of the application of pesticides and herbicides in accumulation at Base Gagetown over decades, and they are seeking answers. These individuals have lost too many of their loved ones already. Many are fighting a new battle of health as they confront cancer and other diagnoses that can be linked to chemical exposure. They deserve justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>An independent public inquiry to address exactly what was used and in what quantities would help to uncover the answers these people have been seeking. The government confirmed in a response to their petition that all federal and provincial regulations were followed at the time other than in a few specific cases, but this is not good enough. In fact, it is outrageous. Policies have evolved over time, because we know more about these products than we once did. We need to apply current scientific knowledge to decisions that were made over the last 70 years, so that citizens can know with certainty what they were exposed to and what ongoing risks to their health they face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If the government wants to take seriously its role and responsibility, it would convene a fully independent public inquiry that would make recommendations in relation to the application of pesticides at CFB Gagetown and its surrounding communities from the 1950s to the present day, well beyond the two-year window that was previously studied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A fact-finding project was at one time convened, followed by a health-risk assessment conducted by the chemical industry itself. It should come as no surprise that those affected find little solace in these reports. Furthermore, the public inquiries act clearly states that an independent commissioner must be appointed, and that was never done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The mandate of Veterans Affairs Canada is to support the well-being of veterans and their families. This is an obvious component of that mandate. Members of this brave group not only feel let down, they feel walked on and locked out of the democratic process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Having been born and raised in Oromocto myself, I know that the base is part of our identity. It is the heart of our community's economy. Those who have served there, and their families, deserve justice. I am calling on the government to do the right thing and take a long, hard look at what happened at Base Gagetown, at our ongoing use of herbicides and pesticides and what risks we are willing to take when it comes to human health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I can only pray that these Canadians will still be alive long enough to receive the acknowledgement they deserve and to find peace in the hope that it will never happen again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the member for Fredericton, for her intervention and the work she does to represent veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Although the 2020 season of remembrance was very different than what we are used to because of the pandemic, that did not prevent us from taking a moment to remember our fallen soldiers and those who bravely served to defend the peace and freedom that many Canadians helped protect during all those years.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>We are particularly thankful for the Royal Canadian Legion for the ceremony it led at the National War Memorial and to Canadians for heeding advice to stay home during this difficult time and to celebrate Remembrance Day online. While events around the country were naturally scaled way back, I hope our veterans still felt the enormous appreciation we have for them even if it had to be conveyed differently this past year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>November is a time to reflect, but by no means does our acknowledgement of Canada's veterans limit itself to just a few weeks a year.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>We work all year round to ensure that our veterans receive the support provided by military services and get the assistance they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As we all know, 2020 was a difficult year, especially for veterans and the organizations they tend to turn to for assistance and advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To help veterans, we put in place a $20-million emergency fund for organizations that support veterans just before Remembrance Day. Groups such as the Legion, ANAVETS, VETS Canada, the True Patriot Love Foundation and others have incurred significant deficits because of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>While Legion and ANAVET branches have been able to apply for funding through the Dominion Command, other organizations apply for funding through the Veteran Affairs website at veterans.gc.ca. Through the support fund, we have made money available so that they could continue to operate to provide veterans and their families with the essential services that they count on.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>As for the member's comment on homelessness, I want to say that one homeless veteran is one too many. Veterans, like all other Canadians, deserve safe and affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When Veterans Affairs Canada learns about a veteran experiencing homelessness, the department takes immediate action to give them the support they need and works with its partners to help the individual find appropriate housing. There is also a veterans emergency fund to help them and their families buy food, find housing and stay safe when their well-being is at risk due to a financial emergency. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Finally, it goes without saying that the number of veterans waiting on claims is simply too high, but I want the member opposite, everyone in the House and all Canadians to know that our government is doing everything possible to bring these numbers down and accelerate decision-making. The strategy we introduced last June to reduce wait times included a $192-million funding commitment to keep the 168 decision-makers hired through budget 2018 and to hire another 350 employees dedicated to reducing the wait time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, remembering the sacrifices of veterans is one thing. Responding to their current urgent needs is another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If I may, here is a list of presumptive diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure, some of which Canadian veterans and their families are grappling with: chronic lymphatic leukemia, soft tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, chloracne, respiratory cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, early-onset transient peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, type 2 diabetes, and spina bifida in offspring of exposed individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Agent White and Agent Purple were also sprayed in my community, along with glyphosate and DDT. Citizens were told these chemicals were just about safe enough to drink. Workers cleared fallen brush with their bare hands, fresh after a spray, while the children played in smoke clouds behind the application trucks. The contracted companies wanted to save a few bucks by cutting corners and increasing chemical concentrations. Now it is these citizens who are paying the price.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here this evening to take part in the adjournment debates, which are always very interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I asked the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> when the next federal budget would be tabled. They let the cat out of the bag today: it will be on April 19. Canadians have been waiting two years, and the federal government will finally deign to present them with a budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is important to remember that the 10 Canadian provinces and all G7 countries have been transparent with their people. They have not been afraid to table budgets despite the pandemic and its attendant inconveniences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When I asked my question, I said that if a family went to a bank to ask for a loan but refused to produce its financial statements, the bank would of course say no. The problem with the Liberal government is that, when it goes to the bank to ask for a loan, it approves its own request. Naturally, we are very afraid that, in the upcoming budget, it will respond to its own request very generously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We already know that the Liberal government has asked to increase Canada's debt ceiling by $663 billion—not $663 million, mind you, but $663 billion—without presenting a plan to Canadians, a plan to reopen our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We often wonder why the government is waiting until April 19 before presenting Canadians with its first budget in two years. To me, the answer is quite simply that the government is not ready. It wants to present a budget once a majority of the population was vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Unfortunately, because of past bad decisions, because of a bad vaccine procurement agreement with a Chinese company, and after putting all its eggs in one basket and being unable to procure vaccines before or at least at the same time as the other G7 countries, we are now lagging behind. That is why we learned today that the next federal budget will be brought down on April 19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>What do we expect to find in that budget?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We expect to find a plan to reopen the economy that will rely above all on vaccinating the majority of Canadians. Unfortunately, we know that we will not be able to meet that objective at the same time as the other countries, because the government procrastinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, other measures definitely need to be implemented. The next budget should have fewer slogans and a lot more money for workers and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is important to protect jobs, especially during this period of economic recovery. Now is not the time to reimagine our economy, as we have heard the Prime Minister say so often. It is time to place our trust in the stable and traditional jobs that have existed in Canada for a long time, because those people deserve to get their jobs back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The post-pandemic period is not the time to choose who will be the winners and losers, which workers will be favoured by a government and which ones will be overlooked during the next few years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is important for the next budget to send a clear message to all Canadian workers, especially women who were seriously impacted by the recent pandemic, such as those working in health care, retail and all highly affected sectors that had to close their doors, that their government has not forgetten them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are expecting a true economic recovery plan in the April 19 budget. The minister is promising the budget of her life. Given her past performance, I am immensely worried for the future of my grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am a little saddened that I do not see the hon. member's usual photo of the House of Commons behind him, as it is a good reminder of where we would all like to be in person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue. As the member mentioned, the budget will be delivered on April 19. I do take objection to his comments that we are not providing a level of transparency. As he knows, the finances of the government, and the expenditures, are done through the estimates process, which he has participated in in his various committees. As well, there was a fall economic statement delivered back in the fall. It is now spring, and we are still debating the implementation bill of the previous economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am hoping that as we move forward, in terms of the budget, we will have a more rapid debate so that we can deliver the types of programs that we have been delivering to Canadians to help them. That is what it is going to take to allow us to come rolling back after COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have been there for the nearly nine million Canadians who have accessed the CERB, more than 850,000 businesses that have accessed CEBA, the more than 5.2 million employees whose wages were supported by the emergency wage subsidy, and the more than 143,000 organizations that have used the rent subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have been there for them from the start, and we will continue to be there for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are already seeing the results. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Canadian economy grew by more than 10% annualized. That is better than what we saw from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy. Furthermore, employment recovered nearly all the ground lost in the second wave with the unemployment rate at its lowest since March 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is good news. It shows that we have done exactly what need to be done. We have been deliberate, prudent and responsible. We have sought to be transparent with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Last July, we presented the economic and fiscal snapshot, which provided predictions for the economic situation on that. As I mentioned, building upon that, in November we presented the fall economic statement, which included even more extensive financial information and projections. We have offered an extensive five-year fiscal forecast, which took into account varying scenarios.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The hon. member mentioned vaccines. We are well on our way. We had promised Canadians six million vaccines by the end of March. We are missing that target, and instead are exceeding it by more than 50%. We are well on our way to 37 million doses by the end of June, and more than enough to vaccinate everyone by the end of summer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his kind words about my background when I am in my riding office. It is a reminder that the House must work for the good of all Canadians and take all Canadians into consideration. Now is not the time to capitalize on a post-pandemic economic recovery, after everyone has suffered. It is not the time to think up new methods and to pick winners and losers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My colleague mentioned the economic statement. He was very careful to avoid saying we have gone two years without a budget, while many other governments and countries have presented budgets to their citizens. This is important, and it is also important that the next budget focus on the economic recovery so that all Canadians can have equal opportunities to succeed and get ahead. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I will begin by acknowledging that I am speaking from the traditional territory of the WSÁNEC Nation, which is among the Coast Salish nations of southern Vancouver Island. <I>Hych'ka Siem</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I also want to start by congratulating my hon. colleague, although I am not sure if I should congratulate him since he was already the parliamentary secretary for transport. Now he gets to debate me in the late show, because he is the parliamentary secretary for environment and climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The question I asked of the hon. <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> on December 8 related to Canada essentially exercising the loophole on our shipment of plastic waste to other countries. Long ago, we entered into the Basel Convention on hazardous waste, which prevents the export of hazardous waste to other countries except under certain conditions and with their prior, informed consent. In our move to eliminate ocean plastics, Canada and countries around the world worked to amend the Basel Convention such that plastics on their way to be recycled in other countries could be treated on different levels: as hazardous materials or acceptable for shipment to other countries. At a certain level, annex II plastic waste requires prior and informed consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The problem here, as I put it to the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> on December 8, is that Canada has entered into an agreement with the United States, which has never ratified the Basel Convention. It is not a party to the convention, and that has created a loophole allowing the U.S. to send non-conforming plastic waste to other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> answered my question by confirming that the United States is not a party to the Basel Convention, which was part of my question, and then he went on to say that the agreement between Canada and the United States dealt with waste vis-à-vis our two countries. However, that does not deal with the U.S. exporting further to non-OECD countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is an increased level of concern about Canada exploiting this potential loophole, and there are things we could do about it. We could ensure that we amend our agreement with the United States to specify that it must deal exclusively with non-hazardous plastic waste as scheduled under annex IX of the Basel Convention. We could ratify the Basel ban ourselves to ensure that no plastic waste is exported to non-OECD countries. We could extend our manufactured plastic waste strategy under schedule 1 of CEPA to actually enact our ban on single-use, non-essential plastic. We could expand our integrated management plan and our approach for plastic products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is much more we could do to ensure that the side agreement Canada has executed with the United States creates all the same protections for the export of plastic products from Canada to the United States as would be the case if the United States has ratified the Basel Convention. We are not able to say that today. There is more to be done to ensure there is no loophole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While on the subject of plastic waste, I think we need to expand beyond single-use plastics to look at polystyrene, which has many uses in a marine context. Wharves and buoys break down very quickly. These bits of styrofoam, or polystyrene, in our waters and on our beaches are a real threat to marine life, but they are not necessarily categorized as single-use products. They are more durable, but they break down. They are really a threat. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, Canada played a leadership role in the negotiation of the Basel amendments on plastic waste during the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention and supported their adoption. Canada considers these amendments as very important, as they are key to strengthening controls on exports of certain plastic waste, leading to cleaner trade of plastic waste globally and contributing to a reduction of marine litter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am very pleased to inform the House that Canada accepted the amendments on December 29, 2020. As a result, since January 1, 2021, Canadian exporters must obtain export permits to be able to export these plastic wastes to parties to the convention. The consent of the importing country is required before an export permit will be issued. All partes to the convention have now accepted these important amendments, except for Turkey. This means that a global framework for controlling the transboundary movement of these plastic wastes is now in place. This represents an important safeguard to allow parties to deny the import of plastic waste subject to the convention, including prohibiting imports from non-parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The fact is that the Basel Convention states that parties to the convention wanting to trade waste subject to the convention with a non-party must enter into an agreement with that country that is a non-legally binding instrument or that is a legally binding instrument. Both non-legally binding and legally binding instruments can satisfy the requirements of the convention. Such instruments must respect the obligations of the convention, and the traded waste must be managed in an environmentally sound manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As we know, the U.S. is not a party to the Basel Convention. Basel parties around the world can allow imports of plastic waste covered by the convention from the U.S. only if they have entered into an arrangement or agreement with the U.S., as required by the convention. Since Canada trades plastic waste with the United States, and in accordance with its obligation under Basel, Canada concluded an arrangement with the United States for the environmentally sound management of non-hazardous waste traded between the two countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The arrangement applies between only Canada and the United States. Plastic waste covered by the Basel Convention and destined to a party to the convention is subject to Canadian regulation and requires an export permit, which will only be granted if the importing party consents to the import. This is the case even if the waste ships through the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is no free pass for exports of controlled plastic waste from Canada to Basel parties when going through the United States, securing a commitment that non-hazardous waste traded between Canada and the U.S. is and will continue to be managed in an environmentally sound manner, as is at the heart of this arrangement. This arrangement is based upon the legislative and other measures put in place by the countries and, as such, is consistent with the Basel Convention provisions and allows trade to continue freely between our countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is significant environmental gains in allowing plastic waste to move freely across the Canada-U.S. border. These include access to feedstock for recycling operations in Canada, recycling in the U.S. of plastic waste that would otherwise be landfilled in Canada and reduced incentives to export overseas. Canada's ratification of the Basel plastic waste amendments, along with the arrangement with the United States, mean that vulnerable countries can refuse to accept Canadian exports of plastic waste. It also fosters enhanced recycling in Canada and reduces plastic waste that can be sent to a landfill site in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="272431" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> will not be surprised if I continue to maintain that Canada has not taken every step it needs to take and is capable of taking under the Basel Convention in order to ensure that bilateral trade with the United States is not just fully compliant with Basel, but goes beyond it, to ensure there are no loopholes for Canada's plastic waste, especially that which could be considered hazardous, from being exported to non-OECD countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do want to make a more general statement that the notion that plastic can be recycled is largely dubious. A lot of Canadians separate their waste and want to see it recycled. Glass, aluminum, paper and paper products are largely of value and these materials are recycled, but plastic materials degrade very quickly. There is very limited access to actual recycling it. We need to take control of the matter and make sure we move off—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, Canada is committed to ensuring that exports of plastic waste have regulations. That is why we have accepted and implemented the Basel Convention amendments on plastic waste. Canada and the U.S. have measures in place for the environmentally sound management of that waste. We are leveraging the mechanism available under the Basel Convention to continue to trade with the U.S. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The arrangement between Canada and the U.S. does not override regulatory obligations on Canadian exporters. Any waste covered by the convention shipped from Canada to a party to the Basel Convention is subject to our regulation and requires prior consent. Our government is acting responsibly by ensuring that countries consent to imports while fostering recycling and reducing plastic waste landfilling.</ParaText>
