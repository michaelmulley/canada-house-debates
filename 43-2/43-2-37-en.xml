              <ParaText id="6379528">Throughout the pandemic, charities have continued to step up and provide much-needed services to those in need, including food banks and homeless shelters. However, right now across Canada, donations are down and Canadian charities are struggling to raise much-needed funds during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379529">The bill would help charities by waiving the capital gains tax on an arm's-length sale of private shares or real estate when the proceeds of that sale are donated to a charity. This change would allow these kinds of donations to receive tax treatment similar to what public shares currently receive when donated to a charity. This common-sense and much-needed legislation would help struggling charities and give Canadians greater opportunities to give back. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379537">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to table a petition today on behalf of residents from Denman Island and Hornby Island in the Salish Sea. It is timely, especially since a new report cites that only 26% of Canada's wild fish population can be considered healthy, which is down a full 8% since 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379538">The petitioners note the announcement by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans that the Pacific herring population dropped by approximately a third from 2016 to 2019. The forecast for 2020 is 58,000 tonnes, down from 129,000 tonnes in 2016. Herring is the basis of the food web that supports wild Pacific salmon, killer whales, humpback whales, cod, halibut, seabirds and other independent species.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379539">The petitioners call upon on the government to suspend the 2020 Salish Sea herring fishery until a whole-of-ecosystem plan is developed to fairly compensate local fishers for economic losses and ensure that decisions are made with full participation of first nations and local communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379541">The bill would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad to receive an organ that had been harvested from an unwilling person. It would also amend immigration law to create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if that person had been involved in organ harvesting and trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379542"> A bill like this almost passed in the last Parliament, but we ran out of time at the end. The petitioners are hoping that this Parliament will be the one that finally gets the job done.</ParaText>

I am very much in support of our government's commitment to making Canada a net-zero nation by 2050, because the urgency to act on the global climate crisis is real and the challenge of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is also an opportunity to build back our economy more competitively, more sustainably and more inclusively.

              <ParaText id="6379563">That is particularly true for those who have been especially hard hit by COVID-19 and the recession: women, youth, indigenous communities, immigrants, racialized people, people with disabilities, rural communities and northern communities, where I live. It is also true for so many workers and communities that are directly affected by the rapid transformation of the global energy sector, which is why creating good, well-paying jobs in the low-carbon economy is essential. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379564">It is essential that we build a sustainable and prosperous future for Canada and all Canadians. How do we do that? This is the question that lingers in the minds of many who support the initiatives we have introduced around climate change. How can we do more? How do we play a larger role?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379565">A key starting place is to ensure workers have the right skills to succeed in the clean growth economy. As most know, I am a huge supporter of alternate energy development, but I am also a big supporter of the resource development sector in Canada, especially the mining industry. I know many of these companies are working hard to invest properly to ensure they have a clean growth economy. They are looking at alternatives for fuelling and powering their operations and reducing their carbon footprints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379566">For example, we are working with communities and workers who have been affected by the phasing out of coal-fired electricity, with meaningful action to diversify their economies and create new jobs. One way we are doing this is with $185 million in new federal funding to support coal-dependent communities, including $35 million for skills development and economic diversification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379567">Our government not only set targets and adapted a vigorous agenda around clean energy and climate change, but it is making the investments available so people, communities and companies can move forward in Canada to ensure that these happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379568">The remainder of some $150 million within the Government of Canada is now earmarked for new infrastructure projects, and so far this year we have invested more than $22 million in 36 projects across Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. This funding has supported economic diversification initiatives in Leduc and Hanna, Alberta; a solar installation training program at Southeast College in Estevan, Saskatchewan; and similar projects in Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379569"> Right here in my hometown of Mary's Harbour, we are developing alternate energy to support and reduce the use of diesel generation in rural communities like the one I live in. This year, with a partnership from the federal government, we are the first remote community in Labrador to be able to combine hydro power and solar power to supplement, and reduce our dependency on, diesel and reduce our carbon footprint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379570">We are looking forward to doing projects like this in all communities that have become entirely dependent on diesel and move them off diesel dependency. This would include projects like the Glencore smelter and the Trevali closure diversification initiative in northern New Brunswick. We helped Ignite Labs in Nova Scotia, and we also announced that we were moving forward with the Atlantic loop. The Atlantic loop will connect surplus clean power to regions that are moving away from coal. It is a classic win-win that makes electricity more affordable as we create new jobs for workers and their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379571">I live in a region in Labrador that is one of the largest generators of hydro power. The Atlantic loop provides an opportunity for us to continue to fuel the economy with clean energy through massive development projects, such as those at Gull Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379572">We are looking forward to the opportunities this provides, not just for Newfoundland and Labrador and Atlantic Canada, but for all Canadians. We see it as a real win-win situation and are happy that the Government of Canada, our government, is moving forward with the Atlantic loop.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379581">Energy efficiency is another example. By working with Canadians to retrofit their homes with better windows, appliances and insulation, and with smarter grids and building codes, they are seeing the benefits of the energy transition in their own homes. The benefits include lower monthly utility bills and more comfortable homes, all while creating thousands of good jobs and dramatically reducing our emissions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379582">Here is a theme I keep coming back to: creating good, green jobs as we drive environmental performance. That has been central to our government’s economic response to COVID-19, including more than $1.7 billion to help clean up orphan and inactive oil and gas wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. This investment is helping as many as 10,000 hard-working Canadians to find ways to put their skills to use, while demonstrating Canadian leadership on climate change and environmental stewardship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379583">For the same reason, we have announced a new $750-million emissions reduction fund, $320 million to assist the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore industry and $100 million for the Clean Resource Innovation Network. This funding will help make Canada’s oil and gas sector the cleanest in the world, so that good energy jobs are also green energy jobs and so that our move toward a net-zero economy leaves no one behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379584">We recognize the vital role that Canada’s petroleum sector plays here at home and around the world. We are investing in these communities to help them achieve their net-zero targets while ensuring their long-term success. We also recognize the need to nurture talent in the oil and gas sector. We are working with industry, provinces and territories to transform this key pillar of Canada’s economy. Further, we are making other generational investments to bring together economic growth and environmental protection. This includes new funding for smart grids, carbon capture and storage, and the next wave of batteries, made right here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379585">We are creating good jobs in wind and solar energy, and emerging sources of clean energy such as tidal and geothermal. We have put together a made-in-Canada action plan for small modular reactors and a strategy for Canada to become a global leader in the clean production of hydrogen. We will drive the clean growth economy by making zero-emissions vehicles more affordable and investing in more charging stations across the country. </ParaText>

This fair and just transition will be smart and inclusive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379587">Our recent Speech from the Throne doubled down on our promise to exceed our Paris commitments by the end of this decade and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It also launched our campaign to create over one million jobs, restoring employment to pre-pandemic levels and higher.

              <ParaText id="6379618">Canada's climate is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet's. In our northern regions, it is warming three times faster. We can see the effects of that warming in many parts of Canada, and they will only intensify over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379619">These changes have many consequences. For example, scientists expect higher average precipitation in most of Canada. The availability of fresh water is changing, and the likelihood of water shortages in the summer is growing. A warmer climate will intensify some extreme weather conditions, such as heat waves and floods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379620"> Canadians are already feeling the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, including the increasing intensity and frequency of flooding, storms, fires, coastal erosion, extreme heat events, melting permafrost and rising sea levels.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379622">Reaching net zero by 2050 is vitally important to mitigating the risks of climate change, not only for Canada but on a global scale. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that meeting that target is essential if we want to limit global temperature increases to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and reduce the risks associated with climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379623">Limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C is especially important because it will have a considerable impact on the effects of climate change on all fronts, compared to a potential global temperature increase of 2°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379624">Limiting warming to 1.5°C would give us additional options to adapt to the effects of climate change. When Canada ratified the Paris Agreement, it committed to setting and communicating its ambitious national objectives and undertaking ambitious national measures to mitigate climate change in order to meet them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379625">I would like to remind members that the Paris Agreement seeks to strengthen efforts to hold the increase in the average global temperature to well below 2°C and, if possible, to limit it to 1.5°C. Currently, Canada's nationally determined contribution, communicated in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is its target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The government is determined to meet this target, and even exceed it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379626">The government has also committed to developing a plan to set Canada on a path to achieve a prosperous net-zero-emissions future by 2050, supported by public participation, including provincial and territorial governments as well as expert advice. Canadians know full well that climate change threatens their health, their way of life and the planet. They want climate action now, and that is what the government will continue to do by immediately introducing a plan that will enable Canada to exceed its 2030 climate targets and legislation that will aim for net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379627">Before the government can reach its net-zero targets, it must first engage in a process that takes into account the considerations of the populations most affected by climate change. Although Canada's indigenous peoples and northern communities are exceptionally resilient, they are also particularly vulnerable because of such factors as their remoteness and inaccessibility, the cold climate, aging and ineffective infrastructure, and reliance on diesel-based systems to generate electricity and heat homes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6379628">That is why the government is determined to move forward with the approach based on the recognition of rights reflected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In fact, the government will introduce a bill to implement the declaration by the end of the year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379629">The government is also committed to strengthening its collaboration with Canada's indigenous peoples when it comes to climate mitigation measures. This commitment builds on existing initiatives. The government is contributing financially and collaborating on first nations, Métis and Inuit projects to monitor climate change in indigenous communities, build resilient infrastructure, prepare and implement climate change adaptation strategic plans or even develop green energy options that will help reduce dependence on diesel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379630">The plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 would also contribute to making the Canadian economy more resilient, more inclusive and more competitive. With a view to creating a stronger and resilient Canada in the wake of this pandemic, climate action will be the cornerstone of our plan to support and create one million jobs across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379631">Regardless of the global challenges associated with the current pandemic, climate change continues to worsen, and there is little doubt that 2020 will be one of the warmest years on record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379632">It is important to recognize that climate change is a global problem that requires an immediate response from all governments in Canada, as well as from industry, non-governmental organizations and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379633">However, the government recognizes the important collective and individual efforts that have already been made and wants to support this momentum to mitigate climate change. For example, as of 2024, the Société de transport de Sherbrooke will be using new electric buses with a view to completely replacing its bus fleet to make it green. I congratulate the municipal council and Marc Denault, chair of the STS board of directors, for this initiative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379634">I also want to mention the important work of the Conseil régional de l'environnement de l'Estrie and of Jacinthe Caron, whom I have met several times. They are behind several green projects including the Embarque Estrie platform, which identifies public and active transportation options in the region on a web map. This type of initiative shows that it is possible to make a collective contribution to climate change mitigation and to work together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379635">Furthermore, not too long ago, the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> jointly announced a $100-million investment in the clean resource innovation network to support research and development projects that advance the environmental and economic performance of the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379636">Working across government will be an important part of our efforts to mitigate climate change. That is why the <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act</Document> provides for consultations with federal ministers having duties and functions relating to the measures that may be taken to achieve the greenhouse gas reduction targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379637">The Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act will further our efforts to mitigate climate change by setting national climate change mitigation targets based on the best available science and by promoting transparency and accountability in relation to achieving those targets. Concretely, this bill will create a legally binding process to set and achieve climate targets, and require assessment reports, climate plans and examinations by the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379638">This bill will help Canada achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and meet our international climate change mitigation commitments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379656">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to participate in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, a bill that does absolutely nothing for the environment. By way of analogy, I want to explain a little about what the bill actually does and what it does not do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379657">In 2015, Stephen Harper passed balanced budget legislation as part of the budget. The idea was that he would put in place a law that would require the government to, in most situations, run a balanced budget. That was a good idea and one that was advanced by many fiscal Conservatives who believed on principle that if there were a law in place requiring governments to run balanced budgets, they would be much more likely to balance budgets going forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379658">The problem was that in 2016 the Liberals came in. Every time a budget is passed, a new law is also passed. Therefore, what did they do? They repealed the balanced budget law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379659">In my province of Alberta we had a balanced budget law in place that was actually repealed by another premier of that same political stripe. The idea is certainly desirable, that we might have legislation in place that would bind the actions of future governments. It might have some rhetorical impact, but it only goes so far, insofar as a subsequent government, or maybe even a subsequent group of people from the same party, could repeal or slightly amend the legislation in order to allow them to continue on the course they are on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379660">The parliamentary secretary is reminding me that I am splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252818" Type="2">Edmonton Riverbend</Affiliation>. I want to thank the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader for being so helpful all the time. I look forward to further feedback from him as we go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379661">It was at least credible as an exercise for a government that was already running a balanced budget to put in place balanced budget legislation. Imagine how absurd it would be if today we had a government that was not running a balanced budget and had no intention of running a balanced budget, putting in place legislation to require a government in 2040 to run a balanced budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379662">That would be a little silly. It would demonstrably be an excuse for not having a plan. It would be putting in place legislation to bind a future government to have a plan that it does not currently have, recognizing full well that the future government could repeal the law that required it to have a plan, or at least extend it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379663">This brings me then to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, a bill that does not present a plan for action for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is simply a framework by which the government would put in place a plan that it would be expected to follow by achieving certain targets at certain distant points in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379664">I have no problem supporting a bill that calls on government to act, to put in place targets and act on those targets in response to future events as we move forward. However, it should not escape members of the House that we have yet another case in another important policy area where, instead of putting forward an action plan, the government is choosing symbolism. It is choosing statement over substance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379665">The Liberal government has been in place for five years and we still do not have anything like a serious environmental plan. Instead, what we see from the government are warm words, attempts to demonstrate its feeling and solidarity and aspirations for distant dates. What frustrates me about the issue of the environment is that we have serious challenges in terms of our environment. They require a serious response, a response that understands the opportunities and the trade-offs, and that makes choices today about how we move forward toward the realization of targets that have been put in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379666">Imposing new taxes is not going to cut it. That is the Liberals' approach. When they are talking about action, they are talking about putting in place new taxes. The new taxes on Canadian industry and Canadian activity only is simply going to chase jobs and opportunity beyond our borders. If the Liberals succeed, as it seems they are intent on doing, in shutting down our energy sector, those investments will still happen. Global demand for energy is going up. People need energy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6379667"> The question is not if we can shut off our use of energy. The question is if we can find ways of producing energy and delivering energy that are more efficient and more effective. Can we provide that quality of life to people around the world who require an increase in the use of energy, but do it in a way that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379668">If we recognize that the problem is not going to be solved by reducing the use of energy, and that it is only going to be solved, generally speaking, by increasing the efficiency of energy production, that should push us not only to lead in the production of energy that is clean, efficient and effective, but also to lead in a way that recognizes the existing technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379669">It is great to talk about wind, solar and other alternative sources of energy, but we have to recognize as well where the existing technology is today and how we can make concrete, meaningful improvements to the use of existing technology that providing energy to people right now to meet their energy needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379670">That is why I believe that a real environmental plan should be pro-Canadian and pro-Canadian energy. We should encourage the development of Canadian energy, and we should also encourage our energy sector to continue on the road they are on, in terms of improving efficiency, improving effectiveness and delivering more energy to more people in an efficient way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379671">We have colleagues in this House from all other parties who, frankly, attack the development of pipelines, who attack efforts to find new markets for Canadian energy. We know, by and large, that the issue for them is not really about the transportation. It is generally about wanting to shut down the production of that energy, but they do not think about what will replace Canadian energy if we shut it down. It is going to be energy from other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379672">A member from the NDP was just attacking the Keystone XL project. We have had other members attack other projects in this place. It was the Liberal government that imposed arbitrary regulations, which killed the Energy East pipeline project.

This would be a great vision for environmental improvement and economic development, not to shut down our energy sector, but to mobilize and unleash our energy sector as an engine for technological development that can actually respond to the challenges of climate change and other environmental challenges that we see around the world.

              <ParaText id="6379686">I would also like to take this opportunity to ask him why he and his party refuse to support energy transition measures by investing in green technologies that could help create green jobs in his province and for his constituents. When I say “green technologies”, I am not talking about oil. In fact, if I may comment briefly on the Keystone XL pipeline, I would remind him that even the Americans do not want it. President-elect Joe Biden has been quite clear on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379687">Madam Speaker, it is an important question to respond to: What is the future potential of the energy sector in Canada? It is important for the member to know that while there is an economic impact, no doubt, of fluctuations in the oil price, investors understand that oil prices go up and oil prices go down and investments are significantly informed by an assessment of the long-term confidence they can have in that market. That is why, even when oil prices have been low, we have seen significant investments made in the energy sector in other jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379688">We have a particular challenge here in Canada and that has to do with market access. It has to do with the fact that there are great energy projects that make it most of the way through the process, but then Liberal MPs publicly lobby cabinet to kill those projects and they are not able to proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379689">We have a challenge in Canada facing the energy sector, but it is not a problem of price because the price is always fluctuating and decisions are made on long-term horizons. The problem we have is politics. I have been told by ambassadors that Canada is seen as a country with political risk when it comes to investment in the sector. It is not a technical problem. It is a political problem.</ParaText>

In fact, the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy has projected that by 2050 and in the years leading up to 2050, it will cost between $21 billion and $43 billion a year.

Conservatives agree that we should work toward that 2050 net-zero target, but the difference between our parties is that New Democrats seem to believe that the way to get there is to shut down highly productive parts of our economy and simply allow that energy to be produced in less clean, less effective ways in other parts of the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379693">Conservatives do not believe that we should get to net zero by shutting down our economy. We believe we should work toward that goal by technological improvement through things like carbon capture and storage and green technologies that can work within and in concert with our energy sector to address the challenges we face, while providing people all over the world with the energy that they vitally need.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6379694">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to join members from beautiful Edmonton Riverbend, albeit it is a little snowy here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379695"> I am pleased to participate in the debate to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>. I want to start specifically by addressing how bills like this impact my home province of Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379696">Most Canadians are aware of how tough the times have been here in Alberta over the past several years. Thousands upon thousands of jobs have been lost in the energy sector and my city of Edmonton has an unemployment rate of over 12%. Calgary is about the same. These two cities already had some of the highest unemployment rates in the country before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has made the situation even worse. Unfortunately, many businesses will not reopen and many Albertans will have no jobs to return to after the pandemic is over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379697">Why have times been so tough for Alberta? Federal government legislation that appeared designed to decimate the energy industry and rapidly deplete the oil and gas industry has been introduced. Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> overhauled federal environmental assessment processes for construction projects, effectively deterring investment in Alberta. Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> bars oil tankers from loading at ports in northern B.C., making it impossible to export Alberta oil to new markets. On top of all that, we suffered through a regulatory attack like no other from the Notley NDP government, which really set us back decades. Just as all this was occurring, the government announced a new clean fuel standard, which is yet another blow to Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379698"> Honestly, it will be impossible for Alberta to fully recover, with yet more regulation that makes our province unattractive to investors. Our leading-edge energy industry will not be competitive against other countries if we have so many regulations tacked on by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379699">To help counteract this attack, the Alberta government just launched a natural gas strategy that would see the province become a leader in hydrogen production and liquefied natural gas for export. Natural gas will be regulated under the clean fuel standard. No other jurisdiction in the world is applying this type of standard to liquefied natural gas. However, the clean fuel standard will once again exacerbate the economic depression, as reported by Canadians for Affordable Energy, which estimates this standard will cause 30,000 job losses nationally and at least $20 billion of capital will leave Canada. Alberta will disproportionately experience this loss, but all Canada will be impacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379700">I agree with my colleagues across the aisle that it is well intentioned to strive toward net-zero emissions. However, we do differ on how to get there. Harnessing the energy sector and its talent is, in my opinion, key to meeting that target. We must include energy industry stakeholders when developing any environmental plans. From what we have been hearing initially on Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the government has failed to do just that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379701">At the end of the day, climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution. For decades more, the world will continue to use oil and gas. The question then becomes as to whether energy will come from democratic countries like Canada with strong environmental protections or from dictatorships with no environmental protections or respect for human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379702">Domestic energy production, including oil and gas, is an important part of making our country more self-reliant and more resilient in the future. In today's world, we cannot afford to become reliant on energy from any other countries and, quite honestly, we have no need to. Getting to net-zero emissions in the energy industry requires a plan, not just a plan to have a plan. What we see here is a mission to develop a plan in the future and the government's plan is already being poked full of holes. The focus could have been on harnessing energy and the use of technologies from sources such as nuclear and wind carbon capture, with the government providing incentives similar to those that were used to stimulate the early development of the oil sands. Many governments have a long record of practical and successful environmental initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379703">Under our previous Conservative government, Canada successfully tackled acid rain, expanded national parks and removed dangerous chemicals from the biosphere. We must persevere on our shared environment for future generations without sacrificing the jobs Canadians need today or damaging the economic engine that helps fund our vital social programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379704">Our recent report from the Canada Energy Regulator found that, even with policies in place to curb emissions, oil and gas will still make up two-thirds of energy sources in 2050. This report also found that there will be increased demand for natural gas, which I mentioned before as a fuel that will become more heavily regulated under the clean fuel standard. This is again a deterrent for investors in foreign markets. We have an opportunity to help with emissions globally, by being part of the switch from coal-fired plants in Asia and other parts of the world to natural gas, a much cleaner form of energy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6379705">Exporting our natural gas, technology and talent to other parts of the world will go a long way in the fight against climate change. Removing coal-fired plants makes a huge dent in emissions globally. We all agree everyone has a role to play in tackling climate change and Canada is no exception, but aggressively regulating our energy industry when there is still known demand for its products is short-sighted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379706">We can do more good globally by using our technologies in oil and gas to help tackle climate change both abroad and in Canada than by abruptly shutting it down. Natural gas is a huge opportunity for Canada to be a world player in other markets. More excessive regulation by the federal government not only hinders this opportunity but threatens the livelihoods of many Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379707">The bill before us would set targets to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. This is a laudable goal and I want to be clear it is one I fully support, but it is once again a big shiny object over here being used to distract Canadians when the government cannot be clear on what the vision of its plan is to get there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379708">Is this a bill to strike a 12-person committee? If it is, then be honest and tell us that. Do not promise this is a visionary piece of legislation that requires three ministers to walk across an open field that some communications person somewhere decided would make good optics to distract the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379709">We see the government continue to make new environmental commitments, while still failing to meet its previous climate promises. The government's own projections show it is not even close to meeting its current commitments, yet it is setting new targets that are higher and even further into the future. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Canada is on track to significantly miss its 2030 emissions commitments. What about the two billion trees promised in the last election? I have not seen a single tree planted by these guys. Actually, there is not even a plan to plant a tree, let alone a budget to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379710">I, for one, would really like to work with my colleagues across the aisle to produce a comprehensive plan to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and to meet net-zero emissions by 2050. I have kids and I desperately want their future to include a safe and healthy environment. It is hard to support the government when it delivers an optical illusion of a plan that continues to include more regulations and taxes that hurt our economy by deterring investment in Canada. Life has become more expensive for Canadians as a result. Eventually Canadians are going to ask, “At what cost?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379711">I truly believe here in Canada we can develop a plan that harnesses the technology and brainpower of our energy industry to help other countries transition to energy sources that are much less harmful to the environment. We can make Canada and Canadian energy independent instead of importing oil from countries with brutal regimes and human rights abuses. We can remove regulations and red tape, and at the same time make Canada more attractive for international investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379712">I am here and fully on board with achieving a net-zero goal. We can do this by creating a comprehensive plan and policies. We simply need the government to work with us in opposition as opposed to continually pretending to the world it cares without any necessary targets required. I plead to the government to please consider working with us, especially at the environment committee, to strengthen the bill so we get it right for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379732">I have a number of thoughts that I would like to share with the House in regard to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, noting that the government's first priority and focus continues to be on the pandemic. There should be no doubt about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379733">It has been interesting as we have been dealing with legislation over the last couple of weeks and today. Once again, we are bringing forward somewhat historic legislation, this time dealing with a very important issue related to the environment, of which I know Canadians, as a whole, would be very supportive. I am absolutely confident of that fact. However, when we look back at the legislative agenda and the types of legislation we have brought forward. I find interesting to witness some of the voting that takes place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379734">For example, related to the pandemic, we had the wage loss and rent assistance program legislation, which was critically important. It received the unanimous support in the House and was passed. It was considered in committee, it went through third reading, was sent to the Senate and received royal assent. That is good news for small businesses in all regions of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379735">Then we have this legislation, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>. It seems there are different attitudes on this bill. In listening to the Conservative critic, I believe the Conservative Party will support the legislation going to committee. On the other hand, it was interesting hearing the former leader of the Green Party say that she would not be supporting the legislation. The NDP and the Bloc will support the legislation going to committee at least.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379736">Therefore, on the surface, it seems that we recognize the value and the importance of this legislation. It was really quite encouraging when the minister indicated to all members of the House, like other ministers, that if the opposition wanted to be constructive and work collaboratively with the government, the government was very open to ideas and ways to make the legislation even better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379737">However, let us be very clear. If we look at the last federal election, the leader of the Liberal Party, today's <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, indicated that we wanted to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and that we would bring in a legislative framework that would allow that to happen. Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> is yet another fulfillment of that election commitment. As I said, I believe Canadians would be very supportive of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379738">This is an important issue, if members think of carbon and what it does to our atmosphere. Reference has been made to two ways we can deal with it, such as carbon capture and storage. Incredible companies and individuals have looked at ways technology could advance the capture and storage of carbon. Another way is through nature, such as tree planting. I would encourage my colleagues across the way to stay tuned. They will hear more about tree planting going forward. I have had the opportunity to participate in tree planting ceremonies or activities in the last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379739">Net zero by 2050 is achievable. This legislation allows us to set that framework in which we will see regulations. It would create a very important advisory body, which would include individuals of stature, to look at achieving net-zero emissions. It would provide the current government, and hopefully future governments, the opportunity to ensure we stay on target.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379740">Yesterday, during the debate, I heard a Conservative member say that we had to ensure someone from the oil and gas industry would be on that board. The Conservative Party said that it was an absolute necessity; it was not an option. Then the NDP critic said absolutely not, that there should not be executive members from the industry on that board. That was the essence of what she said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379741">This is not new. Often we get extreme positions coming from the New Democrats and the Conservatives that are completely opposite. What they do not necessarily realize is that the best way to secure the economic development we desire collectively is to recognize the importance of the environment. If we work with stakeholders, we can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379742">I would encourage both members who spoke on behalf of their respective parties to read what the minister clearly indicated; and that is that we will have levels of expertise on that advisory group, which will include industry representation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379743">I asked a question of the previous Conservative member about a tweet yesterday. It was from the member for <Affiliation DbId="252818" Type="2">Edmonton Riverbend</Affiliation>. We introduced the legislation and the member planted a seed of doubt by asking if it was even achievable. I then listen to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252804" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>. From a Conservative perspective, no doubt it was a great speech. For those who want net-zero emissions by 2050, not so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379744">In fact, we should all be concerned about what the member said in his speech. He said that it was no problem. Heaven forbid the Conservatives form the next government. They could wipe out the legislation through their budget. The member has somewhat implied this, that they do not have to live up to the legislation the Liberals are putting into law today. After all, a future Conservative government could incorporate the wiping out of this legislation in a future Conservative budget bill. That raises a few red flags.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379745"> The Conservative Party needs to tell Canadians exactly what its intent is. Will the Conservatives stand by this legislation? Based on what I have heard, I am not convinced the official opposition is committed to net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379746">The Conservatives are already planning ways to get out of the legislation. The critic has said that the Conservatives have a number of changes they would like to make. We look forward to seeing those amendments once it gets to committee stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379747"> We have targets, the first one being in 2030. Within the next six months, we will see how achievable it is. Once we get to 2030, every five years after that it will be renewed. Therefore, there is a high sense of accountability. Those annual reports from the advisory body will also ensure there is more accountability and transparency. Unlike the Conservative Party, this government takes the issue seriously.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379766">Madam Speaker, I come to this esteemed chamber from Halifax, the heart of our great nation's maritime coast, Canada's ocean city and my hometown. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379767">We are a city shaped by the ocean. Our jagged coastline cuts into the Atlantic where surf-pounding shores are home to a proud people whose livelihoods for generations have relied on those deep blue waters. Along my riding's shoreline, there is cove after cove, including Ferguson's Cove, Herring Cove, Fairview Cove, Portuguese Cove, Duncan's Cove, Sandy Cove, and on and on, and the great Halifax Harbour and Bedford Basin. Each one is unique in its own way, but they are brought together by a shared identity as coastal communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379768">In my time as a member of Parliament, I have spent untold hours in these communities, knocking on doors or attending the many festivals and neighbourhood events, like the famous swordfish supper in Sambro. However, in recent years, with greater frequency, there is another reason I travel to these communities, and it is one that brings me no joy at all. In what has become a troubling routine, I find myself putting on my rain jacket and boots and heading out to these communities to survey the wreckage from the latest hurricane and the damage to my constituents' homes, fish shacks, wharves and boats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379769">In 2019, following Hurricane Dorian, I remember standing on a bridge in Herring Cove alongside constituents as we watched a detached roof float by us. The storm surge from that hurricane had compromised the breakwater protecting the cove and had lifted whole fish shacks from their resting places, smashing them against the rocky shoreline. We watched as one family climbed onto the splintered wood of their now unanchored fish shack, floating in the cove, to collect what few belongings remained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379770">Last week, I met with a group of constituents in Ketch Harbour to discuss the ongoing efforts to rebuild the community wharf that was destroyed in the same hurricane, more than a year ago. It was a devastating blow to a community that relied on that wharf as its town square. Earlier that summer, my daughter and I had enjoyed ice cream cones purchased from a makeshift ice cream stand on the wharf, with the proceeds funding the local community hall. However, the wharf is gone, at least for now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379771">I could tell story after story about how extreme weather events have impacted my city and constituents. I know my colleagues in the House understand this experience too, for many have taken on the same heartbreaking routine in their own communities, whether it is helping to mobilize volunteers to sandbag shorelines against 100-year floods now occurring nearly every year, or working to protect whole towns, forests and national parks from raging climate fires. The stories of devastation go on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379772">The science is clear: Climate change is escalating the severity and frequency of these severe weather events. For a coastal riding like mine, it is a flashing red alarm and all hands on deck. We are in a crisis, and we must act urgently to reduce emissions, fight climate change and protect our communities. At its core, that is the matter before the House today with Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379773">Hurricane Dorian hit Halifax just days before the 2019 election, and in that electoral race, our party, the Liberal Party, released its plan to continue our work to fight climate change. In our first mandate, we enacted the strongest climate plan of any government in Canadian history, as the moment required, with over 50 measures, including pricing carbon pollution, phasing out coal, protecting nature, investing in renewables and putting a climate lens on government-funded infrastructure, a measure quite personal for me. It was born out of a private member's motion I had passed in my first year as a member of Parliament, Motion No. 45.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379774">We turned the tide of inaction after 10 years under the Conservatives. Still, we recognized at the end of our first mandate that we needed to go further, and faster. Time, after all, is not on our side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379775">Today, as we debate Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> at second reading, we are carrying out one of the key promises we made to Canadians in 2019 when they looked at our record and plan and elected our Liberal government to do what is necessary to fight climate change again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379776">Included in our platform was a promise to exceed Canada's 2030 emissions goals, while setting legally binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act, is a key step in ensuring that we reach that target, fulfill our promise and get to net zero by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379777">I would like to speak about the measures within Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379778">The act would require that national targets and plans for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada be put in place with the target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. It would further require that the government make available, for the public to see and assess, its planning and progress toward those stated targets. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6379779">The act would require the government to establish its 2030 target within six months of the act's coming into effect, along with its emission reduction plan, and by 2027, the government would be required to publish its first progress report under the act. From there, in 2035, 2040 and 2045, the government would be required to set targets and provide its plan to get there by the subsequent five-year milestone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379780">The act would include a number of important accountability measures that impose consequences on any government that does not achieve its target. In such a scenario, the act requires that the Minister of Environment and Climate Change will provide an assessment report to Canadians that includes the reason why, in their view, Canada failed to meet its target and a description of the steps the government is taking or will take to address the failure to achieve the target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379781">In recognizing the important role of Parliament and officers of Parliament, the act would also require the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, supported by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada, to examine and report on the government's implementation of the measures it includes in its plan to reach its targets. Further, input from Canadians is essential to climate accountability, and to this end the act establishes an independent net-zero advisory body, a group of up to 15 experts from across the country in fields such as business, labour, indigenous knowledge and clean technology. It will include environmental leaders. This advisory body would provide advice in an annual public report, and an official government response would be required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379782">The purpose of the bill is to provide accountability and transparency to Canadians as their federal government, today and in the future, works to reduce emissions and fight climate change. It is what Canadians want and it is what we owe Canadians as we face one of the most urgent crises of our lifetimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379783">I would like to speak briefly now to the current state of climate politics in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379784">When I consider the massive challenge before us, I am troubled by the degree to which politicization of the issue of climate change has led to gridlock, inconsistency and inaction across governments as far back as the 1990s. This trend is not unique to the federal government or to Canada, but it is one that we must overcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379785">Action on climate should not be political. It should not be ideological. It should be based on science, based on evidence and based on all of us as parliamentarians looking out for the well-being of the people we represent in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379786">I think about the constituents I mentioned earlier, those I stood with on the bridge in Herring Cove following Hurricane Dorian. They did not care if I was a Liberal, Conservative, New Democrat or Green. They wanted to know what I was going to do as their representative in this place to help them, stop this crisis, fight climate change and protect our environment for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379787">I believe the legislation we are discussing today, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, will hold all governments accountable regardless of political stripe, accountable to Parliament and accountable to Canadians, today and in the future. I look forward to debate on the bill here and at committee, and I will remain hopeful that all members will come together in the interests of the people they represent to act and act now.</ParaText>

When I was in Edmonton, I met with energy workers who were frustrated because they are being sold down the river by the ideology of the Jason Kenney government. We see large international investors walking away from Alberta because of a lack of commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379802">The energy workers I met with are retraining themselves for a clean energy future. They asked me where the government is, both federal and provincial, with the huge opportunities there are to retool the economy in the west. Jason Kenney is not going to do it, we know that. The question is: Where is the federal government on the investments we need to start building solar and wind energy projects in the west?</ParaText>

They are innovating. They are rising to the challenge right in the very heart of Alberta. That is why we heard in the throne speech that this government will be undertaking the largest upscaling and rescaling of the Canadian workforce that we have ever seen, investing more in that effort than has ever been invested before.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379805">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="253140" Type="2">Regina—Lewvan</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379806">Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which we are discussing, purports to improve transparency and accountability as the government moves towards a net-zero target by the year 2050, which of course is 30 years down the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379807"> Before I get into the details of the bill, I just want to say that we, as Conservatives, acknowledge that Canadians love their environment and love their open spaces. As a father of four daughters, when I was a little younger, I spent a ton of time walking mountain ridges, hiking through valleys and on our lakes and rivers. We have done it all through beautiful British Columbia. We love our environment. I want to preserve that environment, not only for my daughters but for my grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379808">I believe Canadians are responsible. They want a responsible approach to protecting our environment while not sacrificing our long-term prosperity and the jobs that prosperity creates. As we move forward with a net-zero project, we want to make sure that it is our own environmental plan: a Canadian plan, driven by Canadian stakeholders and Canadian citizens, not by activist groups that in many cases are funded by foreign sources. We want this to be a homegrown solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379809">When I talk about solutions, this is a global problem that calls for a global solution. The Liberal government has always been focused inward. It asks what we are doing in Canada, not what can we do for the world. We have all kinds of opportunities to solve that global problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379810">Let me get back to the legislation itself and highlight three important elements within it. First, the legislation would require current and future federal governments to establish a framework to get Canada to net zero carbon emissions. Let us be clear, this framework is not an action plan and it certainly does not identify any additional tools that the government might use in reaching its 2050 target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379811">What does it mean to be net zero? I am going to try to briefly summarize what that is. It is a situation where the greenhouse gases that are caused by humans are balanced, or offset, by human intervention to remove the carbon from our environment. There are many different ways we could do that. Perhaps the most obvious is to plant a tree or trees, because trees sequester carbon dioxide and store that carbon within their trunks and branches. That is a simple situation that every Canadian would understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379812">However, Canada has many other areas where it is a world leader. Carbon sequestration can take place in things such as zero-till farming. Our farmers are leaders in this area of reducing tillage to make sure that we are not emitting more carbon than we absolutely have to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379813">We have some wonderful examples of carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS as it is called, in Canada, such as the Boundary Dam project in Saskatchewan, and Carbon Engineering in Squamish, British Columbia, close to where I live and where I often ski. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379814">These are opportunities for Canadian companies that have found a way of extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or from emissions, and reusing it. They are repurposing that carbon in other ways. For example, in Squamish, Carbon Engineering simply sucks the carbon dioxide out of the air. The company adds hydrogen and creates a new fuel. It is the cleanest fuel, and it can be used in something as simple as a car.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379815"> Clean fuels. Canadian innovation. That is something we do not hear a lot about from the Liberals. All they talk about is taxing. They make plans but those plans never materialize. The Liberals have had five years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6379816">Canada is also a leader in such things as hydrogen and nuclear technology. I am talking about 21st-century nuclear technology: modular nuclear technology that is safe to use. There is tremendous potential in that area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379817">The second thing this legislation does is call for the creation of an outside 15-member advisory board. Where have we heard that before? Let us remember the great electoral reform project that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> touted in 2015 during the election. The 2015 election was going to be the last time we were going to have elections under the first past the post system. He established a committee that was supposed to consult with Canadians, but the fix was in because he already had a preferred method that was going to favour Liberals. When the committee brought in the information that it had received from key stakeholders, he realized it was not going the way he thought it would, so he dropped the whole thing and fired his minister. That is what we get from the current Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379818">That is my fear. That is why I am skeptical about this legislation and especially this 15-member advisory board. Who is going to be on that board? Why will the Liberals not tell us? Will there be industry leaders on that board? Will the oil and gas industry be represented? Will they appoint members who are not married to the Liberal Party or insiders, such as Gerald Butts' friends, for example? Are they the ones who are going to populate this board? If so, this is going to turn into another disaster like electoral reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379819">The second question I have on that particular issue is, why did the government not table a framework and a plan back in 2015? The government has had five years to table a plan to move forward to provide Canadians with the tools they need so that we can reduce our emissions across Canada. There is a very easy answer to that question. It is because the government has failed to meet the targets that the Liberals themselves set at the Paris climate conference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379820">I was at that conference. I joined the Canadian delegation. I wanted to see what was going on there. The Liberal government had taken the Stephen Harper targets, which were going to be the floor, and the moment they got back from Paris the Liberals were going to ratchet up those targets. What happened is that we still have the same targets. There was no intention of making the targets stricter. Today we know from virtually every organization that is credible, including the IPCC, the Auditor General of Canada, the Climate Change Commissioner and even the government itself, that it is far from meeting the Paris targets that were set for 2030. What makes Canadians believe that the current Liberal government is going to meet its 2050 targets?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379821"> Why is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> making another promise that we know he will never be around to fulfill? That is the question Canadians should be asking themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379822">Conservatives in the House support this legislation. It is not because we trust the Liberals: we expect they are going to monkey around with this, as they normally do. However, this legislation is intended to increase transparency and accountability as Canada moves forward with its 2050 targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379823"> This is the problem with transparency and accountability. As my colleagues in the House will remember when the government was first elected in 2015, the government provided mandate letters for every minister, then and since, that say the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> expects them to raise the bar on openness, transparency and honesty. It is baked right into those mandate letters. I refresh myself by reading them from time to time. I want to make sure that the Prime Minister actually did that, because what we have today is the most unethical government our country has ever seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379824">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, on three occasions, has been charged with violating or is alleged to have violated the ethics laws of Canada. Twice, he has been convicted. There is a third case pending, and we expect he will be convicted on that one as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6379825">He is the first <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in Canadian history to whom this has happened. It is an ethical failure. How can we expect the Liberal government to fulfill its commitments to transparency and accountability in this legislation, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>? If Canadians are watching this today, they are going to start scratching their heads and asking themselves how many times the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has promised and not delivered. He has become the chief promise breaker of this country. It is a sad reflection on our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379826">Some have described this legislation as a “nothing burger”, as there is really nothing to it, just like <I>Seinfeld</I>, but I will conclude by saying this: We support this legislation—</ParaText>

The list goes on, and this will continue. Canadians should prepare themselves because under a Liberal government there will be more taxes placed on their shoulders. That is why we do not support the legislation. It is deeply flawed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379845">Mr. Speaker, I am going to start off with a quote from George Bernard Shaw: “We are made wise not by the recollection of our past but by the responsibility for our future.” I think that is a timely comment as we are talking about a bill that is not going to take effect until 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379846">I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the important issue of climate change and how we must rise to meet the challenge of the country. I want to take this important time to point out some things about Canadian energy producers and why our industry can be a part of the solution to climate change, not a contributor to the world problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379847">First off, we cannot talk about climate change without acknowledging that this is truly a global issue. The atmosphere cannot distinguish between two sides of a political border or even opposite sides of the planet. Environmental policy abroad impacts us here at home, and vice versa. When it comes to the planet, all of humanity is interconnected, whether we like it or not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379848">There is no question that Canada must do its part to fight climate change through increasing the use of renewable resources, employing Saskatchewan's innovative carbon capture and storage technology, expanding our use of nuclear power generation and using new technology to make our existing infrastructure greener and more efficient. I am confident that we can, should and will be leaders in the fight on climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379849">I will say once again that climate change occurs, and human activity influences this. However, our strategy must always keep the global nature of this problem in mind. Canada is not an island and cannot assume that rivals, or even allies, will follow our lead. We need to work with countries from around the world collaboratively to find ways that Canada can minimize environmental impact in the short term while investing in long-term solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379850">When we measure the total life-cycle emissions of liquefied natural gas and coal based on extraction, production, shipping and burning, liquefied natural gas burns roughly 40% cleaner than coal. If Canada were to expand its production capacity and increase LNG exports to developing countries currently using coal to bring electricity to underdeveloped regions, we would be taking a huge step forward, a concrete step in reducing emissions in the short term. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379851">China currently has a coal-fired electrical generating capacity four times larger than the United States' and plans to increase that number by over 25% in the coming years. If only a quarter of China's coal-fired plants transitioned to liquefied natural gas, it would result in emission reductions of around 750 megatonnes per year, based on current levels. For reference, Canada's total emissions in 2019 were 729 megatonnes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379852">The old saying “perfect is the enemy of the good” comes to mind here. While this government repeatedly fails to meet its emissions reduction targets, our energy industry, which is a world leader in environmental sustainability, continues to be crippled by regulations like Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> and the ineffective job-killing carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379853">Instead of leading a global strategy to reduce emissions based on research and development, technological innovation, and finding economically viable climate solutions, the Liberal government has reduced Canada's ability to compete and receive a market share with countries with zero track record when it comes to fighting global emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379854">Canada needs to strive toward energy independence, create a business environment that mobilizes green innovation in the private sector and export those green innovations around the world. Shutting down energy production in Canada would do nothing to impact the behaviour of countries whose entire economies relies on oil production. If anything, it would drive up global oil prices due to decreased supply and create even more incentive for oil production abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379855">Until we have long-term renewable energy solutions that are economically viable, natural resources such as oil and natural gas will continue to be a part of our way of life. It is not a matter of choice, but a matter of necessity. None of this is to say that it is acceptable to sit back and do nothing about this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379856">My colleagues on the other side of the aisle often scapegoat Conservatives as people who are indifferent about the environment or claim that we do not care about our children's future. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care, and we also want to work hard to bring our climate crisis under control.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379858">We need to reduce global emissions to avoid reaching the point of no return. I also know that Canada cannot sabotage our own industries as the rest of the world sits back. We cannot be the only country making drastic changes to our energy production capacity, and we cannot assume that we are setting an example for others. Currently, I cannot think of a single country that is looking to emulate Canada's emission reduction strategy and hamper its own ability to grow its economy.</ParaText>

We must invest in economically viable green energy solutions that we can export to the rest of the world. Canada has been behind countless green energy innovations. We have been an example to the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379860">One source of Canada's climate innovation is the careful management of our vast boreal forest spread across the country. Canada's network of forests is massive at over 347 million hectors, or 9% of the world's total forest area. Canadians continue to plant hundreds of millions of trees every year without the help of the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379861">Canada's forest industry alone plants an additional 600 million trees every year, making its commercial activities sustainable for generations to come. Canadian energy companies are doing their part as well. Syncrude has planted 11 million trees, Suncor has planted 8.9 million trees, and the faster forests initiative has planted over five million trees, just to name a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379862">Using forests as a natural climate solution is about keeping thriving forest ecosystems alive. Around 70% of carbon in the forest is stored within soil and debris on the forest floor. I know the government has set a target to plant two billion trees, but they have planted zero. Even on Father's Day, my wife asked me to plant five trees in our backyard, so I am doing more than our federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379863">Alongside capturing and storing carbon emissions, our forests are also home to another solution: biofuels. Canada exported 498.3 million dollars' worth of wood pellets in 2019, a solid renewable biofuel that grows back and recaptures the carbon that it emits when the biomass is burned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379864">I also want to talk about carbon capture and storage solutions. As a Saskatchewan MP, I am proud of the innovations we have made and are leading on this technological front. As an innovator and pioneer, Saskatchewan is proud of our carbon capture. Experts agree that carbon capture and storage is a solution that simply works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379865">Dr. Julio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, says that when industrial facilities implement variations of this solution, they see emission reductions of between 55% to 90%. About 300 million tonnes of CO2 is captured from large-scale carbon capture, utilization and storage facilities every year. The technology is effective and could lead to real world emission reductions in the short term if we embrace it. The downside is that currently 70% of this is done in North America when it should be done throughout the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379866">These are just a few examples of solutions that can drive economic activity, create jobs and act as long-term investments in emissions reductions. None of them involve new taxes, energy austerity or hurt our economy. In fact, all of the solutions I have raised would create new jobs and increase economic activity, instead of dampening it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379867">I believe in green innovation and I believe in clean technology, but I also know that shutting down Canadian oil and gas production would do nothing to change the course of history. The only way that Canada can have a meaningful impact on this issue is the same way we changed health care forever, through the development of revolutionary technologies like insulin and pacemakers. Both of these inventions saved millions of lives around the world and would have never been possible without Canadian ingenuity and perseverance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379868">We can meet these ambitious targets. I have unlimited faith in the sheer intelligence and capability of Canadians, but I also know that if we are not focused on solutions, we cannot be embraced by the rest of the world. It will be too little, too late, and our contributions will be in vain. We need the rest of the world to join us in our commitment to reducing emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379869">Net-zero emissions does not mean net-zero growth in the oil and gas industry, the agricultural industry and the manufacturing industry. We need to continue to rely on those very important sectors in our community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379893">Our plan is simple. We are supporting Canadian industry and investing in the cleanest solutions that generate the least amount of emissions possible and at the same time establishing a clear legal framework through Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> to set national targets and develop plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Canada in order to achieve net-zero emissions within 25 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379894"> Net-zero emissions is not just a plan for protecting the environment and managing climate change, it is also a plan for building a cleaner and more competitive economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379895">Bill C-12 proposes the <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act</Document>, which will force the current and future federal governments to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In doing so, we will be binding our government and all the ones that will follow. By imposing accountability, both politically and legally, we will earn the trust of Canadians and our industries in achieving net zero within 25 years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379897">At the core of this legislation is the requirement that the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of the Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> establish the initial 2030 target and an emissions reduction plan within six months of the act’s coming into force. I would be surprised if it takes that long. Both documents must be tabled in Parliament. A progress report must also be tabled by 2027. That is accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379898">The act requires the tabling and publication of targets, plans, progress reports and assessment reports. That is accountability. The legislation stipulates the content of milestone year plans, progress reports and assessment reports. That is more accountability.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379900">In addition to the strong parliamentary accountability mechanisms mentioned earlier, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, supported by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada, will have to examine and report on the Government of Canada’s implementation of the measures aimed at mitigating climate change within five years of the coming into force of this act and every five years thereafter.</ParaText>

We are also sending signals to industry and to the provinces about the seriousness with which we take this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379904">We will be sending a signal to the whole world that Canada will not fall victim to what Mark Carney has described as “the tragedy of the horizon”. Just because something is far off does not mean it will not hit us right between the eyes. It is already. My riding of Pontiac had massive floods in 2017 and in 2019. We are already paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379905">The bill contains the word “must”, 27 times by my count, in association with an action by a minister or some agent of government. Canadian environmental law is replete with discretionary provisions, meaning responsible ministers can quite often make decisions as they see fit and are not imposed an obligation at all times. The bill would impose 27 “the minister must”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379906">That is so important and should give Canadians a great deal of confidence. It means we will not just be generating political accountability through the bill, not only will we require the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> come before the House and account for the targets, the plans and the progress, but we will be enabling the public, if those duties are not fulfilled by those ministers, to bring the government to court.

              <ParaText id="6379907">It is not only in our environmental self-interest, it is in our economic self-interest. Our government has absolute commitment to achieving net zero by 2050.

              <ParaText id="6379918">He and I discussed Bill <Document DbId="10866095" Type="4">C-215</Document>, my bill on climate accountability. He told me that it was not the opposition's job to introduce bills like that but the government's. However, it seems his government completely missed the boat in the case of Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, because the government is not taking its responsibilities. The bill lacks accountability and transparency. His government promised to raise the 2030 target, which is not only the Paris Agreement target but also the target set by Stephen Harper's Conservative government. Let us not forget that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6379932">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, an act respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, as it is officially known. I like to call it the climate action accountability bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379933">I really am very happy, because this is the kind of legislation I have been waiting for ever since I was elected, just over five years ago. This bill does not go far enough as far as accountability is concerned, as I will mention later, but it is a good first step. We could strengthen that with amendments when it goes to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379934">This bill requires that the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> sets greenhouse gas emission targets at five-year intervals starting in 2030 and ending, of course, in 2050 with the goal of net zero. I will say right now that I think this is the bill's greatest flaw. Science tells us that the coming decade, from now until 2030, is the most critical time for action on climate change. Now is the time when we have to be bold. Now is the time when we have to make sure we are not just kicking this down the road any longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379935">Why is there not a goal for 2025? The Liberals have been in power for five years and have been talking the talk about climate action all that time, yet we have gotten nowhere on emissions reductions. In five years, the least they could have figured out is where we should be by 2025. That is the number one criticism of the bill. We need a 2025 target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379936">We also need a truly independent climate accountability officer whose only job is to monitor government action and effect. The environmental commissioner has other important topics that should be dealt with and is underfunded already on that front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379937">The advisory body this bill calls for should have a real specific role in setting targets, and the targets should not be set based on what the government feels is achievable without rocking any boats. They should be targets based on science and what we must do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379938">Another reason I am happy that this bill is finally coming forward is that Jack Layton tabled a similar bill in 2006. That is right, 14 years ago. That bill actually passed through the House of Commons, thanks to the fact that we were in a minority government at the time. People often think of minority government as not accomplishing anything, but the fact is that most of the good lasting actions by Canadian governments have come during minority Parliaments. That is another reason why we should embrace proportional representation in our electoral system, as they do in New Zealand and many other countries, but I digress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379939">Unfortunately Jack's bill was killed by the Conservatives in the Senate, an all too common example of anti-democratic action by that unelected body. I witnessed the same fate when my private member's bill was killed in the Senate last year, along with many others, as a handful of Conservative senators sought to stop Romeo Saganash's bill on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Happily, I hear there is a movement to change Senate rules so that private members' bills cannot be summarily stopped by a few unelected senators, but I digress once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379940">I ran for office five years ago because friends and colleagues told me they felt we needed more scientists in the House of Commons. It is indeed an honour and privilege to be here. When Canada went to the Paris talks in 2015, shortly after that election, I was proud of the commitments we made there. However, I was deeply disappointed the following spring when MPs were literally instructed by the Liberal government to go back to their ridings to find out what we should do to meet those Paris targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379941">We knew what we had to do. We had a long list of necessary actions to decarbonize our energy systems, electrify our transportation, retrofit our buildings to become energy efficient, and on and on. We knew we had precious little time to do it. Instead, we were told to spend six months or more talking to our constituents. I did that. I held town halls on climate change. The overwhelming message at those town halls was that we have to get on to it. People wanted to know why we were asking them, because we knew what we had to do and that we should just do our job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379942">I will not go into the litany of past commitments and broken promises by both Liberal and Conservative governments on climate action. It is clear that even the best intentions are stifled when the going gets tough. What the Liberal government did commit to at Paris was to use the old Harper climate target of bringing emissions down to 511 megatonnes by 2030. When it made that commitment, our emissions were at 720 megatonnes. By 2018, three years later, they had risen to 729 megatonnes. We are going in the wrong direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379943"> The Conservatives often give the excuse that Canada should not act on climate change, because we are a small country when it comes to population and there are much bigger contributors to global emissions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379944">The fact is we are the worst emitter on a per capita basis, and the rest of the world notices what Canada does or does not do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379945">A couple of years ago, I travelled to Argentina with the then Minister of Natural Resources for a G20 meeting on energy. The topic was energy transitions toward a cleaner, more flexible and transparent system. I was impressed by the presentations from countries such as Germany, Japan, the U.K. and China. They talked about bold action over the coming decade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379946">The U.K. minister, in particular, had a memorable way of summarizing his country's actions. First, was “walk the walk”, meaning legislate the targets and have accountability. At last we have something like that here. Second was, “put your money where your mouth is” and make significant investments now in clean energy transition. Finally was, “have your cake and eat it too”, meaning reap the benefits of the good jobs that are created by those investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379947">What did Canada say at that meeting? Our Minister of Natural Resources stood up and said that they probably heard we just bought a pipeline, and spent the rest of his time explaining why that was necessary, in some Orwellian way. One could almost hear the face-palms in the room. The only thing that kept us from being at the bottom of the heap in that G20 meeting was the fact that the Americans were there, talking about clean coal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379948">We found out this week, from the Canada Energy Regulator, of all places, that those pipelines, the Trans Mountain expansion, will not be necessary; nor will Keystone XL. It turns out that if we are serious about meeting our climate targets, which this legislation would signal we are, we will not need either of those projects to handle oil exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379949">There are many things in this bill that I like, beyond the fact that the government is admitting that politicians are bad at keeping promises without some external body looking over their shoulder and carrying some sort of stick. The Liberals are acknowledging in print that we must limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C, and that we are almost there so we have to work fast. The bill does reference the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the first step we must take in any transition to a clean energy future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379950">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> recently said of the lack of a 2025 target, “ultimately the accountability for government's actions or inactions is from Canadians themselves”. These are not the words of a climate leader. They are the words of a climate follower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379951">We will support this bill at second reading, but the Liberals must work with us to strengthen the accountability provisions by creating a 2025 target and a more independent commissioner dedicated to this job. Canadians expect nothing less than this, and not just Canadians. Let us remember that the world is watching and expecting Canada to do the right thing. My granddaughter in New Zealand will thank us.</ParaText>

The member was asked about LNG. The member says he does not support fracking. It is kind of rich for the NDP to say it does not want those who are actually putting forward the capital, who are actually doing what it takes. For example, Teck Frontier had the support of first nations and it was to be a net-zero project. LNG has the capacity to displace dirty coal sources and supply British Columbians with jobs. The member's community of Penticton has WestJet service from Calgary because of the investments of oil and gas workers and people who were investing in the wineries of the South Okanagan, which are very good.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379962">I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, an act respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. As I understand the legislation, there are generally five main objectives: one, require the government to produce three specific reports, namely an emissions reductions plan, a progress report and an assessment report with respect to future emissions goals, to be tabled in Parliament; two, provide for public participation; three, establish an advisory board to reach zero emissions; four, write a fourth report on financial implications through Finance Canada; and five, write a fifth report to be tabled every five years by the environment commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379963">I will say at the outset that I am generally in favour of more accountability and transparency and support the spirit of this legislation, but it does seem overly bureaucratic. In addition, it raises a number of red flags regarding the actions of the government as they relate to public accountability on environmental reporting and its progress to date. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379964">In 2016, I worked as a political aide for the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252933" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>. It was a new Parliament and there was general agreement that those on the environment committee wanted to work together for the well-being of Canada. This collaboration led to a June 2016 report entitled “Federal Sustainability for Future Generations—A Report Following an Assessment of the Federal Sustainable Development Act”. It received unanimous support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379965">The purpose of the report was to address the gaps in the Federal Sustainable Development Act outlined by former environment commissioner Julie Gelfand, who described the law as “a jigsaw puzzle without the benefit of the picture on the box.” The commissioner noted that the reporting required under the law gave readers a sense of progress, but “sufficient information was not included to provide a fair presentation of the progress being made”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379966">The committee wrote that the legislation did not meet expectations and there was general agreement by stakeholders that it lacked the enforcement necessary to improve how the government addressed environmental sustainability. The committee members recommended expanding the definition of “sustainability” in the act to include not just environmental considerations, but also thorough considerations of economic and social factors. Understanding sustainability more broadly would be instrumental in applying goals and targets that factored into all aspects of our government decision-making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379967">Some of the other considerations included enabling a whole-of-government approach to sustainability; assigning responsibilities to central agencies of the federal government; considering Canada's commitment to sustainable development internationally; considering short-, medium- and long-term targets; ensuring that the government respond to them; and setting additional measures for improving enforceability. The report was tabled in June 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379968">One year later, Bill <Document DbId="9057534" Type="3">C-57</Document>, an act to amend the Federal Sustainable Development Act, was tabled by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252947" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation>.

She thanked committee members and noted that this legislation would make Canada one of the greenest countries in the world, that sustainable development was at the forefront of the government's considerations, that it was about meeting the needs of future generations without compromising the present and that it would expand the definition of “sustainable development” to three core pillars: economic, social and environmental. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379969">All in all, Bill <Document DbId="9057534" Type="3">C-57</Document> and the original law, the Federal Sustainable Development Act, would mean a few things. The government would need to write a series of reports. There would be parliamentary oversight and regular reporting. It would set targets and strategies on sustainable development in line with these reports. There would be an expanded advisory board to improve public participation and hear from first nations. Sustainability would be a whole-of-government matter, and the environment commissioner would be required to review progress and report on whether the government was meeting its targets and doing what it said it would do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6379970">Upon review of the 2019 report entitled “Achieving a Sustainable Future”, as required under the Federal Sustainable Development Act, the government outlined 13 main goals: effective action on climate change, greening government, clean growth, modern and resilient infrastructure, clean energy, healthy coasts and oceans, pristine lakes and rivers, sustainably managed lands and forests, healthy wildlife populations, clean water, sustainable food, connecting with nature and safe communities. All in all, this is a pretty comprehensive set of goals and targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379971">We could argue that net-zero emissions cannot even be considered unless there is real and concrete action on at least 12 of the 13 existing targets in the federal sustainability report and, consequently, the act. I cannot think of many Canadians who would have a problem with the Government of Canada pursuing any of these objectives in a reasonable fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379972">However, here is the major problem. As of November 2, the Government of Canada has still not brought into force Bill <Document DbId="9057534" Type="3">C-57</Document>, which brings forward needed improvements to the government's approach on sustainability. The issues the environment committee sought to address in 2016 still exist. The environment commissioner outlined them in detail, noting the jigsaw puzzle without a picture on the box. The majority of environmentalists in our country also saw them as something wrong with the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379973">Nothing the member for <Affiliation DbId="252947" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> said on Bill <Document DbId="9057534" Type="3">C-57</Document> in 2017 about creating the greenest environment has even been operationalized, and given that the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has come before Parliament with a suite of new bureaucratic measures that would invariably duplicate existing objectives passed within Bill <Document DbId="9057534" Type="3">C-57</Document> and are contained within the Federal Sustainable Development Act and its report, I cannot but be skeptical about this approach. Why not try to address some of the tangible things we can do to improve our environment today toward a net-zero future, as outlined in the existing and stated goals, which are already subject to Governor in Council review, thorough parliamentary oversight and consideration by the Auditor General and by extension the environment commissioner?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379974">For example, Canada's regulatory framework under the Motor Vehicle Safety Act needs to be updated for new battery technology. What about the 13 goals, particularly clean growth and effective action on climate change? The Canadian Environmental Protection Act has not been substantially updated since its introduction by the Conservatives. We could do dozens of things there to improve product standards, help vulnerable populations and update our air quality monitoring systems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379975">Let us think about safe communities. We could plant a billion trees and reduce our environmental footprint. Let us think about conservation, clean water and healthy wildlife populations. We could work with like-minded countries to sign international agreements that would allow Canada to share our technological expertise. Let us think about effective action on climate change. We are still trying to operationalize those aspects of the Paris accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379976">We could continue so much work on protecting habitats and, subsequently, species at risk. We could work more closely with our first nations brothers and sisters to take meaningful action to protect wild salmon and conserve the remaining spawning habitats along the Fraser River. We could even develop an economic plan to incentivize investors in strategic areas like modern agricultural techniques, systems software and satellite technology to reduce our environmental footprint. We could help companies like Carbon Engineering scale its technology in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379977">What I see in the legislation before us is simply another example of Liberals talking a really good game yet doing next to nothing to make real progress right now. Is the government trying to make everyone laugh by requiring Finance Canada to write a report on risks and opportunities? It will not even commit to a 2021 budget. What a farce. The Parliamentary Budget Officer says the government lacks accountability and is not updating our public accounts and information on how the government is spending money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379978">What would have been more beneficial for our country and for the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> to consider doing would be something like the following. He should bring into force an updated Federal Sustainable Development Act, and include within it an updated strategy with five actions every year the government could take during its mandate to move toward a sustainable future so it would be subject to the review of the environment commissioner. We could give Canadians certainty about the actions being taken and the consequences of such actions in real time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6379979">We could set a standard for excellence today both in transparency and accountability, which are sorely lacking in the government and this legislation, and finally get to work and actually do something.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6379994">Mr. Speaker, we are here today to talk about Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, an act respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379995">I am happy to discuss the bill, because it is such an important matter for this country going forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379996">My first challenge with the bill is why the government needs to include words like “transparency” and “accountability” in a piece of legislation. These principles should be part of all government legislation and all government action. Unfortunately, that is the way this government sees things or demonstrates its actions. In fact, these actions are about anything but transparency or accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379997">It is important to go back to what the Paris Agreement is. The COP21, the conference of the parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held the carbon levels we were supposed to reach above pre-industrial levels to two degrees by the year 2050. We are doing our utmost to hit that. This requires, obviously, world action including Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379998">Planetary warming is going to happen around the world, and we need to contribute to making sure that we get everybody on the same page of reducing planetary warming. There are 7.5 billion people who live on the planet, and that would rise perceptually to 9 billion by 2050. All of these people emit carbon. All of these carbon-emitting entities depend upon carbon-based activities, including agriculture, livestock, heat and energy to fulfill their lives, which is the first tier of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6379999">I have been in the House for just over a year. I was elected in Calgary Centre partly to give voice to some reasonable voices in the energy industry in Canada and actually show how we could move forward on this file without submerging ourselves, as a country, and making sure we move forward with common sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380000">Interestingly, when we look at all the energy industries in Canada and the associations that represent them, they are all fully on board with getting to net zero by 2050. It is part of all of their advertisements and governance charters going forward. They are also the industry, people should remember, that pays the most taxes in Canada and that contributes the most to exports for a balance of payments, which is significant for this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380001">Also, whenever we buy fuel, we think about what fuel means in Canada, which is getting from place to place and getting our goods from place to place, including our food and clothes. That is where 45% of the cost of the input from petroleum products goes right back into the government's pocket: what we call “economic rent.” When we compare, dollar to dollar, which energy source is more efficient, which is costing more and which is contributing more, we need to level the field. We need to understand that if we did away with oil and gas, which is what I am hearing some of the members in the House say, we would effectively be doing away with not only a very important industry to Canada, but a very important tax base to Canada. We would then have to replace that with taxation from Canadians generally, and the government would find another way to tax Canadians. However, let us look at that contribution and make sure that it is considered in this discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380002">The Liberal government continues to fail on the environment file. The Liberals have yet to come up with a plan that works, because they do not really understand energy, and I do not mean just fossil fuel energy. I mean all energy: the contributions to energy, how energy is produced and what the effects of producing energy are. There is always an effect to producing energy, even if it is in storage, whether it is hydro or uranium. There is an effect, no matter the sort of energy we get our power from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380003">We talked about listening to the science, yet in my short time here, I am challenged to find a member on the government bench who actually understands science. Please guide me.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380004">At the same time, the government ignores the multitude of scientists who have provided significant input on this file. I recall the task force for resilient recovery. In the midst of a pandemic, Gerry Butts and his rent-seeking friends jammed an agenda forward. Canada was suffering a pandemic. Is this transparency? Is this accountability? Do not let a good crisis go to waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380005">Gerry Butts had a lot of success. He camouflaged a $107-billion speculative program, at least, into a $49.9-billion talking point that was largely reflected in the throne speech. This is not a talking point. This is Canada's environment. This is Canada's future we are talking about. The task force said “it is time to go big”, which means playing roulette and betting Canada's future on red 36. Canadians deserve better stewards of their future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380006">In reading the task force report and then reading the government's throne speech, one notices that the paraphrasing in the throne speech is astounding. These reports had the same author. Who paid them? Who will pay them? Will it be the 15 advisers in this legislation? Not one of the task force members was a scientist, which is interesting. The report is littered with the moralistic right-speak of public policy experts: people who are interested in their own agenda, which is often their own financial agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380007">Perhaps we should look at the 15-member advisory board that is proposed in this legislation. A potential path forward that the government should consider, in my opinion, is for 15 advisers to be appointed to the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. Perhaps the government could commit to appointing 15 people who actually represent the 15 sectors that contribute to Canada's economy. There are enough public policy experts in the bowels of every government department. We do not have to hire others and get their input on what they should already have from their officials. We do not need more public policy experts. Bring in the economy's real experts: those who are contributing to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380008">While we are talking about transparency, it is timely to discuss the regulation currently being constructed by Environment and Climate Change Canada: its so-called Clean Fuel Standard. In effect, it is a hidden carbon tax on Canada's productive industries. It is inequitably applied. The industry is waiting, once again, to see how the government may exempt them. A little influence in the government never hurt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380009">It is about picking winners and losers. It is not about transparency and definitely not about accountability. It is not about Canada's environment. It reminds me of the manufacturer's sale tax from years ago that had to be cancelled in the 1980s because industries left Canada. Industries still produced goods for Canadians elsewhere, but jobs and taxes left Canada. Everything left Canada, and it is what we now call carbon leakage because there was the same production and Canadians still bought the same goods that were produced elsewhere. This is an example we do not want to repeat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380010">There is a lot that has to happen in the energy industry. There is a lot that we need to make sure gets better, and we need to continue to reduce carbon. I am hopeful this bill gets us part of the way there. I am hopeful the government will start taking this file seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380011">To this point, all I have heard is partisan shouting out of that side and blaming past governments for what they did not do. It is the Liberals' turn to step forward and move this file forward. We are trying to work with them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380021">Mr. Speaker, the world's top scientists are telling us that we must dramatically reduce our emissions by 2030 if we want to avoid the worst consequences of severe climate change. The IPCC has been very clear that we need to stabilize global temperature to 1.5°C if we want to avoid the catastrophic issue that is facing us. We need to go beyond Stephen Harper's targets. Right now, the government has a milestone target of 2030. That means the next progress report will not be until 2028.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380022">I am hoping my colleague agrees with me, that we need to listen to science and we need to set a much stronger target than 2030. </ParaText>

Let us recognize that each one of these targets is politically set: 1.5°C is a political number, 2°C is a political number and 2030 is a nice, round political number. Is it going to be worse from now until 2025 than it will be from 2025 until 2030? All of these are dancing on the head of a pin, as far as what is worse and what the measures are.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380025">Mr. Speaker, to my hon. friend from Calgary Centre, I think it is terribly important to disagree as forcefully as possible with the notion that 1.5°C is a political target, as 1.5°C has emerged from the intense work of thousands of scientists globally in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was commissioned by governments to find out exactly what the difference is, in terms of impacts, between a 1.5°C global average temperature increase and a 2°C increase. Both of those figures are embedded in the Paris Agreement. They are critical to ensure human civilization survives. That is not hyperbole. That is science. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252591" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> had it just right. If we do not achieve 45% reductions globally by 2030, we cannot have a prayer of reaching net zero. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380027">Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the member misunderstood my statement. The number arrived at is 1.5°C, but if we get to 1.49°C, I am saying that is actually better. This is not a line in the sand. That is my point to the member. I hope she takes it in the spirit it was intended. The number 2°C was decided on in the 1992 accord as what we needed to get to, and we needed to make sure in 2015 that we had methods for getting there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380028">In all good spirits, I am certain the member did not mean to misinterpret my remarks to say it was political or non-scientific. They are numbers that people can attach themselves to. If we get to 2.01°C versus 2°C, or we go to 1.98°C or to 1.49°C versus 1.5°C, I think we are still talking about those numbers.

              <ParaText id="6380030">Before I get into my remarks today, I would like to notify you that I would like to share my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252591" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation>, who will make a speech after me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380031">As I said, it is my pleasure to participate in this important debate. It is a topic that is extremely important. It has been important to me throughout my entire life. It is something my constituents care about and remind me of all of the time and this legislation as proposed provides an accountability framework. It certainly does not provide the content of a plan for moving forward. It really defines a framework for accountability and that is a positive step forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380032">Canada and countries around the world are facing unprecedented economic, environmental and social challenges, which are all occurring at the same time. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant loss and uncertainty in Canada. Almost half of households lost work at the peak of the pandemic, impacting the ability of families to pay rent and put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380033">Responding to the pandemic and ensuring that Canadians can move forward into a recovery phase that ensures there are good jobs and a solid plan for a strong, resilient, competitive and sustainable economy matters more than ever. We need a road map for the future, one that takes into account our current reality but also where we want the world to be in 10, 20 and 30 years from now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380034">What we know is that the world is changing. Countries are responding to the fallout from the pandemic, but many are doing so in a way that takes into account the equally urgent crisis of climate change. In some respects, the current public health crisis pales in comparison to the larger and impending crisis that will see the effects of human activity, which has harmed our natural world for generations, leading to the alteration of weather patterns, mass extinctions, the loss of biodiversity and even the collapse of ecosystems, which ultimately threatens the habitability of our planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380035">The science is very clear that we face a catastrophic future if we do not dramatically alter the amount of pollution we are putting into the atmosphere. I learned recently of a remarkable independent film called <I>The Magnitude of all Things</I>, and that film masterfully depicts a phenomena called climate grief, which is the loss we are all feeling from the destruction of our home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380036">The science is clear that we need to bend the curve on GHG emissions now and achieve net-zero emissions globally by 2050. Countries around the world are responding to this imperative and they are also moving to take advantage of the clean growth opportunities that will come with it. Those are significant and Canada has enormous advantages, ranging from our vast natural resources to our skilled population, our commitment to research, our innovation and our entrepreneurial spirit. We need to seize the opportunity now. We need to do our part to demonstrate our commitment to the rest of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380037">From forest fires and floods to melting permafrost and coastal erosion, Canadians are experiencing the impacts of climate change every single day. Our climate is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. In the north, warming is nearly three times as fast. The effects of warming are already evident in many parts of Canada and are projected to intensify in the near future. We can see this with wilder weather and seasons and lots of flooding. There is much evidence of these weather patterns changing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380038">In December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Canada played a leadership role in reaching a historic agreement to address climate change. Canada was also one of the first countries to ratify the Paris Agreement and help push it over the threshold to bring it into force in October 2016. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380039">Through the Paris Agreement, we committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increase to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement, Canada developed the first climate change plan in our history to include joint and individual commitments by federal-provincial-territorial governments and to have been developed with input from indigenous peoples, businesses, non-governmental organizations and Canadians from across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380040">The pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change was adopted in December of 2016, and this was a huge step forward. In fact, one of the reasons I got into politics in the last federal election was that great work. The pan-Canadian framework outlines over 15 concrete measures to reduce carbon pollution, help us adapt and become more resilient to the impacts of a changing climate, spur clean-technology solutions and create good jobs that contribute to a stronger economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380041">Between 2005 and 2019 the federal government invested $60 billion to drive down greenhouse gas emissions, generate clean technologies, help Canadians and communities to adapt to the changing climate, and protect the environment. Carbon pollution pricing systems are in place in all provinces and territories, and we have introduced regulations to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector and to improve emissions standards for light- and heavy-duty vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380042">As we work to phase out coal-fired electricity by 2030, we have worked with communities and workers affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are developing net-zero energy-ready building codes to be adopted by 2030 for new buildings, and we have adopted a climate lens to ensure that future climate impacts are considered and addressed in federally funded infrastructure projects. To ensure Canadians have access to climate science and information, we established the Canadian Centre for Climate Services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380043">Our plan is working. Our most recent projections show a widespread decline in projected emissions across the economy. The policies and measures now in place, including those introduced in 2019, are projected to reduce emissions by 227 million tonnes by 2030. However, we know that a great deal of work remains to be done. The 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change also invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to prepare a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. I have that report here, and I have been reviewing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380044">In 2018, the special report on “Global Warming of 1.5°C” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that global emissions must reach carbon neutrality by around 2050 to limit warming to 1.5°C. There are clear benefits to limiting global temperature increases to that level. The IPCC's report made it clear that, to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, an aggressive and long-term commitment to action is needed. Every bit of warming matters, and this is why it is urgent to take action now. Increasing ambition is what science tells us is needed to address climate change, and it is built into the Paris Agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380045">We are currently working on strengthening existing and introducing new greenhouse gas emission reduction measures, which will allow us to exceed our current 2030 target. On top of that, we know that we need to look to the longer term, which is why we committed to enshrining, in legislation, the government's goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Along with this system of five-year targets, emissions reduction plans, progress reports and assessment reports are key enabling components of our work to achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380046">Our government has committed to implement a number of new measures to help us reach these ambitious targets, while creating a million new jobs and growing the economy. This includes a commitment to plant two billion trees to help sequester carbon, retrofitting 1.5 million homes to improve energy efficiency and save Canadians money on their energy bills, making it easier for Canadians to purchase and drive zero-emission vehicles, and supporting northern, remote and indigenous communities as they transition from diesel to renewable energy systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380047">These measures and more, which the government plans to announce soon, will help put Canada on a path to a strong zero-emissions economy, one that is inclusive for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380048">I am going to stop there. I had a few more remarks, but I understand that my time is limited. I will stop there, but I am thankful for this opportunity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380074">The bill before us, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act, is about accountability but also about ambition. I want to start with what is very good in the legislation on ambition, which is the commitment to net zero by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380075">In the last Parliament, I was lucky to join two other colleagues from the Green Party and the NDP to call for a climate emergency debate in the wake of the IPCC report on 1.5°C. I introduced a bill on net zero by 2050 in the House. I was very happy to see that in our platform and the throne speech. Now it is realized as a commitment in this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380076">In the purpose clause, the legislation says the purpose is “to promote transparency and accountability...in support of achieving net-zero emissions in Canada by 2050”. Importantly, in the preamble, the IPCC is explicitly cited. The IPCC concluded, “achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is key to keeping the rise in the global-mean temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and minimizing climate-change related risks.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380077">Of course, 2050 is a long time away, so we need to turn that long-term ambition into short-term practical action and we do so in the course of the legislation by way of five-year milestone targets. That is important. We talked about carbon budgets in our platform. It is important for everyone in the House to support the bill going to committee. When it gets to committee, I am certainly interested in hearing from experts about the difference between the carbon budget process and the milestone process that our government has proposed. It is very important that we not just talk about net zero by 2050, but look at shorter-term milestones and targets as well. That is an important ambition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380078">When it comes to accountability, it is important to highlight a series of positive measures in the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380079"> We first see progress reporting, a requirement of one progress report per milestone at least two years before the milestone. We see a requirement to table assessment reports and an important requirement for the government to table an emissions reduction plan in Parliament to tell the public how we will meet these shorter-term targets and get to net zero by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380080">We also see a requirement for an expert advisory body that is to not only advise the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> but report annually to the minister and the minister must respond in a public fashion. These are important accountability mechanisms. We see a requirement for annual reports from the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> on how the government is taking key measures to manage financial climate risks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380081"> Last, we see a requirement for an independent environmental commissioner tasked with examining and reporting on our progress and holding us to account if we fail to meet the necessary progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380082">I started with the positives, but let me speak to some of the challenges. Before I get to the challenges, when I speak of accountability ambition and action, this is not an action plan. For anyone looking at this plan, saying we are speaking about the importance of climate change and asking where the action is, this is not the action plan. We have seen significant action over the last five years, and I can get into the details of that. We have seen projected 2030 emissions between 2016 and 2019 go down 25% because of the policies we put in place, but this is fundamentally about accountability and brings with it a commitment to greater ambition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380083">It also kicks the can down the road too far. I mentioned turning that longer-term ambition into short-term action. While this is a very strong framework for accountability, there is a significant “but”. That is because this act, as structured, provides the first milestone target as 2030. What this means is that the first progress report would not be required until no later than December 31, 2027.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380084">Clearly, we need a more urgent and credible reporting timeline to meet the act's goal of transparency and accountability. There are a few ways of answering this challenge, in my view. A number of environmental organizations and colleagues have proposed that we move up the first milestone from 2030 to 2025. This would mean that an initial progress report would be required by the end of 2022, and there is some sense in this. Very smart environmental advocates have called for this solution to address the challenge that I have described.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380085">There is another way of addressing this challenge, though. When we look at science-based ambition, we have a 2050 target in this bill, a net-zero, science-based target from the IPCC, and we could have a science-based 2030 target in this bill as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380086">What does a science-based 2030 target mean? We talk about net zero by 2050, but the IPCC also tells us that, on that pathway to one and a half degrees, the world needs to be 45% below 2010 levels by 2030. What does that mean in a Canadian context? In 2010, our emissions were 691 megatonnes, and 45% below that is 380. That should be our minimum target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380087">If we look to the Paris Agreement and the fact we are a highly developed country, we might argue credibly that we actually ought to go further. At a minimum, on the science, the target for 2030 should be 380 megatonnes. If we establish that target in a science-based and serious way, then in the course of this act, we could provide for earlier progress reports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380088">I would certainly be comfortable with a strong science-based 2030 target. If we do not have a 2025 target, but a strong science-based 2030 target, I would certainly be comfortable with earlier progress reports in 2030, 2025, 2027. With those, this would be a very strong bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380089">I have heard from other advocates that we could strengthen the advisory body's role in setting targets and in progress reporting. We could better ensure its independence. I have seen suggestions to require the minister to consider expert advice when setting targets. There are reasonable questions about capacity issues in the environmental commissioner's office to do this serious work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380090">This is the framework we are looking to. In the U.K., as an example, the climate change committee that was established through legislation in 2008 has great resources. We need to ensure any independent body standing up to do the accountability job has the necessary resources to do that job effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380091">As I mentioned previously, the difference between milestone targets and carbon budgets has also been raised with me. All these considerations will rightly be addressed by experts at committee, and I sincerely hope we see proposals from all parties and constructive work at the environment committee to improve this bill. It is a strong framework but it absolutely does need to be improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380092">To close, I just want to emphasize that accountability and ambition are important, but at all times we must be guided by science. Our ambition must be set by science and this accountability act should be as robust as possible. Then of course everything depends upon serious climate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380093">I know there are questions about impacts on the economy. This bill, in the preamble, recognizes the importance for the economy to move toward a clean transition, but this is really about jobs as much as it is about climate action for our kids. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380094">We have made significant progress since 2015, so let us, united across party lines, build on that progress. Let us bring, as I say, the same determination and scale of response to the climate crisis that we have brought to the COVID crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380096">One of the frustrations for me in our debates about climate change is that we spend relatively so much more time talking about targets than about the action that will allow us to move toward those targets. We had a big discussion about which targets are appropriate for what year, but we also have to make decisions based on immediate actions and trade-offs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380110">Mr. Speaker, this is a frustrating question in some respects in that it suggests there has been no action.

If we fast-forward to early 2019, that same report is showing it at 592 megatonnes.

In our throne speech we promised to immediately and urgently eliminate chronic homelessness in Canada. We have started on that promise with a $1-billion investment in the creation of rapid housing, while continuing to protect the homeless further made vulnerable by COVID. Since the pandemic began, we have invested $157 million in the reaching home program, $200 million for food banks and $100 million for women's shelters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380396">I am ready to rule on a point of order raised on November 3, 2020, by the hon. <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> to the government House leader concerning Bill <Document DbId="10866085" Type="4">C-214, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (qualifying environmental trust)</Document>, standing in the name of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252887" Type="2">Calgary Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380397">In his intervention, the parliamentary secretary alleged that the bill should have been preceded by a ways and means motion. He argued that the bill would expand the definition of “qualifying environmental trust” to include a trust maintained for the sole purpose of funding the reclamation of an oil and gas well. As such trusts are taxed, he argued that the bill would extend the tax to a new class of taxpayer and should therefore be ruled out of order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380398">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252887" Type="2">Calgary Centre</Affiliation> argued that his bill would not create a new class of taxpayer, but would merely allow the oil and gas industry to use an existing tax mechanism already in use by the extractive industries. He also argued that an increase in tax revenue would only be incidental and would therefore not normally require a ways and means motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380399">Bill <Document DbId="10866085" Type="4">C-214</Document> would amend the Income Tax Act to include, in the definition of “qualifying environmental trust”, trusts that are maintained for the sole purpose of funding the reclamation of an oil or gas well operated for the purpose of producing petroleum or natural gas. As the sponsor of the bill noted, such trusts may already be used to fund reclamation activities by other extractive industries, but the act currently prohibits the use in relation to oil and gas wells. The bill's sponsor has argued that such a prohibition is unfair and that his bill seeks to correct the inequity. The Chair's decision, however, must be based not on the worthiness of the bill's policy objective, on which the Chair has no views, but rather on its compliance with our rules.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380402">The question before the Chair is whether Bill <Document DbId="10866085" Type="4">C-214</Document> extends a tax to a new class of taxpayers. The tax treatment of qualifying environmental trusts, or QETs, is admittedly quite complex, with a series of offsetting credits and deductions between the trust and the corporation that contributes to it. Generally, such a trust is created by a corporation as it would provide a tax advantage.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6380403">However, this is not a circumstance where the bill proposes a tax reduction or a tax credit. The means by which this advantage is gained is through the creation of a separate and distinct taxpayer, the trust. The bill's sponsor argues that QETs already exist as a class of taxpayers. Indeed they do. At present, however, the Income Tax Act specifically excludes a trust relating to the reclamation of a well. This exclusion has been part of the act ever since these sorts of trusts were first introduced in Bill C-59, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Application Rules, in 1995, when they were originally known as mining reclamation trusts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380404">Having been renamed “qualifying environmental trusts” in 1998, the number of eligible industries was expanded to include other extractive industries in 2011 via Bill <Document DbId="5145722" Type="3">C-13, An Act to implement certain provisions of the 2011 budget as updated on June 6, 2011 and other measures</Document>. Each of these bills was preceded by a ways and means motion. While they clearly contained other measures, the Chair believes that such a motion was necessary to expand the various types of industries able to create a QET.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380405">Accordingly, a ways and means motion is necessary. The bill cannot proceed and should be discharged. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6380409">Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my colleagues from all sides of the House for giving me this opportunity to speak today. While I do plan to stick around a little while longer, the uncertainties that we are facing as a nation and, indeed, within the House mean that this could be the last chance I have to physically stand in the House to say farewell.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380410"> I must also warn members that I plan to be uncharacteristically non-partisan in my remarks today because, quite frankly, it is not about the politics here; it is about the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380411"> Whenever I am asked what it is like to be an MP, I always reply one thing: It is the most challenging, demanding, frustrating, worthwhile thing that I have ever done. There have been a lot of times over the last 16 years where there were ups and downs. I have lost a lot. I lost my husband, my father, my vision temporarily, my appendix and my dear neurotic cat. However, I also gained more than I ever could have imagined: amazing experiences across Canada that only deepened my love for this great country, friendships that will last a lifetime, an undying respect for this institution and for those who serve in it, and a pair of titanium hips. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380412">For some, becoming an MP is not something they always plan to do. Sometimes, it is the issues of the day that really push someone to serve. While the issues and events in 2004 were definitely the tipping point for me, my desire to help those in my community started many years earlier. When I was about nine years old, my mother sat me down on the eve of an election to tell me what democracy was, how important it is and how very lucky we are to have it. I remember that conversation vividly, and I can say that, from then on, I dreamed of having the opportunity to fight for the people at home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380413">Therefore, to everyone in Haldimand—Norfolk, I cannot thank them enough for making the dreams of that little nine-year-old girl come true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380414">I have to say it has been a heck of a ride since 2004. From being named agriculture critic during the BSE crisis, serving in former prime minister Stephen Harper's cabinet for all 10 years, to being named the Conservative caucus party liaison and a member of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, every position has come with its own challenges and memories that I treasure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380415">Some of those include creating the universal child care benefit, promoting and delivering the tobacco transition support program, imposing measures to protect potential human-trafficking victims here in Canada, stickhandling numerous infrastructure projects for Haldimand and Norfolk counties through the bureaucracy, breaking down barriers faced by persons with disabilities, and finally, retiring and replacing the aging Sea King helicopter fleet with the new Cyclones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380416">Through it all, I have truly been blessed to have amazing people by my side, people who have challenged me to do my best, who have stuck with me through the high times and the low, and who even laugh at my sometimes warped sense of humour, and on a daily basis. While I may have been labelled the toughest bird in cabinet at one point, I am a firm believer that if a person cannot laugh at themselves, they are just not funny enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380417">From the very beginning, my parents were my biggest champions. During many elections, my dad would knock on doors with me, and my mom was always working in the campaign office. Thankfully, I still have my mother today. I know Mom will be watching this; I thank her and I love her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380418">Of course, I also could not have done any of this without my late husband, Senator Doug Finley. </ParaText>

He was also one of my biggest supporters, both professionally and personally. As far as we can tell, we were the first married couple to sit in both Houses of the Canadian Parliament at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380420">I would like to thank those in my life who have made it possible for me to still be here today.

              <ParaText id="6380427">To my Conservative family, it has been an absolute pleasure getting to know all of them and working hard with them to help Canadians. It is the values that have kept me blue through and through, the values of hard work, showing respect for other people, looking after one's family, smaller government and lower taxes. That is why I am so excited for the future of the Conservative Party under our new leader and for what my colleagues will continue to do for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380428">Most importantly, to the residents of Haldimand—Norfolk, I thank them from the bottom of my heart. I know I am not at all biased when I say that Haldimand—Norfolk truly is the best place to grow up and live. As part of Ontario’s south coast, yes, Canada’s fourth coast, we have some of the most hard-working, friendly, salt of the earth people, people who know what it means to pull up their socks to get a job done or to help a neighbour. It has been an absolute privilege to be the MP for these amazing people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380429">It is time for me to turn a new page. It is time to hit the refresh button. It will soon be time for me to indulge my creative side; to travel, hopefully; to take some courses; and to finally get to my “want to do” list. I am looking forward to this new chapter of my life and what it will bring. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380430">To all those young people out there who have a dream like I had, I urge them to go after it, chase it, pursue it, live it. It might not be easy, but I assure them it is worth it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380433">What an honour it is for me, on behalf of my colleagues and on behalf of the Conservative caucus, present and past, to thank the hon. member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="252564" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation> for her tremendous public service and her touching remarks today, which cap her incredible service not just to Haldimand—Norfolk, but to all of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380434">What an honour it is for me to be a colleague of and to pay tribute to someone I have admired for a great time. As a party activist, as many of us volunteer and take part in politics, I watched her incredible work helping merge the parties. The hon. member was, by half an hour only, I have learned, the second candidate nominated for the newly created modern Conservative Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380435">With her background, not only professionally, with an MBA from Western, but also being bilingual and running a French immersion program for a time and working in the private sector, it was known that, with the hard work of merging the parties and preparing the government in waiting at the time, she would be an important, literally a critical part, of a Conservative government. This was after more than 15 years of Conservatives being in the wilderness, politically, in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380436">What an incredible record this hon. member had as minister of citizenship and immigration, minister of human resources and skills development, and minister of public works and government services. I am glad she mentioned, after a generation, she gave the RCAF a new Maritime helicopter. I love her even more because of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380437">I was a young cadet when that program was cancelled. It had languished and hung out there, and then a strong minister, who always had the service of our men and women and their best interests at heart, finally got that major procurement done and bought the Cyclone. I have been able to fly it. It is a testament to her service to our country and our interests around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380438">She is the last of the titans, the last member of Parliament in our caucus who has served as a member of the government and a member of cabinet at senior levels for every single year in the period of the Harper government. That corporate memory, that knowledge is something I do not want to lose, and I am in awe of her tremendous contribution to our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380439">Her presence on our team is thoughtful, connecting our caucus to our grassroots, and always making people feel welcome. The Christmas lights in her Parliament Hill office often showed how welcoming she is to new people, and her mentoring of many of young members, especially some of our women joining a political career, who are able to look up to someone who had had tremendous success and learn from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380440">Then, of course, there is the great love story of the upper and lower houses of Parliament in Canada, which includes a meeting at Rolls-Royce in the private sector. I love that part of it, too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380441">Doug was in the private sector at Rolls-Royce. They met, and obviously shared a love for Parliament. Then, I, too, think they are the only, or at least the first, husband and wife to serve at the same time in the upper and lower chambers of this great Parliament, and at senior levels, I might add, throughout that period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380442">That is a legacy. We lost our friend, Senator Doug Finley, but they created a legacy together in the scholarship fund for young people. Once a year, even virtually, the event brings people together to celebrate public service, which we saw today can often be fractious. We need to celebrate and instill that in young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380443">The good people of Haldimand—Norfolk have been well served. Her advocacy, to the point of bragging about that region of Ontario being the bread basket and the greenhouse of our province and our country, is something that all MPs should strive to do as champions for their community. When she informed me of her news, she said, right up to the last day, she is going to be working with people in her riding on grassroots petitions and on issues until her last moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380444">That exemplifies the type of service the member has given. When we look at the book of wisdom that she is handing on to the next generation, many of them here in the chamber with us, that is a legacy of service that will last for many years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380445">I am very happy that she has already provided much of that wisdom, introduction and mentoring to Leslyn Lewis, who we hope will join our team from Haldimand—Norfolk, showing that the continuity of public service, of Conservative ideals and principles, will be the hallmark of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252564" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation>'s career, from the first moment she was elected through to the last day she will spend as an MP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380446">I will end on this note: As the last of the titans, as someone who was in cabinet and had to defend a Conservative government, often in front of a somewhat hostile press gallery, the member's family motto was “brave in difficulties”. At least that is one of the member's mottos, and she wore it with pride and vigour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380447">She was not only brave, she was noble and resolute throughout challenging times, the great recession and the transformation of government. It is a legacy I think all Canadians of all political stripes can be thankful for. I ask all colleagues to show tribute to the member today for her public service.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6380448">Madam Speaker, it is a tremendous privilege to rise today in the House and speak on behalf of the Liberal caucus and this side of the House. If I may begin by saying that, for the last 16 years, this House has been more thoughtful, richer, more compassionate and more competent because of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252564" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation>'s presence here. It has also been a bit more feisty and fun.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380449">I want to really express the gratitude we have on this side of the House for her collegiality and sense of engagement. Whether she was on this side of the House or that side of the House, one knew they could depend on that member to be fair, to be thorough and to always stand up for what is best in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380450">Six elections are no small feat. If we call a 20% or 25% margin a squeaker, she has had some pretty rough rides. It has been fascinating to watch both her parliamentary career, as well as her government career, and we are richer in Canada because of her time in those people departments, especially. Of course, Public Works and Government Services was important, but the member shone as a minister for people, whether it was at Human Resources and Skills Development, or Citizenship and Immigration. It was in these kinds of places where people's lives changed because of her care and compassion. It was noted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380451">Sometimes I hated being on that side of the House watching her on this side of the House exercising that care with such grace, competence and love. That really has been an important part of what we need to do in this place and to remember her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380452">The actions she has made have really made the people of Haldimand—Norfolk know that they were well represented in this place. It is all about bigness in that riding, from the Grand River on one side to Big Creek on the other side and to Long Point on the fourth coast. In Simcoe, Delhi or Port Dover, the people knew they were well represented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380453">Just this last February the member, whom I want to call by name but I am not going to, for <Affiliation DbId="252564" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation> called about two of her constituents from Port Dover. They were on the Diamond Princess and needed help getting home. She knew all the details, and showed all the care. It was such a moment of good constituency care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380454">As a minister, as a member, as a human being and as a sister in this place, we can only wish her the very best of luck and best wishes as she undertakes this next chapter of her life. I am interested to know what she is going to do with it. I have already told her privately a number of goals I thought she should have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380455">To the little Girl Guide in Port Dover, who became, through an MBA, a successful business person, and on to be a passionate parliamentarian, competent minister and gracious human being, Godspeed, best wishes and much love.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380456">Madam Speaker, I am also pleased to recognize the work and accomplishments of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252564" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380457">She has been a member of the House since June 2004. Today, I understand her decision to leave us. She has served the public, served others, for over 16 years. She can be proud of what she has accomplished. If I were her, I would be proud too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380458">I met my colleague in 2006, when I was the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry and she was a minister. As members have said, she has held a number of cabinet positions. What stands out about her to me is her kindness. She was the kind of minister who was not intimidating at all, so opposition members were not too shy to cross the floor of the House to talk to her about specific files. She was always friendly and attentive to all members who had things they wanted to ask her about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380459">Today, she gave her speech mostly in English, but I know that Diane, if you will allow me to call her by her name, Madam Speaker, also speaks French and made every effort to do so. Every time I went over to talk to her, she made an effort to listen to me and answer me in my own language, both orally and in writing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380460">The public does not know that we exchange notes, that is, messages that the pages deliver to ministers. Every time that I, or any of my Bloc colleagues, sent her a written message about a specific matter, she always made sure to answer in French and, above all, to follow up the next day during question period. That is an admirable quality. She was an approachable, empathetic minister. She devoted herself to serving the people we represent. Being a government minister means being the minister of all citizens. She certainly took that to heart. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380461">I also knew her during the period when she sat just over there and her eyes were hurting. She mentioned this in her speech. She stayed on, sitting there. Someone else might have gone on sick leave, but this MP and minister stayed on to carry out her duties while fighting an illness that I am happy to say she overcame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380462">I know that she never held a grudge against me for the time, right after I was elected in January 2006, when I showed up unannounced at her office with piles of shirts from textile workers. I had organized a big rally for textile workers, and Paul Crête and I went to her office to give her five or six garbage bags full of workers' shirts. She thought it was pretty strange that a young MP would come barging into her office like that to deliver shirts. However, she never held it against me, quite the contrary, in fact. As someone said before, she has a great sense of humour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380463">It means a lot to me that the person in the Chair today is a woman, because we welcomed two new female MPs yesterday, which enabled us to reach the magic number of 100 women in the House, out of 338 MPs. It is a magic number. I am sad to see Diane leaving us, because now the number could drop back to 99. I apologize, Madam Speaker. That said, I understand that she needs to take care of herself, her family and her children and take some time to just enjoy life, because it must be said that serving others and being an MP and minister for so long takes up a lot of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380464">On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I hope the next chapter of her life is filled with fun, love and success, and I hope she gets a chance to live life to the fullest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380465">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise and pay tribute to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252564" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation>. We are both from the class of 2004. That was six elections ago. Anyone who can hold a riding through six elections, through the ups and downs, shows an extraordinary commitment not just to Parliament, but to their constituents. That is something the member always showed: her dedication to where she came from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380466">I was thinking back to 2004. In some ways, it seems like such a long time ago. Some things have changed, and some things seem to be similar. In 2004, my hair was dark brown. I notice that the member's hair has not changed at all, so that is extraordinary. I am very, very impressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380467"> In 2004, the EU was all over the media because it was welcoming new members, not because people were leaving. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380468">We had a pandemic in 2004, but it was the bird flu. I do not even remember what bird flu was. It sounds a lot less threatening than COVID-19, but we survived that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380469"> Also, in 2004, the member and I came in as newbies to Parliament, where the Liberal government was announcing that finally, for the first time, we would have strong, firm commitments on environmental targets and we would meet those targets, so plus ça change: We are back at it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380470">There was another element, though, in 2004, and that was the BSE crisis. Both the member and I were opposition critics for agriculture, and I remember that crisis. It was an all-hands-on-deck moment. The beef industry and so many families were in such crisis and the member showed a real dedication then. Of course, she went on to government and I did not, but that is all water under the bridge. Somebody will write a biography about what happened to the New Democratic Party someday, but it will not be me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380471">In that time, I dealt with her on a number of big files because she was the minister of human resources and skills development; she was minister of public works and government services; she had CMHC, I think, and she had citizenship and immigration. Those are all files that really touch people's lives, and they were not necessarily easy files to handle at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380472"> I have to say that the member was a pretty tough opponent. She talks about how nice people are from Haldimand—Norfolk. They do not strike me as tough, but if someone were to get too close into the boards with her, they would get knocked. She would hold her turf. Then I learned that she was from the Hammer. She was born in Hamilton, so now I understand it. I want to pay tribute to the Hamilton side of her because in times of toughness it showed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380473">One thing also really struck me. When we live our lives in politics in the public eye, our privacy disappears very quickly. The member survived real personal tragedy. She survived difficult health conditions and she came in time and time again, showing incredible dignity and determination. She held her seat and she held her files through all those difficulties. That was an extremely admirable thing to witness as a colleague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380474">I want to thank her for her service because, at the end of the day, public life should be an honourable profession. It should be something that we aspire to. She aspired to it, she said, as a little girl. I think that is really, really powerful. I remember as a little boy hearing my grandparents argue about politics: about Stanfield, Joe Clark, Ed Broadbent, David Lewis and Pierre Trudeau. The respect that generation had for political leaders of all stripes was really impressive. I worry, in the rising world of toxic politics and the blame game, that we are losing that old-school sense of the dignity of the office, the dignity of the person who comes forward to represent her people. The member always carried her office with incredible dignity. She never reached down. She never used cheap shots. She always presented the facts as she saw them. Sometimes those facts were pretty blunt, but she said them as they had to be said. Also, she went to bat when things needed to be fought for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380475">On behalf of the New Democratic Party, I want to thank the member for her service to Parliament, to her party, to her constituents and to our nation. I wish her the best. I am not sure, but I am told there is life after Parliament and it is a very great life. I am sure she is going to prove that for us, so I will continue to follow her to see how she charts a new course of life. Thanks very much on behalf of the New Democratic Party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380476">Madam Speaker, what an honour it is for me to be able to add a few words for my dear friend from Haldimand—Norfolk. I am wondering if she knows something that none of the rest of us knows. Her decision that it would be maybe the last time that she could stand in her place to say goodbye makes me wonder what she knows about COVID. What does she know about an election? Maybe it is just better to be safe than sorry, but I really hope this is not the last time she is standing in her place in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380477">I want to add my voice to those of so many friends who say the obvious, which is that the member for Haldimand—Norfolk is an extraordinary human being. She exhibits real kindness. When I was newly elected in 2011 as an opposition MP and she was a powerful minister, there was never any question that I brought forward that was treated as a partisan matter. It was treated in the spirit in which it was raised, as something important for constituents, something important to answer openly and honestly. She was never one, in question period, to duck or to take a partisan shot when a member asked her something about her portfolio.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380478">Somehow over the years we got to be friends. I want to say publicly, and to the hon. member, she may not know how much I admire her, but I think of how she has overcome things that are heartbreaking, such as losing Doug and various health challenges. She really knows how to tough it out, do her job and constantly show a measure of compassion and kindness to the others around her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380479">I have memories of the all-party support for measures she took to help people who are visually impaired to access all of our parliamentary documents. We had fun with that one, did we not? I want to say from the bottom of my heart, I hope we do see each other again and not before a great long time passes. I hope we are able, post-COVID, to raise a glass and celebrate an extraordinary career. I thank the hon. member for Haldimand—Norfolk. I thank her for such kindness. I thank her for her friendship. I thank her for an extraordinary career of public service, and God bless her.</ParaText>

I am not sure where the member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> got this thing about how I never took partisan shots. Maybe she is mixing me up with someone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380482">As I said in my remarks, the most gratifying, worthwhile thing I have ever had the opportunity to do has been to share the lives of my constituents and their concerns with so many members who always stepped up to the plate to help. We have had some challenges, and we still do in the riding. Whenever I was having a tough go, every time I could turn to someone, including my colleague from the Liberals who spoke. Right at the beginning of COVID, I remember the <I>Diamond</I> cruise ship was there, and we were working with a couple who were from my home town. The member was such a treat to work with, and his office made sure they took good care of us to do everything we could to help that couple get home safely and soundly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380483">That is the kind of spirit that we have had here. When push comes to shove, yes we bicker back and forth. Part of that is showtime, right?

              <ParaText id="6380488">Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> talks about an action plan. That is the term used. To us, an action plan means measures, tasks, activities, deadlines and the assignment of responsibility in order to carry out a project. Given the importance of the issue it addresses, although we agree with the principle, we feel Bill C-12 needs some work. Members can count on the Bloc Québécois to propose improvements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380489">We are on the cusp of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on December 12, and we are discussing Bill C-12. I just had to point out the coincidental numbering that makes me laugh.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380490">Canada can no longer say that it is preparing for a transition. The transition should have started a long time ago, long before the pandemic brought all the world's economies to their knees, long before capitalism was forcibly subdued by the cessation of all commercial activity, long before people finally realized how essential the people, mainly women, who work in health care and education are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380491">Today we can no longer call it a transition. We need to call it a leap, as Naomi Klein would say. This bill must be able to evolve in order to play the role it should be designed to fill, namely a permanent tool that includes all of the necessary accountability mechanisms in order to guide this government and future governments toward a new economy and a future that all generations can look to with hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380492">Bill C-12 appears to have glossed over one element that is central to the democratic process, and that is the sacred principle of the separation of the legislative and executive branches. This issue crops up in several clauses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380493">First, in clause 20, there is no independent assessment. The minister will be assessing his own government's work. The bill mentions an advisory body. Why not? It is a good idea, except that we soon realize that it will not be playing the role we would expect. The members, who are appointed by the minister, do not have a mandate to advise on short-term goals or interim targets. Their mandate is simply to provide advice with respect to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380494">The advisory body needs to be independent so it can make recommendations and be heard. As the people who drafted Bill C-12 say, notwithstanding the terminology used at the press conference, an advisory body is not an independent authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380495">In our opinion, it is crucial that a real advisory body be set up. It must be made up of independent experts with the powers, abilities and resources to conduct detailed analyses, advise the government on its targets and plans, collaborate on follow-ups and monitor progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380496">The other issue is that nothing is binding. There are no consequences for not achieving the targets. If the minister thinks things are not going well, Bill C-12 gives him free rein to change the previously established targets. According to the bill, “The Governor in Council may make regulations for the purposes of this Act, including regulations...amending or specifying the methodology to be used to report”. The targets will be changed and the methodology will stay the same, and Canada will once again present itself as a leader in the fight against climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380497">I would like to talk about clause 24 and the role of the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development. Bill C-12 recommends that the commissioner examine the implementation of the measures aimed at mitigating climate change at least once every five years. I would like to remind the House that the recommendations made by the experts in the commissioner's office are not binding, so the wording seems a little wishy-washy to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380498">Currently, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development is playing the role he is meant to play, and the members of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development know what I am talking about. What I mean is that his office deserves respect. He should be commended for the invaluable work he is capable of doing. He should be given powers commensurate with the gravity of the offences, the gravity of the shortfalls and the inaction that his team has noted in many of its investigations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380513">I am in complete agreement with her. The transition should have started a long time ago. We did start it, but that was followed by 10 years of inaction under the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380514">She is right to say that this bill is not an action plan. It is a framework bill. We presented the first component of the action plan in 2016. It was the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change, which all of the provinces and territories adopted. The minister also announced that this plan will be updated very soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380515">I would like to address two points raised by my colleague. She believes the advisory body is insufficient. However, before entering politics, I co-chaired an advisory council on climate change for this government. The council proposed a series of measures, including purchase incentives for electric vehicles and investments in energy efficiency retrofits. A few months after our report was released, those measures were incorporated into the 2019 budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380516">The hon. member also said that there is no external evaluation, yet there is an entire section on the role of the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development. This is right in his wheelhouse, since he is responsible for making sure that the government meets its objectives in various areas. Consequently, I am having a bit of difficulty understanding my colleague's questions in this respect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380518">The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development told the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development that the situation is dismal. In 2011, the Department of Transport received a damning report on the safety of hazardous materials. Two years later, in 2013, a train exploded in Lac-Mégantic. It is now 2020, and nothing has been done. The commissioner needs more powers so he can force government departments to follow up on his audits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380530">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to the government's new bill, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, on achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Fortunately, this is a subject that brings people together more than it divides them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380531">When it comes to climate change, most people agree that we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions if we, and especially future generations, do not want to hit a wall. We all agree that it is our moral obligation to leave behind a planet that is still habitable for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380532">Since climate change is an issue that affects everyone, it has brought together many people who would normally not work together. We all have one thing in common, the earth, and we know that there is no planet B. That is what brought about half a million people together to march in the streets of Montreal on September 27, 2019. That is what motivated a large number of women who did not have much in common aside from the fact that they are mothers, to come together and form Mothers Step In, a group that I had the pleasure of meeting with on Monday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380533">The goal of reducing greenhouse gas production has even gained widespread acceptance among big oil companies like Shell, which announced a program called “drive carbon neutral” two weeks ago. In short, reducing greenhouse gases is such a worthy goal that it is not surprising that there is such a consensus. However, here is the problem: Too often, when we talk about greenhouse gas reduction and net-zero goals, that is all it is—a goal. As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once said, a goal without a plan is just a wish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380534"> Let's be clear: We are not against Bill C-12, far from it. Every step in the right direction is welcome. However, we do regret that this bill takes only baby steps and that time is running out. The climate emergency is very real and is a major concern among Canadians. Although Bill C-12 was intended to be resolutely green, we regret that it is actually a little too dangerously beige.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380535">When it comes time to demonstrate political realism, people like to quote Montesquieu, who said that perfect is the enemy of the good. However, climate change is an exception to that quote. We do not have the luxury to be good. We have to be impeccable. We have a duty to succeed. To use the classic expression, we are doomed to nothing short of excellence if we do not want to be doomed at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380536">Bill C-12 has good intentions. On the eve of election 2019, the Liberal Party said in their platform that they would “set legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to reach net-zero emissions”. The Liberal Party also said it would “appoint a group of scientists, economists, and experts to recommend the best path to get to net-zero”. Then comes Bill C-12: gone are the binding targets, gone are the follow-up and rigorous evaluation by an independent body.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380537">If between the promise and the bill the commitments have diminished, there is genuine concern that the measures that should result from enforcing the law will also diminish if they are not adequately entrenched in the bill in advance. That is why it is important to point out the flaws of Bill C-12, and I am going to speak about at least four of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380538">First, Bill C-12 does not include targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions. The only constraint found in the bill is that the government is required to set new targets every five years. The government can move ahead haphazardly and change its game plan as it goes and as it sees fit. That is concerning because we have seen in the past that this way of doing things does not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380539">From the beginning of its mandate, the government has set greenhouse gas reduction targets, but has never managed to meet them. The development of a plan requires anticipating from the beginning the steps required to carry it out. Moreover, to ensure that the plan works, the government must include benchmarks that cannot continually be lowered.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380540">Second, Bill C-12 is essentially a commitment from the government to assess its own performance. This is also not very promising and it shows that the government does not take this seriously. Pursuant to clause 16 of the bill, the minister himself will write a report detailing the reasons why Canada failed to meet its targets, if applicable, and the actions Canada will take to address this failure. I remember, way back when, we used to correct our own or a peer's schoolwork. We were usually asked to give ourselves or our friends a grade. I do not recall anyone ever failing an assignment under this system. It may be a worthwhile exercise for developing skills to critique one's own work, but it would be a very inappropriate way to grade a final exam before graduation, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380541">I am glad to see that Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> requires that the reports on the targets, regardless of whether they are met, be tabled in Parliament and made public. This transparency is not inherently bad, but without an independent authority to assess the progress, we can unfortunately expect to see some self-congratulatory grandstanding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380542">Third, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, most people are of a same mind on climate. Quebeckers and many Canadians agree on the notion of an emergency. Everyone knows that tomorrow is already too late and that even today is almost too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380543">In recent months, governments, cities and universities in Quebec and Canada have declared a climate emergency. This is not the time to procrastinate. As the saying goes, never leave for tomorrow what you can do today. If we agree on the definition of the term “emergency”, then we must take concrete action very quickly to avoid the serious consequences of climate change. For that reason the government must require that the state respect its own commitments. The law should include a mechanism that will make the government accountable as well as a reporting mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380544">Fourth, the Liberals unfortunately seem to want to always postpone their targets. Not so long ago, in the throne speech, the government said it was going to introduce a plan that would help Canada exceed its climate targets for 2030. Promises were being made for 2030, but the problem is that 2050 is all they are talking about now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380545">They promised to raise the target for 2030, but this is not even enshrined in their climate bill. As they say, those who can do more can also do less. If the government is so confident it can achieve net zero by 2050, it should be just as confident it can achieve one of the milestones needed to reach that final goal, namely reducing emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Therefore, it should not shy away from enshrining this objective in Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380546">The environment no longer has the luxury of waiting for the government to show its goodwill and fight global warming. It is with this sense of urgency in mind that the Bloc Québécois has introduced a bill on climate accountability. We need legislation that will pave the way towards achieving the objectives that will let us face future generations without feelings of shame or failure. This plan must not be open to change at the whim of the current or future governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380547">That element of accountability and predictability is the very purpose of Bill <Document DbId="10866095" Type="4">C-215</Document>, which was introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252929" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation>. I would like to go over the highlights. First, it will integrate Canada's Paris Agreement commitments into domestic law to make them mandatory. It will require the federal government to raise its greenhouse gas reduction targets to the same level as the Paris targets. It will also require Ottawa to lay out a detailed action plan to achieve its targets. It will task the environment commissioner with determining whether the government's efforts will enable it to achieve its targets and with telling the government how to achieve them. Lastly, it will hold the federal government to account in the House if it fails to keep its promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380548">Despite its shortcomings, we will support Bill C-12 because we do not want future Canadians to be disappointed in us or to feel that we failed them. We hope the federal government will support our bill in return.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380581">As I was saying, the mining sector produces the minerals and metals essential to clean technologies. Our forests are the most sustainably managed in the world and provide the foundation of the emerging bio-economy. Our oil and gas sectors are on their way to placing among the lowest-emitting producers in the world, and major players like Cenovus have committed to achieving net-zero emissions in their operations. They understand that achieving net zero is not a regulatory burden, but an economic necessity at a time when our government is making historic investments in renewables such as wind, solar, tidal and geothermal energies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380582">Natural Resources Canada is supporting all these efforts, with over 900 clean technology projects across the country. In total, we are investing nearly $1 billion in Canadian clean-tech innovations. The total value of these projects is in fact more than four times that of private sector investments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380583">Climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our planet, our homes and our way of life. It is a moment that calls for action. The only question is how? How do we continue to meet our needs, power our cities, heat our homes and grow our economy while producing fewer emissions. In particular, with <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, how do we ensure we are pushing forward all the time toward reaching our goal of net-zero emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380584">Right now, our electricity grid is currently 82% non-emitting. We need to get that to 100% and then rapidly expand the clean supply as we electrify our economy. We do that by promoting transmission connections like the Atlantic loop; continuing to invest in renewables like solar, wind, geothermal and storage; supporting the development of new energy sources; and helping remote communities move off diesel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380585">We also understand the need to improve the energy efficiency of our homes and offices, factories, schools and hospitals. That means building an inclusive retrofit economy that hires thousands of Canadians across the country, creating a made-in-Canada low-carbon building supply chain and implementing net-zero building codes for new homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380586">Finally, we are also investing in emerging areas of energy production. Let me take a few minutes to talk about just one: hydrogen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380587"> Global production in hydrogen is expected to increase at least tenfold in the coming decades, accounting for close to a quarter of all the energy used around the world by 2050, and creating an industry valued at as much as $11.7 trillion. Canada can and must capture its share. We are ideally positioned to do so. In fact, name any country where hydrogen is being developed and deployed in a significant way, and the odds are that Canadian technology is at the centre of it. The opportunities are as diverse as the country itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380588">In Alberta and Saskatchewan, we can capitalize on our natural gas sectors to produce clean hydrogen with the help of world-leading carbon capture used in storage technologies, lowering the emissions of every ounce of oil we produce. In Newfoundland and Labrador, we can leverage the extra electricity we produce alongside wind and other renewables for clean hydrogen production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380589">British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec will be able to use waste diversion for increased renewable natural gas production and leverage low-cost hydro power for large-scale clean hydrogen production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380590">Hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels also offer opportunities to reduce diesel dependency in Canada's north, giving largely indigenous remote and northern communities access to clean energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380591">To capture the full range of hydrogen's potential, we are finalizing a national hydrogen strategy, a strategy that will serve as a catalyst for investments and strategic partnerships and make us a top three producer of hydrogen. That is just one example of the incredible opportunities out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380592">We could talk about geothermal, tidal, biomass heating, SMRs, but I only have 10 minutes. Therefore, I will leave it at this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380593">Net zero is an economic opportunity for new jobs with new technologies and energy sources. The market is changing. Investors are making clear choices and putting their money into jurisdictions taking action on climate change. Canadian industry understands the direction markets are moving in and that our industries are following the money. They are already skating to where the puck is going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380594">Canada as a whole needs to get to net zero. To do that, we need a method for reporting and transparency, so we can achieve a net-zero economy by 2050, a national economy that continues to grow and a clean energy future that leaves no one behind. Canada's natural resources will be central to all of it.</ParaText>

Could the member explain how this has anything to do with transparency and accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380599">Furthermore, the member talked about the importance of industry and how it would get onside. Why will the Liberals not say that they will ensure our Canadian energy sector will have representation on the advisory council?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380622">When we are looking at things to help get us to those targets and how we will achieve those targets together, some of the technologies do not exist yet, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252889" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> said. Some of them are accelerating faster than legislation is keeping pace with, such as the move toward electronic vehicles. My constituents in Guelph are really excited to see the banning of single-use plastics, the commitment to plant two billion trees and the work we are doing to conserve our natural spaces. That being said, Guelphites are also challenging me and reminding me that better is always possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380623">This legislation gives us some key reference points as we go forward to see how we are doing in the future to see if we are meeting our goals to net zero by 2050. I am proud the government is acknowledging that Canadians want to be bold on climate action now. The government has to continue to deliver on this call to action and act in direct response to it. I have heard from younger constituents, I have held climate change town halls with high school students, I have worked with people at the University of Guelph who are researching, and everyone wants to see action. This legislation is a way of tracking the progress of the actions we are undertaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380624">Back in December 2015, I can remember being a new member of Parliament and being so proud of Canada signing, along with 194 other countries, the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement included the goal of limiting a global average temperature rise to well below 2°C to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380625">According to the 2018 special report “Global Warming of 1.5ºC” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global emissions must reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in order to limit global warming to the 1.5°C goal identified in the Paris Agreement. Reaching carbon neutrality means achieving a state where human-induced carbon emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are balanced by the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Achieving net zero will require a careful calibration to reflect Canada's unique circumstances, including geography, the importance of the traditional resource economy, shared jurisdiction on the environment, and the natural and technical solutions we will bring forward to hit that balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380626">The Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act does just that. It would help us meet our emissions reduction targets, grow the economy and build resilience to a changing climate. It would also enshrine in legislation Canada’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, which is also a goal of Guelph's city council. To help achieve this goal, emissions reduction targets would be set at five-year intervals for the years 2030, 2035, 2040 and 2045 on a rolling basis, and we have targets going to 2030 to hit our Paris agreements as well that would need to be tabled within six months of this legislation before us today coming into effect. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380627">When we set the target for each of these milestone years, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change must consider the long-term objective of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition, the minister must take into account the best scientific information available, Canada’s international commitments with respect to climate change and submissions from interested persons from across the country, including young people in Canada, technical experts and others who want to be part of the conversation. These targets would be set at least five years before the beginning of the next related milestone year, with the exception of 2030, which would be set within nine months after Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> reaches royal assent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380628">Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> would also require the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to develop emissions reduction plans that would outline how the Government of Canada intends to take action to achieve the targets for each of the milestone years and 2050. These plans would contain the relevant greenhouse gas emissions target, a description of the key emissions reduction measures intended to achieve that target, a description of relevant sectoral strategies and a development of emissions reduction strategies for the federal government operations. The plan would also include an explanation of how each of these elements would contribute to Canada achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380629">To ensure transparency and accountability reflecting the full range of relevant circumstances, these plans would be created in consultation with other federal ministers who have duties or functions relating to the measures that are being taken to achieve the target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380630">In terms of accountability, the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act would require the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to prepare two types of reports: progress reports and assessment reports. Progress reports would be used to provide interim updates on Canada’s progress toward achieving the target for the next milestone year. They would contain updates on the progress that has been made toward achieving the relevant target and on the implementation status of federal measures, sectoral strategies and federal government operations strategies outlined in the emissions reduction plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380631">Assessment reports are the other type of reports, and they would be used to reflect on the last target, the actions of the government, and whether or not Canada has achieved this target. Assessment reports would contain a summary of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions inventory for the relevant year and a statement on whether Canada achieved its target for that year. They would also assess how the federal government measures relevant sectoral strategies and the federal government operations emissions reduction strategies described in the relevant emissions reduction plan contributing to Canada’s efforts to achieve the target for that year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380632">I will also add that this would be audited by the office of the Auditor General of Canada through the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380633">Finally, the assessment reports would include any information relating to adjustments that could be made to subsequent emissions reduction plans in order to increase the probability of meeting subsequent national greenhouse gas emissions targets and any other information the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change considers appropriate. Assessment reports would be prepared no later than 30 days after the day on which Canada submits its greenhouse gas emissions inventory report to the United Nations FCCC for every milestone year or to 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380634">What if we miss the target? The accountability of this piece is that if Canada were to fall behind on meeting the targets for the milestone year of 2050, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change at that time would include in the assessment report an explanation of why Canada did not meet the target and a description of any actions the Government of Canada would take to address the target further. That is typical of what we see from reports coming from our Auditor General. This would ensure the transparency and accountability of the government’s action for all Canadians, as assessment reports would be made public after they had been tabled with either the House of Senate or both the Senate and the House of Commons. On that note, all original and amended targets, emissions reduction plans as well as progress reports and assessment reports would be tabled in both Houses of Parliament, as I said.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380657">Successive governments have, for too long, kicked the can down the road and treated the climate crisis as though it were a problem for our children's generation. That ends now. We are the first generation to clearly see the impact of climate change and we are the last generation that can stop it. We cannot afford to wait any longer. We cannot saddle our children with the burden of a dying world and a sixth mass-extinction event. We must act now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380658">In December 2015, Canada joined 194 other parties in reaching a historic agreement to address climate change, through the Paris Agreement. This historic agreement aimed, at a minimum, to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to keep the temperature increase to no more than 1.5°C. According to the 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global emissions must reach carbon neutrality by 2050 to limit warming to the 1.5°C goal in the Paris Agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380659">Despite what some may claim, Canada is uniquely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world, and in the north, warming is occurring nearly three times as fast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380660">Canadians recognize that we need to act now to avert this crisis, and they will not tolerate any inaction. I know this because in my riding of Kitchener Centre, constituents come to talk to me about climate change more than any other issue. Young Canadians are rightfully frightened by the thought of what their futures will look like if we do not get this under control now, and this is not a debt I am willing to leave them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380661">I was elected on a promise to get Canada to net zero by 2050, and that is what the bill would achieve. Within six months of the bill's coming into force, the minister would be required to set a new 2030 milestone target that exceeds our commitments under the Paris accord and deliver our comprehensive plan on how we are going to reach it. This is the vital first step toward achieving our 2050 goal of net-zero emissions, and every step of the way, every target and every action will be based on the best science available, as well as input from Canadians of all backgrounds and experiences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380662"> That is why the bill would create an advisory body of 15 experts made up of key stakeholders, including indigenous people and other members of the public, who would provide expert advice to the minister in an annual report. This would ensure that we reach not only our 2030 target, but also every target that comes after it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380663"> These targets will be vital to keeping the government on track, but they are only one piece of the puzzle. Targets need to be followed up with action. Fortunately, our government is already moving ahead on that action to ensure that Canada is at the forefront of the green economy of tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380664">The World Bank estimates that climate action will create $30 trillion in new investment opportunities by 2030, and our government is already making sure that Canadians are the ones who will reap those rewards. Through policies such as retrofitting homes and other buildings to be energy efficient and building new clean-energy infrastructure, not only are we taking action to meet our climate goals, but we are investing in the economy of the future and creating well-paying, middle-class jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380665"> We are making zero-emission vehicles more affordable for Canadians and investing in new charging infrastructure so that Canadians coast to coast to coast can confidently reach their destination in an electric vehicle. Electric vehicles are important for decarbonizing our economy, but to truly maximize their potential, we need to ensure that the energy used to recharge their batteries is generated from non-emitting and renewable sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380666">The energy sector will play a key part in our national effort to reach carbon net zero, and the federal government will be there to support it. Initiatives such as the clean power fund will not only help increase our clean energy-generating capacity, but also build the infrastructure that moves energy from where it is produced to where it is consumed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380667">Our government knows that we cannot reach net zero without the ingenuity and know-how of the energy sector. Fortunately, the energy sector is already stepping up and embracing this opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380668">Oil and gas companies such as Enbridge, Suncor and Shell have already made commitments to net-zero emissions, and they are innovating to rise to the challenge. The oil and gas sector has recognized the value behind our approach to legislate accountability and the importance of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380681">Perhaps equally important, in addition to these robust accountability mechanisms, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, an independent body, must examine and report on the Government of Canada's progress within five years of this act's coming into force and every five years thereafter. Enshrining this key oversight into law would ensure that Canadians know if their government is living up to its obligations on climate change and would provide the public with the necessary information to hold us accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380682">The bill is not a plan to make a plan. The bill sets clear priorities, timelines, accountability mechanisms and independent oversight to reach and then exceed our Paris Agreement goals. This vital framework forms the road map to a better Canada and sets us on a trajectory to achieve a clean and prosperous future. However, to achieve that future, we must start today at this key juncture in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380683">When future generations look back at the fight against the climate crisis, they will see this as the moment when Canadians decided not to do what is easy, but to do what is right, and when we chose to look to the future, not the past. The actions we take now will define not only our children's future, but the future of every generation that comes after them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380684">Never before in history has one generation had as much responsibility for the well-being of all subsequent generations as ours does today, so I call on my hon. colleagues to put aside differences and work together for the good of our planet and all humanity.

              <ParaText id="6380699">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak today on Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which is legislation that would create transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380700">Climate change is, without a doubt, one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. It is literally an existential crisis. The House already recognized this when, spurred on by the likes Greta Thunberg in Sweden and so many environmental advocates right here in Canada, we passed a motion in June 2019 declaring a climate emergency, but now it is critical to act and to act quickly on the science that is all around us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380701">If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that public policy, be it in relation to health or the environment, must always be informed by evidence and based on science, and this science is unequivocal. Bodies like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tell us that climate change is real, it is happening all around us and if we, as national governments, do not act decisively, the damage will be irreversible. That is exactly why we must act now, for our children, for our grandchildren, for the future of this country and indeed, it is not hyperbolic to say, for the future of this planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380702">In fact, my view is that Canadians of all ages are actually ahead of us on climate action and climate activism. We saw this clearly when tens of thousands of Canadians took to the streets in September 2019 to participate in climate marches and demonstrations right across the country. We saw this again when Canadians went to the polls in the last federal election in October 2019, returning our government to power based on a commitment to a more sustainable and greener future, a commitment where we stated we would not only meet but exceed Canada's 2030 emissions reduction goals while setting legally binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380703"> Today is an important day. This debate is an important debate, because in tabling and debating Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, we are fulfilling that important campaign commitment. We know how important this issue is to Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380704">I, personally, as the member for Parkdale—High Park, know how important this issue is to my constituents through the individuals and groups who speak to me constantly about the urgency of acting on climate change. PHP 4 Climate Action, Green 13, Green Parkdale, Greenest City, Roncy Reduces, Bloor West Reduces, Humberside's HEAT and EcoSchools Canada are just a sample of the groups that are vocal about this issue and are advocating on this issue. These are groups that want not only a net-zero emissions future, but who are already taking concrete steps now to change their behaviour and model best practices for others. It is through these types of community-led, grassroots initiatives that I know we can, together, build back better and greener coming out of this pandemic. I thank these community leaders for all of their advocacy and for always prompting and pushing for even greater ambition on climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380705">When I had the opportunity to go COP24 in Katowice, Poland, prior to attending that climate change conference hosted by the UN, I consulted these leaders. I asked for their input and advice about the issues to focus on during my time at COP24, and that help and expertise were invaluable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380706">I will turn now to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> and how it fits into the broader plan to tackle climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380707">This historic piece of legislation will help us meet our net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 by imposing a legally binding process for the federal government. Concretely, this means that this government and every future government, regardless of political affiliation, once the bill is passed, will be held accountable when it comes to lowering our greenhouse gas emissions in order to do our part in reaching the overall goal of net zero by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380708">This type of legislation will be pivotal to put us on the path to meet the overall objective identified in the Paris Agreement, which has been spoken about on many occasions during the course of today's debate, and the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels. We have to reach these targets. The stakes of not doing so are simply too high, again, not just for this country but for all countries wanting to meet the 2050 objective, which is an objective that has been agreed to by 120 different nation-states around the planet. In order to do so here, what we are proposing with this legislation is establishing clear milestones to ensure that we are making continued and steady progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380709">Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> would ensure that five-year targets would be set. A progress report and an assessment report would be required for each step. By doing this, we are putting clear measures in place to ensure that the fight against climate change is prioritized and addressed in a transparent manner. We are making sure that if a future government misses a five-year target, it will be held accountable for it by assessing its failure and putting in place a plan to meet its shortfall. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380710">There would be no excuses. The report would explicitly need to mention the reasons why the federal government failed to meet the target, a description of the actions that the government is planning to undertake in order to address the failure, and any other relevant information the minister wished to include.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380711">Further, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> also contemplates an advisory body, composed of 15 members, that would be created in order to assist the minister of the environment in achieving net zero emissions by 2050. It would be consulting and engaging with experts, stakeholders, indigenous peoples and the public. Based on these consultations, the advisory body would be providing advice to the government on how to meet its targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380712">This is an important measure to keep the Government of Canada focused and on track when it comes to reducing emissions and formulating policy that is informed by science and expertise, as I outlined earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380713">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> would require the minister of finance to publish an annual report that explains how the financial risks and opportunities associated with climate change are being considered by departments and Crown corporations in their decision-making process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380714">Let us turn to the issue of milestone years and targets. It is something that has been raised by commentators, and on the floor of this Chamber during the context of this debate. Concerns have been raised, mainly, that the first five-year cycle under Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> commences in 2025, with the first milestone year being 2030. This begs the question of what transpires between now and 2025 under this legislative model. When I reflected on this myself and looked back at the bill, I noted a couple of important points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380715">Hypothetically we could see passage of this legislation, if Parliament undertook the scrutiny required. The first point is that within six months of this bill coming into force, potentially in the fall of 2021, we could have a tabling of the milestone plan and the target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380716">Second, the bill stipulates that within five years of coming into force, again, potentially five years from the spring of next year, the commissioner of the environment, in conjunction with the Auditor General, would examine and report on the Government of Canada's implementation of measures aimed at mitigating climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380717">We have also heard a lot about these progress reports. I mentioned them myself earlier in my comments. A progress report must be tabled, and it would form part of the government's scrutiny and the scrutiny of all future levels of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380718"> The frequency of these types of progress reports is important. That should not be understated. If we were to have a current progress report, looking back on what we have accomplished as a Liberal government since we came to power in 2015, I would posit that progress report would be extensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380719">Why do I say that? No federal government has done more to fight climate change than the current federal Liberal government. Our very first action in 2015 was to participate in the Paris conference. With 194 parties, we also signed on to and led the Paris Agreement shortly after. As soon as we came into office, we decided to unmuzzle scientists, which prompted one Globe and Mail reporter, Mark Hume, to state, “The Conservatives wanted tight control on the message and didn't trust their own experts to be experts. That has all changed now. [The Prime Minister] has unmuzzled the scientists.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380720">In 2018, we championed the development of an Ocean Plastics Charter following the G7 ministerial meeting on climate change. This charter is now endorsed by 25 governments and 60 businesses and organizations worldwide. It aims to keep our oceans free from plastics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380721">In 2018, we put a price on carbon pollution. This concrete action is a pillar of our approach to climate action. It applies to individuals and industries. The current price on carbon is $30 per tonne. By 2022, it will rise to $50 per tonne, as will the climate action incentive rebate, which allows Canadians the opportunity to take those dollars and invest in greener alternatives in their everyday lives. By putting a price on pollution, we are clearly contributing to lowering emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380722">On October 7 of this year, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> provided more details on our plan to ban harmful single-use plastics. This is an ambitious step toward achieving zero plastic waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380723">What is important to underline, as a final comment, is that we also believe fundamentally that the economy and the environment are not dichotomous. This is a false presentation put forward most frequently by members of the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380724">The single thing I will point members to is something that has already been raised in the context of today's debate. We are funding battery vehicles: zero-emitting vehicles. Plants are being opened in Oakville and Windsor, by Fiat and Ford, to do just that. It will embrace a just transition and show that we can build toward a sustainable future and keep people employed at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380725">This bill is part of that broader suite of approaches. It is a critical bill for this generation and future generations. It is one I hope all parliamentarians can get behind.</ParaText>

It is unfortunate not all parties are behind the same goal. I think about four out of five parties in this chamber are. The goal is simply that we have to be heading toward a net-zero-emissions future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380738">I will return to that zero-emission vehicle strategy, because it is not just about opening up plants in Oakville and Windsor that will make zero-emission vehicles. It is also about targets we set as a government. Another part of what we campaigned on was to set a goal that there would no longer be such a thing as an emitting vehicle in this country by 2040.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380758"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="10866025" Type="4">C-205, An Act to amend the Health of Animals Act</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="9">Bill C-205. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="6380759"> He said: Madam Speaker, I know that all of us, when we have the opportunity to stand up in this House, are very proud of representing our constituents. I have stood up in this House many times, but I think this is one of the most proud moments I have ever had as a parliamentarian because I have the opportunity to not only to represent my own constituents, but also farmers, ranchers, farm families and processors in this industry across Canada. I am presenting an amendment to the Health of Animals Act, which I am confident that all members in this House will support, as it will protect the mental health of our farm families, but also the integrity of our food supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380760">I want to take the members of this House back to just over a year ago when I received a frantic phone call from a farmer in my riding. He was extremely upset. He and his sons had gotten up to check on their turkeys in the morning, but when they walked into their barn they found that dozens of activists and protesters had broken onto their farm and into their barns, demanding the release of their birds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380761">What made that interesting is that they were free-range turkeys. They were not in cages or mistreated in any way. They were healthy and happy. The only risk to the health of these animals was actually from the protesters who were on that property.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380762">When I left from Ottawa, I went back home to the riding to meet with Mr. Tschetter and his family. He was completely distraught. He had not slept in days. He did not understand why he was targeted. He had done everything he possibly could to take care of his animals because he knows they are his livelihood. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380763">In fact, he had nothing to hide. When he got into his barn that morning and saw 30 or 35 protesters, he invited them to tour his farm. He invited the media, protesters and activists to walk around to see what he had and what his operation entailed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380764">My bill is really trying to address two things. The first is the mental health of our farmers and farm families, as well as the protection of those families, their workers and the animals they care for. The second is the very important issue of biosecurity on our farms. This is a critical issue as we try to protect our food supply and our supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380765">What my bill sets out to do is a very simple change. It is an amendment to the Health of Animals Act. I really wanted to make it as simple as possible, so we could get the support of every member in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380766">The Health of Animals Act, as it currently stands, has control of diseases and toxic substances that may affect animals, and diseases transferred from animals to humans. However, the obligations and prohibitions within the act only deal with the farmer who owns those animals. There are no protections in the act that deal with individuals or organizations who may break into private property and put those animals at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380767">That is really what my private member's bill is trying to address. I did not want to invent something new. I wanted to have something that was specific to the issue that we are dealing with. I also wanted something that was not a one-off on an issue that happened in my own riding, but something that could address the bigger picture of biosecurity on our farms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380768">I really want to be crystal clear on this to all members in this House. The one thing that this bill is not is a prohibition of protest. Protesting one's view and one's opinion is absolutely anyone's right as a Canadian. We want to uphold that. One's right to protest on public property is absolutely one's right. However, when someone crosses a line by entering or breaking into private property and putting the health of animals and farm families at risk, there have to be consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380769">I think that all of us in this House understand this is not an isolated incident. My staff and I went through media reports and did some research. There have been literally dozens of these types of incidents across the country, touching ridings of every single party in this House, from one coast to the next, in every sector of agriculture. We had 50 protesters at a hog farm in Abbotsford, B.C. We had people trying to forcibly remove animals from a dairy farm in Quebec, and we saw protesters at a pork-breeding facility in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380770">As I said, this really sparked an interest in me. This incident in my own riding with the Tschetter family had an impact not only on that family, but also on farm families across my riding. They inundated my office with questions such as these: Are we free game for protesters and activists? Are we not safe on our own farms? Are our animals not protected?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380771">What really struck me with that protest at the farm in Fort Macleod, which is usually quite a quiet little town, was the fact that many of those activists and those protesters had been on a hog farm in Abbotsford only a week before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380772">This is really the crux of my private member's bill. I do not think these protesters quite understand, perhaps through no fault of their own, the consequences of their actions or the very strict biosecurity protocols we have on farms, which are there for very important reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380773">I know that my colleagues in this House understand that no one cares for their animals, their land and their environment more than farmers, ranchers and processors do. I hope that biosecurity is an important aspect of this bill that we can focus on through our debate this evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380774">When those protesters are coming onto private property and breaking into barns in areas where they may not fully comprehend what is at stake, they are posing a very real risk to a critical industry within our country, and this is very real. African swine fever, avian flu, foot-and-mouth disease, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, are very real threats to our industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380775"> Obviously, this has hurt my riding. Almost two decades ago, we had the BSE outbreak in Alberta. That had an impact of between $6 billion and $10 billion on our cattle industry in Canada, as the second that BSE was confirmed in central Alberta, more than 40 countries shut their borders to Canadian cattle exports. It was a $10-billion hit. Most important, 3,000 ranchers went out of business, including many of my constituents and my friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380776">I can recall ranchers like Grant Hirsche, who found a little processor, slaughtered his cattle, found a used refrigeration truck and drove up and down Highway 2, trying to sell his beef on the side of the highway just to keep his operation afloat. Thousands of ranchers were not so lucky. Almost 20 years later, we are still trying to rebuild our cattle herd in this country. Twenty years later, the impact of that outbreak is still being felt. Many countries are only now reopening their border to Canadian beef.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380777">In 2004, we had a massive outbreak of avian flu in the Fraser Valley. Almost 300 million animals had to be euthanized. The economic impact of that was more than $300 million. To this day, we have to be aware of avian flu. There were some positives that came out of that. We have improved surveillance, improved testing and improved quarantine measures, but, most important, we have improved regulations and protocols around biosecurity, which everyone must abide by.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380778">I know many of us in this House who have had an opportunity to tour the farms and ranches in our constituencies or neighbouring constituencies in rural Canada understand. I visited the Kielstra farm, a poultry operation, this summer. I had to put on booties, a lab coat, a hairnet and a face mask. This had nothing to do with COVID. These are the biosecurity protocols on just about every farm in Canada. Many times these protesters and activists just do not understand this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380779">We have a very big threat facing us right now. I talked about BSE, foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu, but African swine fever is a very real threat as well. There has been an outbreak in China, which has decimated the Chinese hog population. It has spread now through most of Southeast Asia, Central America and many parts of eastern Europe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380780">Were African swine fever to come here to Canada, the impacts would be profound. The pork industry in Canada is a $24-billion industry. That is 45,000 jobs from gate to plate. Seventy per cent of the hogs that we raise here in Canada are exported. That is $4.25 billion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380781">If there is an outbreak of African swine fever in Canada, international markets will close. It take us years, as we learned with BSE, to rebuild that confidence in those export markets to try to regain that global opportunity. The threats of these animal-borne diseases are very real and we cannot take them lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380782">All of us in the House understand the impact COVID-19 has had on our constituencies and certainly on every aspect of every industry in our economy. This is a human-borne virus that has brought our country, and just about every country around the world, to a screeching halt. Imagine what an animal-borne virus could do to Canada's agriculture industry, whether it is hogs, cattle or feathers. It would be devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380783">All of us in the House, if we had an opportunity to walk back in time and do a better job of preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic, for which all of us as parliamentarians take some responsibility, I know we would do that to have a better strategy in place to protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380784">We have that opportunity today to do that with this amendment to the Health of Animals Act, which would protect the health of animals on farm. It would also protect the mental health of our farmers and our farm families. We cannot make the same mistakes we have made in the past. We simply cannot afford an animal-borne disease or virus outbreak on farms or within processing plants across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380785">We have dug ourselves a very deep financial hole as a result of COVID-19 and there are only a few industries that as Canadians we can look to and rely on to help dig us out of that financial hole. Energy would be one; agriculture is the other. If we do not provide agriculture with the resources and the safeguards they need to ensure they are protected, then we leave them vulnerable. I do not think any Canadian would support that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380786">I was encouraged to read a comment from the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> the other day, saying there were unacceptable actions of extremist groups protesting on dairy farms. I know it is a concern of hers as well. Strengthening the biosecurity measures for trespassers on farms, ranches and processing plants are something farm groups, commodity groups and processors across the country support. I have been honoured to have their letters, emails and quotes of support from across the country, which is really buoyed our efforts on this private member's bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380787">I am confident that the Liberal government as well as my colleagues throughout the House also understand the mental health strain our farm families are under right now and the importance of protecting our food security and food supply, especially now as we try to rebuild and come out of this pandemic. This is no time to put our food supply and food security at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380788">I really want to leave this message very clear with my colleagues. I know the opposition to this private member's bill will be based on this. In no way is the bill a prohibition on protesting. People are more than welcome to protest on public property, on the gravel road, on the highway outside the farm fence, but there has to be a line in the sand. That line is when people cross onto private property and put the health of a farm family, their workers and their animals at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380789">We must do everything we possibly can to put protections in place for our food security and food supply. As I said, we cannot make the same mistakes we have in the past when it comes to animal-borne diseases that would devastate our agriculture industry. This is an opportunity to be proactive. I look forward to questions and support from my colleagues throughout the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380798">Mr. Speaker, on December 7, 2019, there was an incident in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380799">Thirteen activists broke into the Porgreg pig farm. They occupied the farm for several hours to stage a protest, causing stress to the animals they claimed to be defending. They were completely oblivious to these farmers' reality and how they love their animals in many ways. This protest ultimately caused stress among the animals, leading to the death of several piglets who were crushed by the sows. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380800">This was a very serious incident, which is why, on behalf of the victims of Porgreg farm in my riding, including both the farmers and the dead animals, the Bloc Québécois supports the principle of the bill before us. We are pleased to support it and completely agree with the principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380801">That said, there is always the matter of shared jurisdictions. How can we address this issue, given that each province has its own animal welfare legislation?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380802">Mr. Speaker, my colleague is exactly right. I have seen too many of these issues where the activists are showing pictures of dead animals. The Tschetter family is a perfect example. They had some turkeys that had passed away, but they were not dead when the protesters got there. What happens is protesters scare the animals, the animals scurry and often trample over their youth or smaller animals. The fatalities come from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380803">I know the protesters have the right reasons at heart. They do not intend to hurt those animals, but, again, it is that misunderstanding of what happens when they go onto those farms. That is why we have proposed an amendment to the Health of Animals Act and not the Criminal Code, so we have something that will address a national viewpoint and not province to province.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380813">I know that the bill was introduced to support biosecurity on Canadian farms and other establishments, which is a laudable objective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380814">I believe I speak for everyone when I say that Canadian consumers are engaged consumers. They care deeply about where their food comes from and whether it is safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380815">I am pleased to report that Canada has one of the best food safety systems in the world, and we continued to maintain that high confidence level in our food safety system during the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380816">In April, the Government of Canada announced $20 million in funding for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or CFIA, to support critical food inspection during the pandemic to ensure that Canadians would have continued access to safe, high-quality food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380817">In my opinion, our country's high level of food safety and security can be attributed to the ongoing work of the CFIA and the robust biosecurity measures in place on Canadians farms and other establishments.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6380818"> It is important to note that the health of animals and biosecurity measures, as was discussed in the speech by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> and in the question and answer period, are a shared jurisdiction between the federal government, the provinces and the territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380819"> I want to take a moment to talk about the role of the CFIA and the Government of Canada in relation to the topic we are discussing tonight, a very important topic I might add.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380820">CFIA enforces regulations concerning the transportation of animals. The government introduced the health of animals transport regulations in February. It is also concerned with the humane treatment of animals at federally licensed abattoirs, or slaughterhouses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380821">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> talked about education between rural and urban. There is a difference between provincial abattoirs, or slaughterhouses, that are licensed to provide meat products within those provincial or territorial boundaries and the federal licensing system, where the meat that is processed goes across the country. Therefore, it is important to recognize that there is concurrent jurisdiction in relation to these two domains. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380822">The provinces also have the ability to introduce their own regulations as it relates to the health of animals regulations and biosecurity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380823">I will leave it up to my colleagues to elaborate on the strong biosecurity measures already in place on Canadian farms and facilities as well as the jurisdictional aspects and existing legal instruments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380824">I want to focus on the Health of Animals Act. I ask that all members be patient as I will be discussing some rather technical concepts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380825">The Health of Animals Act was enacted in 1990. It repealed and replaced the previous act, the Animal Disease and Protection Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380826">The Health of Animals Act is enforced by the Canada Food Inspection Agency.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6380827">With respect to the real purpose of the Health of Animals Act, its long title is “An Act respecting diseases and toxic substances that may affect animals or that may be transmitted by animals to persons, and respecting the protection of animals”. Section 34 is the primary authority in the Health of Animals Act for making regulations. This section gives the Governor in Council, or the minister, the authority to make regulations for the protection and health of persons and animals by controlling or eliminating diseases and toxic substances, and for the carrying out of any other purposes under the act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380828">I want to highlight for all of my colleagues in the House and, indeed, all Canadians watching that three objectives are revealed by these three provisions, the underlying goals of the act. The first is to prevent or control the spread of diseases that may affect animals; the second is to prevent or control the spread of diseases that may be transmitted to humans by animals, which are called zoonotic diseases; and the third is to protect animals from inhumane treatment. There are provisions related to this objective found under part XII of the health of animals regulations, which deals with the humane transportation of animals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380829">I will talk specifically about the contents of Bill <Document DbId="10866025" Type="4">C-205</Document>. One thing that needs to be fleshed out in this discussion, and I look forward to my colleagues' thoughts on this, is whether CFIA would have an additional role. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> gave examples of where the behaviour of individuals, activists and protesters on farms was creating challenges. He mentioned Ontario and Alberta as two examples, and perhaps there are others, that have introduced provincial legislation in this sphere, but there was not a whole lot of conversation on who enforces this. Is this being done by police or CFIA, given the fact that it has the explicit responsibility for this act? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380830">Something we need to consider is whether that would be an expectation of CFIA, whether it would be given a larger mandate and be required to have additional personnel who would also be responsible on farm, because right now it is largely maintained among the federal abattoir-inspected facilities. I asked the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> about this and in his remarks, which I do not have right in front of me, he said that many of these activists do not know what they are walking into or they are not aware. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380831">I will read the provision that he is suggesting we add to the legislation. It says:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380832">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">No person shall, without lawful authority or excuse, enter a building or other enclosed place in which animals are kept knowing that or being reckless as to whether entering such a place could result in the exposure of the animals to a disease or toxic substance</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380833">My concern is if the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> is correct in saying that the majority of people do not know about this when they go on farm and the provision is that they had to know about or ought to have known about it, it may be a difficult threshold for us to make meaningful change on these pieces, but perhaps that could be studied at committee, assuming that it passes to that level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380834">I want to highlight a few things. There are strong biosecurity measures already in place on Canadian farms and other establishments. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> himself acknowledged the good work that Canadian farmers do along with industry, in co-operation with the federal, provincial and territorial governments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380835">It is up for debate, but there are legal instruments already in place to perhaps deal with the issue around whether the provinces have the ability to introduce these types of legislation, as some provinces have already done. There are provisions under the Criminal Code. It is up for debate and I look forward to hearing other members' thoughts on whether prosecutors, who try to prosecute on these particular grounds, believe they have the tools to successfully have a prosecution in these circumstances, which I would agree are unfortunate and cannot continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380836">The Health of Animals Act, which is where it is suggested this particular legislation be added, the private member's bill, is designed to protect the health of animals. I do not think anyone would question that is not a good intent, but I do not know if it is intended to be used as a mechanism to crack down on trespassers. That is why I asked the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> about whether there has been a connection between a biosecurity risk and trespassing on a farm. I do not know what that information is. I asked that in earnest. I hope it is a point that we can discuss in the House, because this bill is an important piece of consideration for agriculture communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380837">I want to bring in the Nova Scotia context very quickly. I am in one of the heaviest agriculture ridings in Atlantic Canada, in Kings—Hants. This has been mentioned by my stakeholders and that is why I have the privilege of being able to speak to this tonight. Speaking on behalf of the government, it does appreciate that the incursion on farms and biosecurity facilities can potentially result in the introduction of concerns and we look forward to hearing more of the debate tonight.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380838">Mr. Speaker, I will start by thanking my colleague for introducing this bill. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252691" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation> said, we will support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380839">I will start with a question. At times, we might wonder if something that happened to us has also happened to someone else. For example, has anyone here ever experienced a break-in?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380840">One of my colleagues raised a hand. I was not really expecting an answer, but I thank him for that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380841">I have experienced a break-in, and I know it can change a person's life. It had a psychological impact on my sense of safety and consequences for my belongings. Nothing I took for granted was guaranteed anymore. I was worried about my family's safety 24/7. I was distressed and did not know what to believe. Personally, I think such an event changes a person's life, changes their habits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380842">Now imagine that the future of one's own business is at stake, that thousands of dollars are at stake or that the break-in makes one responsible for disease or for not having taken proper care of one's business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380843">Colleagues mentioned it earlier, including my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252507" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, whom I commend for his remarkable efforts to speak French. I tip my hat to him. Even though the Liberal Party does not have any tangible measures at least there are people in the Liberal Party making a serious effort. I encourage the hon. member to have a positive influence within his party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380844">As agriculture critic, when we would tour farms or processing plants before COVID-19, we would have to wear plastic from head to toe and wear a mask. People would have to remove their jewellery. They do not ask people to do that just for kicks. They do this for the sake of biosafety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380845">This bill is very serious and extremely important. It makes it an offence to enter, without lawful authority or excuse, a place in which animals are kept if doing so could result in the exposure of the animals to a disease or toxic substance that is capable of affecting or contaminating them. A disease or toxic substance may be introduced by a well-meaning person who wants to water an animal with an outside source that was not subject to quality control. As such the person might jeopardize the entire herd. Let's not forget the people who go near an abattoir or a farm to protest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380846">As my esteemed colleague warned us earlier, this is not about preventing people from expressing an opinion or protesting, quite the contrary. We live in a country that affords its people a lot freedoms that all parliamentarians here respect and want to continue to respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380847">However, we must not lose sight of the basics, such as private property, biosecurity or the food security of our people; these are concerns that we have become extra sensitive to, particularly during this pandemic. It is therefore extremely important to take action, and here is why. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380848">The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's mandate on animal welfare is limited to regulating the humane treatment and transportation of food-producing animals when they are at the slaughterhouse or on the way there. As another colleague mentioned earlier, it is about preventing disease. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380849">It is complementary, but I think the proposed legislation is necessary because it will add to and clarify the consequences. What I like about this bill is that it contains concrete measures, such as prison sentences and significant fines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380850">We have heard all kinds of stories about things that happened in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. Farmers and restaurateurs do not dare report incidents because they figure that if they get mad, they will come back. The government does not have the right to not ensure people's safety. The government certainly does not have the right to not ensure the safety of farmers, the people who feed us. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380851">This does not take away anyone's right to protest. People can protest in the street with placards and on social media. All we are saying is that there must be no unjustified intrusions without appropriate precautions being taken. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380852">I am sure that if these people want to visit facilities, they will find businesses that are willing and all the necessary precautions will be taken, just like the precautions that we as parliamentarians take when we visit farms and we don plastic from head to toe. Farmers are transparent. They have nothing to hide. That is the essence of Bill <Document DbId="10866025" Type="4">C-205</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380853">I want to come back to the incident that happened in Quebec nearly a year ago, in December 2019. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252691" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation> talked about it earlier. It had to do with Porgreg, in the Saint-Hyacinthe region. Those individuals were incredibly courageous, speaking out publicly with the Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec, out of a sense of duty to serve the public. Despite the fear of reprisals, they did it for the public good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380854">In Quebec, this resulted in a temporary injunction prohibiting protesters from getting within a certain distance of farms, so as to ensure the safety not only of livestock, but also of property owners and businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380855">The piglets that died were mentioned earlier, but we did not hear about the disease that ensued. Rotavirus spread throughout the facility shortly after the trespass. Farm officials said they had not seen that disease for 40 years. How could one file a complaint and prove that the protesters brought in the disease? It would be very difficult. That is the problem. The proposed regulations will give some clout to people who might want to take action in that kind of situation. I am running out of time, but I could probably talk about it for a good half hour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380856">Leaving the doors of a hog barn open when it is -12°C outside is reckless. People were there all day. The police were called in to evacuate them one by one. I will come back to my anecdote from earlier. Imagine coming home and realizing that you have been burglarized and, to make matters worse, the burglars are sitting in the living room. Then imagine that the police tell you that it is a tough call because they did not break anything and no one can prove that they were the ones who stole the merchandise. At Porgreg, they put water in the diesel. It is appalling. We have to put ourselves in the farmers' shoes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380857">We have to adopt this measure because it is simply logical. Yes, there are jurisdictions to consider. We are very aware of that and we will be careful, but I think this bill deserves to be studied further because it is essential. Imagine not having any recourse against people sitting down in our own home. We have to adopt this measure now to avoid unfortunate events. I do not want to scare anyone, but we want to avoid that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380858">When one's own business is put at risk by a group of total strangers who came from another province, the interprovincial regulations become very important. It is important that we adopt this measure. The Bloc Québécois will support this bill. When the bill is a good bill, the Bloc Québécois will vote for it. I urge those who brought forward this bill to do the same for the bills we are introducing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380861">The legislation that we have before us, Bill <Document DbId="10866025" Type="4">C-205, an act to amend the Health of Animals Act</Document>, is essentially centred on the danger that exists from potentially exposing animals on a farm to disease or to a toxic substance. Before I get into the particulars of the bill, it might be helpful just to spend a few moments talking about biosecurity and why it is so important for farms. Therefore, I will talk a bit about the experiences I have personally had here in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380862">I have had the pleasure of visiting a couple of farms in my riding, and I will identify two of them: Lockwood Farms and Farmer Ben's Eggs. They are both fantastic egg producers in my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380863">Because I have a small flock of chickens myself, one of the strict requirements was that I have no contact with my own chickens for an entire week before I visited those farms because there is a very real danger that I could unwittingly, or through negligence, transfer diseases like avian flu. I also have a flock of ducks. For anyone who manages fowl, there is a real understanding that disease is prevalent and it is quite a danger, so there was that requirement before I even visited the farm. Of course, when I was there, we had to take great care to make sure that our footwear was clean, that we put on disposable booties and wore the gowns and the hairnets, before we actually went into the barn to look at their egg production facility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380864">When in the barn, we get a sense of why this is necessary. First, avian flu is a very contagious disease and if it were to go through the flock, it would be absolutely devastating. Any farmer whose livelihood depends on animals, whether livestock or poultry, will tell you that their first and primary care is focused on the well-being of their animals. They literally stay up at night wondering about all the dangers that could come, and biosecurity is a huge part of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380865">Another experience I had, going back a few years to a previous life, was when I was a tree planter. One of my tree planting contracts was near Merritt at the Douglas Lake Ranch. It is one of the largest working cattle ranches in the interior of British Columbia and their lands are so vast that they actually lease them out to logging companies. They do selective harvesting of their lands and, as a tree-planting company, we were brought in to reforest. When I was doing the reforestation, there was a real danger of foot and mouth disease, so before we were allowed entry onto the lands, we had to have our vehicles wiped down, the wheels hosed off and all of our footwear hosed off with cleaning agents to make sure that we were not inadvertently transferring the disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380866">All of these examples just help to illustrate the very real concern that exists out there with biosecurity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380867">Given the fact that international trade is such a huge part of agriculture, we have seen many diseases and pests come from other parts of the world, diseases and pests that are novel to the Canadian environment and pose a very real risk. I have spoken to researchers at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, and the number of new diseases and pests entering our borders every year really does keep them up at night. It is an ongoing battle to try to make sure that they're coming up with the best practices and best defences against those diseases. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380868">I also want to highlight the important role that animal rights organizations play. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> correctly noted in his speech, the vast majority of them have the best interests of the animals at heart. Their ultimate goal is to make sure that we have a farming system in place that is treating our animals with respect and making sure that the standards of care are there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380869"> What we face, and I think the member illustrated it very well in his speech, is the balance that we have to have between the public's right to know, the transparency we want to see and the right to protest, and the rights of a farmer to secure his or her property from trespassers, people who may not know how the farming operation works and may not know about the dangers they might be carrying, just simply on the soles of their feet. They could be transporting diseased soil or something in some food they are carrying, and these are all very real dangers for the reasons that I illustrated previously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380870">That is the balance we are confronting through the legislation we are considering. In Canadian law, when it comes to animal welfare, it is primarily our provinces that have jurisdiction over protecting the welfare of animals. Here in British Columbia, depending on what the case is, we have the B.C. SPCA. They do farm inspections. We also have visits from officials from the B.C. Ministry of Agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380871">Going to Bill <Document DbId="10866025" Type="4">C-205</Document> and what it is doing, for the next part of my speech, I just want to highlight the provisions that currently exist in the federal statute that is the Health of Animals Act. If we go through the existing act, we can see that there are number of sections within the act that are already seeking to prohibit. For example, people are not allowed to conceal a reportable disease or toxic substance. People are not allowed to keep diseased animals. People are not allowed to bring them to market or to dispose of them improperly, or to let them out. These are all prohibited actions and they come with some pretty severe fines and penalties, because we are essentially trying to prevent those types of actions from occurring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380872">Where Bill <Document DbId="10866025" Type="4">C-205</Document> steps in is that it is going to insert a new section 9.1, which is aiming to prohibit the entry of persons into a building where animals are kept, if by knowingly doing so or if they were reckless in doing so could potentially expose those animals to disease or a toxic substance. This is important. If the ultimate goal here is the welfare of animals, a person may have noble intentions and may want to see if the animals are being taken care of, but by doing so they may in fact be doing more harm than good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380873">Again, I understand the struggle that is out there, the debate that is going on with the public's right to know, but it has to be balanced against the very real consequences that those actions bring about. As the NDP's critic for agriculture and agri-food, I support the bill. I support the principle behind it. I believe that the bill does merit further study at the committee. That is why I will be looking forward to voting for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380874">In closing, I have received correspondence from concerned people from across the country who are worried that the bill might serve as an effective gag against their right to protest. What I would say in reply to that is that if we look at the specific wording of this act, it is talking about a person entering without lawful authority or excuse. There is nothing in the bill to prevent a whistle-blower, like a farm employee, who is already lawfully there and who witnesses something that they believe is wrong or contrary to animal welfare laws, from blowing the whistle and raising the alarm on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380875">Perhaps what the bill may serve to do is to have a broader conversation on how we instill that public trust and build that kind of transparency so that people understand what farming is all about and the struggles that farmers go through, and also give farmers a chance to inform the public of how a farm operates and what measures they try to put in place to look after their animals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380876">I will conclude there. I will just congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> again for bringing forward the legislation. I hope it is sent to committee so that we can take a further look at it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6380880">Mr. Speaker, I too would like to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> on his excellent private member's bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380881">Before I get into the heart of my speech, there are a couple of arguments that I think are misplaced. Quite frankly, I am a bit frustrated, as over the last couple of days I have been involved in private member's bills that were designed to help the agriculture industry, and we have received support and constructive feedback from both the Bloc Québécois as well as the NDP. I have to say I am a little disappointed in the Liberal Party and in its response to our supporting rural agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380882">Specifically, I would like to address a couple of things that have come up. One is that this is absolutely an area of federal jurisdiction. It is co-jurisdiction, but the federal government has the right. Currently in some of the provincial legislation that would attempt to prevent some of the conduct that is contemplated in this legislation, some of the penalties are less than stringent. Therefore, this federal legislation, which is definitely within the jurisdiction, is also warranted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380883">Secondly, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252507" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> brought up the idea that maybe animal activists will not know about this law, and asked how we could put this law in place. The reality is that there is an old common-law principle that is hundreds of years old that says ignorance of the law is not an excuse. We must be aware of the law. It is part of being a citizen of a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380884">Finally, the other subject he brought up was the idea that, and he did ask it earnestly and I do respect that, whether for one of these biosecurity lapses, protesters had created an outbreak or the spread of a disease, and whether there was evidence of this. I would say, respectfully, to him that before COVID there was no COVID. Before the Holocaust there was no Holocaust. We need to get ahead of things; we cannot stay behind them. The reality is that, whether this has occurred in the past or not, there is the very real opportunity for this to occur, which it appears all parties acknowledge. Therefore, we need to be ahead of these things, not behind them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380885">At this point, I would like to get into the meat of my speech. I can say with great pride that I am the member of Parliament for Northumberland—Peterborough South, a predominantly rural riding where we have, I believe, some of the best farmers in our country. I am honoured to rise in the House for the second time this week to speak in support of the amazing hard work farmers do across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380886">Canadians should all be proud of the amazing work our agriculture sector does. We have incredibly difficult and stringent regulations, which farmers across our country meet every day to make sure that Canadians have the safest, most secure food supply in the world. Whether it be growing grain on the Prairies, produce out in the beautiful province of British Columbia or raising livestock in my province of Ontario, Canadians can rest assured that every step is being taken by our farmers to make sure that food is safe and secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380887">We have talked about biosecurity in Canada, but I would just like to take a half-step back and explain, at least in accordance with the Province of Ontario, what biosecurity is. Biosecurity is defined at the farm level as a management practice enabling producers to prevent the movement of disease-causing agents onto and off of agricultural operations. This includes environmental contamination. Biosecurity, therefore, involves many aspects of farm management, such as disease control and prevention, closed-herd vaccination, nutrient management and visitor control. Although controlling and limiting the movement of livestock is recognized as the most important biosecurity measure for most diseases, many important hazards can be carried on contaminated clothing, boots, equipment and vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380888">While many people outside of the agricultural industry may not yet be aware of the issue of biosecurity, it has become a major concern within the industry as a result of the foreign and emergent diseases that are increasing public concerns over food safety and the globalization of agriculture.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6380889">I would like to comment on the question addressed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380890">There is unfortunately a divide between rural and urban Canada. Hopefully this speech and legislation helps to bridge it. As someone who is in rural Canada, I invite every member of Parliament, whether Liberal, NDP or Green, to come out to rural Canada. I would be happy to show everyone around my farm and the farms in my area. We would, of course, abide by all appropriate measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380891">The concerns of biosecurity will only grow as we have greater farm and population density. This will increase the relevance and salience of biosecurity concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380892">In my opinion, the passing of Bill <Document DbId="10866025" Type="4">C-205</Document>, an act to amend the Health of Animals Act, is long overdue. This is an issue that all Canadians should care about. I hope to see all my colleagues join me and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> in supporting this important legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380893">The protection of biosecurity on farms has always been an important issue for farmers across the globe, but perhaps it has never been more salient than right now. There are currently no provisions at the federal level to protect our farmers, and the incredible products they produce, from trespassers, who may pass on an array of various diseases to their livestock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380894">Meanwhile, we are becoming increasingly aware of many diseases plaguing our farmers and animals across the globe. I want to give an example: African swine fever. Of course, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> talked about this. This is a very real concern for Canadian farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380895">I want to tell the story of Chen Yun, a pork farmer in Jiangxi, China. He noticed that one of his pigs had stopped eating. Shortly after, it developed a fever. He was concerned, so he checked on the rest of his pigs. Within a week, all 10,000 of his pigs had died of African swine fever. This virus is highly contagious and affected every province in China, and it led to the slaughter of half of Chinese pigs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380896">Soon after the outbreak, the fever spread from China to Southeast Asia to central Europe, where it has now reached Belgium. This virus shows the importance of biosecurity and why this legislation is very important.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6380899">Mr. Speaker, Canadians are waiting for a COVID-19 vaccine to help control the spread of the virus and protect our most vulnerable citizens. The vaccine needs to be free for Canadians, it needs to be effective and it needs to be safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380900">In my question to the government, I asked if it was time to return to the model of publicly owned laboratories to develop low-cost medicines and vaccines to serve the greater good. In his response, the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> put forward a list of corporations that have received government funding for vaccine initiatives. That did not answer my question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380901">The government has reserved 414 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with six private sector contracts. We still do not know how much this will cost taxpayers, but we do know that none of the vaccines will be produced here and that Canadians will have to wait for our supply. I ask members to imagine how different our situation would be if the vaccines were being produced here at a government-owned lab, where public health is the motive instead of profit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380902">For 70 years, government-owned Connaught Medical Research Laboratories developed low-cost vaccines and other medicines for Canadians. It was established in Toronto in 1914 by Dr. John FitzGerald to produce the diphtheria vaccine. FitzGerald struck a deal with the University of Toronto to house the lab. As a non-commercial entity, all proceeds were dedicated to the improvement of public health and education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380903">Before the establishment of Connaught Labs, Canadians were reliant on expensive vaccines and medicines produced in the United States, a situation that echoes where we are today. After the discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto, Connaught Labs expanded to manufacture and distribute, at cost, in Canada and overseas. Connaught produced typhus vaccines, polio vaccines and penicillin. It created mass-production techniques that played a crucial role in reducing diseases around the world. Its work saved millions of lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380904">Connaught was a proud Canadian success story, but in 1972 it was sold to the federally owned Canada Development Corporation by the Liberal government. A for-profit model was imposed, prices were increased and manufacturing standards were lowered. In 1986, after years of lobbying from the private sector, the Conservative government sold Connaught to a private corporation, ending the era of non-profit government-supported medical development for the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380905">It is all about the free market and corporate profits now. We still have publicly funded universities doing research, but the breakthroughs and developments achieved in these labs are exploited for profit, not public health. Where is the return on that public investment? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380906">Canada needs a universal pharmacare program, and the government has promised to introduce it. We are the only country with universal medicare that does not have a universal pharmacare program as well. The cost of visiting a doctor is covered but the treatment they prescribe is not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380907">As the cost of medication grows increasingly more expensive, many people are forced to choose between filling their prescriptions and paying their rent or putting food on the table. When people cannot afford their prescriptions, they often end up in the hospital, which is far more costly for all of us. This is not acceptable in a country as wealthy as Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380908">Re-establishing publicly funded labs based on the Connaught model would ensure that universal pharmacare is affordable for Canadians, not a cash cow for the pharmaceutical industry. Let us work together toward this sensible solution. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380909">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the comments by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252987" Type="2">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Affiliation> regarding COVID-19. Let me be clear. The health and safety of Canadians is our government's top priority. The government is focused on, and is implementing, every possible solution to deliver safe and effective vaccines and treatments to all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380910">It has taken rapid action to deploy policy and program instruments to support vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities in Canada. We have established and mobilized extraordinary partnerships with industry, academia and research institutions to fight COVID-19, the most significant global health challenge in recent history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380911">Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government's efforts have focused on a comprehensive made in Canada approach to harness world-renowned Canadian ingenuity and innovation to address this crisis. The government has made investments that are accelerating the development of vaccines and therapeutics in Canada and are strengthening our national biomanufacturing capabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380912">A signature investment is the $175.6 million provided to Vancouver-based AbCellera to advance its therapy discovery platform and to establish a good manufacturing practice facility right here in Canada. This Canadian company's technology is helping advance a world leading monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19 in partnership with U.S.-based Eli Lilly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380913">The government's investments also include up to $173 million for Quebec City-based Medicago, which is pioneering a virus-like particle vaccine created on the company's unique plant-based technology platform. The government's contributions provide funding to Medicago so it can develop its vaccine candidate through all phases of clinical trials and so it can expand its manufacturing capacity to establish a new, large-scale good manufacturing processing facility right here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380914">Another innovative vaccine investment is up to $18.2 million in contributions to Precision NanoSystems Inc., a Vancouver-based company. Precision NanoSystems is working on a novel messenger RNA vaccine candidate and has created lipid nanoparticle technology that provides Canada with a distinct technological advance in the global arena. The government's investments in these projects are growing Canada's capabilities in the most sophisticated vaccine and therapeutics technology and helping solidify world-leading clusters across the country. Among others, I would like to reference messenger RNA vaccines and associated technologies as key examples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380915">However, the development of vaccines is complicated. It depends on supply chains and requires biomanufacturing assets to serve as a safety net in case of unforeseen disruptions to the global production network. For this reason, the government is taking concrete steps to strengthen domestic biomanufacturing capacity. We are doing so not only to reinforce Canada's ability to deliver vaccines and therapeutics for Canadians in the near term, as part of our fight against COVID-19, but also to develop our country's capacity for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380916">A major investment in this area is the expansion of the new Biologics Manufacturing Centre at the National Research Council of Canada's Royalmount site in Montreal which, I might add, is well under way. Once operational, this facility will have—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380919">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for his response. The belief that the private sector in a free market can do everything better than the government is a bankrupt idea. Connaught Labs was proof. It provided affordable medicines and vaccines that saved lives and made Canada a world leader in public health. The free market has brought us more expensive medicines and a focus on profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380920">Canada needs a universal pharmacare system and a publicly owned model of medicine, development and production will make it affordable. Privatizing Connaught Labs put us farther behind in our fight against COVID-19. It is time to go back to a common-sense model that serves the common good.</ParaText>

The government owes it to those on our front lines who are selflessly helping Canadians suffering from this virus. Now is the time to come together with determination to swiftly advance a comprehensive approach and strengthen our capabilities to put an end to this global pandemic.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6380923">Mr. Speaker, I am following up tonight, seeking further information about the government's failure to respond in a serious way to the strategic and security challenge presented to our interests and values by the Government of China. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380924">What we are seeing right now from the government, in terms of its China policy, is a significant shift in rhetoric, but barely a blip of change in substance. When the Liberals became the government, they trumpeted a new golden age with China. They also criticized the previous Conservative government for blowing hot and cold with China. The implication was, I suppose, that there was something wrong with a policy that was a mixture of warmth and pressure. Instead, they wanted to pursue a policy that was all hot and no cold. That was where they started: all hot and no cold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380925">Today the Liberals say that our relationship with China is complex and multi-dimensional, involving areas of co-operation and areas of conflict. This seems to me to be another way of saying that now they have decided that blowing hot and cold is not such a bad idea after all. Aside from the change in rhetoric, we have not seen any change in policy. The National Post has reported that a new China policy was brought to cabinet and rejected, so now we have a new slogan, but no new policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380926">The government trumpets its suspension of the extradition treaty with Hong Kong. This is, though, the lowest of the low-hanging fruit and nobody was on the verge of being, or likely to be, extradited to Hong Kong anyway. Let us not forget that this is the same government that announced exploratory discussions with China about an extradition agreement with the mainland a few short years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380927">Liberals are sending their thoughts and prayers to Uighur Muslims in concentration camps. They say they are deeply disturbed and they are doing absolutely nothing. Their so-called immigration program for people from Hong Kong does not apply to the vast majority of democracy advocates, since most face charges that are not directly related to the national security law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380928">On the substance, Liberals have refused to impose Magnitsky sanctions against human rights abusers in China, refused to expel diplomats who are found threatening or intimidating Canadians, refused to stop Huawei infiltration of our networks in a timely manner and refused to withdraw from the neo-colonial Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380929">Why are we still funding the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank? Why are we sending cheques to a Chinese state-controlled development bank which is building pipelines in Central Asia to advance China's foreign policy goals?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380930">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="253393" Type="4">Minister of International Development</Affiliation> once tweeted that she wanted to “landlock Alberta's tar sands”, yet she has no problem funding the construction of pipelines for China and calling it international development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380931">On the issue of foreign interference, I have just introduced Motion No. 55, designed to push the government to provide meaningful protection and support for Canadians who are victims of foreign-state-backed interference, including from China. Liberals say that foreign interference in Canada is unacceptable, but they are doing absolutely nothing about it. Victims testified on the Hill today that they have gotten the runaround, calling different agencies and being sent to other agencies without the kind of support and assistance that they need when faced with planned attacks by foreign states on themselves and on their activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380932">When it comes to foreign interference, Liberals are like parents who tell their child not to take extra snacks and then, when their child takes a snack anyway, they just shrug and ignore it. Expressing opposition to a behaviour and then ignoring it when it happens is no way to build credibility, as a parent or as a country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380933">The <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> does not have a new China policy. All he has is a new slogan: firm and smart. “Firm and smart” is what the Liberals say. Offering modest criticism of Chinese government policy, while refusing to act to block it and continuing to fund the PRC's neo-colonial policy, is neither firm nor smart. Sadly, the Liberals' China policy is not firm and smart. It is soft and stupid.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6380934">Mr. Speaker, in recent years, Canada has observed, with great dismay, a steady decline in the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380935"> On June 30, the Chinese government imposed a national security law on Hong Kong without engaging Hong Kong's own institutions. The lack of clear definitions and acts of territorial application of the national security law to persons outside Hong Kong, among other concerns, has put Canadian citizens at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380936">We are not about slogans. We have taken concrete action. In response to these developments, on July 3, Canada undertook a series of bold measures to safeguard our interests and the safety of Canadians. The three principal pillars adopted by our government on July 3 consisted of the following: one, suspending the Canada-Hong Kong extradition agreement; two, stopping the export of sensitive items and; three, updating our travel advice and advisories for Hong Kong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380937">I should also add that the announcement on July 3 was preceded by joint statements on Hong Kong, which the <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> forcefully delivered alongside his allies and counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380938"> Among these joint statements, allow me to refer to the following. On May 22, Canada joined Australia and the U.K. On May 28, Canada joined with Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. On June 17, Canada joined the G7 and the EU. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380939">Let me be very clear. Canada has never shied away from standing up for human rights in China, and our voice has been heard loud and clear around the world. In fact, a growing coalition of countries have heard our clarion call for action and have opted to join us in calling for the protection of civil and political rights in Hong Kong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380940">In addition to what I referenced earlier, on June 30, Canada joined 27 other countries at the UN Human Rights Council to express our collective concerns. Furthermore, at the 45th session of the UN Human Rights Council in September, Canada co-hosted a side event on Hong Kong alongside the United Kingdom and Australia. Shortly thereafter, Canada co-signed, alongside 38 other countries, a statement on the human rights situation in Xinjiang and Hong Kong at the UN General Assembly's Third Committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380941">It is important to emphasize here that China's coercive diplomacy has put a strain on Canada-China relations, yet despite pressure and threats, we have continued to forcefully highlight our concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380942"> That said, we are under no illusion that China or the situation in Hong Kong will change overnight. Canada will continue to work with partners, sharing our values, to persuade China to live up to its international obligations and to adopt a more conciliatory approach toward Hong Kong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6380943">We certainly reserve the right to undertake appropriate action in response, as recently exemplified by our <Affiliation DbId="253396" Type="4">Minister of Immigration's</Affiliation> introduction of new immigration measures in response to the situation in Hong Kong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380945">John McCallum told the Canada-China special committee that the government knew of Operation Fox Hunt years ago. This information, new to the public, about foreign-state interference was not new to the government. It knew about it years ago and failed to put in place new legislative measures to support Canadians who were victims. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6380965">The COVID pandemic has been the greatest crisis in the modern history of our country.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6381030">Mr. Chair, I am thankful for the opportunity to rise virtually here today to speak to the main estimates for the health portfolio. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381031">I want to begin by noting that the resourcing plans outlined in these estimates were put in place in early 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic changed the tenor of life in Canada and around the world. Our supplementary estimates (A) and (B), which were tabled later, reflect further investments needed to deliver Canada's health response to the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381032">With this in mind, I will spend my time today updating everyone on the Government of Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Afterward, I will be happy to answer questions about the main estimates or our pandemic response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381033">As our recent case numbers have shown, the battle with COVID-19 is not over. In fact, despite the gains we have made over the past nine months, we are now facing a number of new challenges. Canadians are moving indoors for the winter, where the risk of transmitting COVID-19 is greater, but we cannot stop now. As the pandemic evolves, so must our response. We are building on the work we did in the spring and summer as we pursue new tools that will help us live safely with COVID-19 in the months to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381034">One of those tools is testing. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical to slowing and reducing its spread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381035">Last month, the Public Health Agency of Canada released guidance for a national approach to testing. Developed through the federal, provincial and territorial special advisory committee on COVID-19, the guidance aims to optimize the use of local resources in protecting the health of Canadians. Ultimately, the goal is to expand testing up to 200,000 tests per day across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381036">To increase testing capacity, Health Canada has prioritized the review of all types of COVID-19 tests. To date, Health Canada has authorized 47 COVID-19 testing devices for sale in Canada, and this includes three antigen tests and five point-of-care molecular tests. In addition, Health Canada is proactively contacting test manufacturers to seek their interest in entering the Canadian market, and the Government of Canada has purchased rapid tests in bulk. To date, more than five million rapid tests have been distributed to the provinces and territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381037">Even as we increase testing capacity, we are preparing for the day when a vaccine is finally ready. We have already signed agreements with seven different companies to secure tens of millions of vaccine doses for Canadians. So far, Health Canada has received submissions for authorization of three COVID-19 vaccines, from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, and we expect to receive submissions from other manufacturers soon. Reviews are being conducted through rolling submissions. This allows our scientists to review the data as it becomes available, allowing for quicker review without compromising safety and efficacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381038">In addition, the government has committed $220 million to the COVAX facility. The COVAX facility and the advance market commitment within it are designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world to slow the pandemic. Through this arrangement, we have secured the option to purchase doses for 20% of Canada's population and committed an additional $220 million to provide vaccines to the developing world. By joining this initiative, Canada is contributing to the global effort to develop a safe, effective and accessible COVID-19 vaccine for 172 participating economies across the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381039">We are moving steadily toward a future with a vaccine, but in the meantime, we need to find ways to live safely with COVID-19. Virtual tools and services can help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381040">When the pandemic first hit in March, the provinces and territories moved quickly to put into place temporary physician billing codes and new digital tools so that Canadians could continue to get the health services they need. On May 3, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced $240.5 million to support this work through virtual care and digital tools, such as secure messaging and video conferencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381041">Since then, the Government of Canada has continued to provide a suite of tools to help Canadians stay informed and healthy during the pandemic. This includes tools like the COVID trends website and the Canada COVID-19 mobile app, both of which provide reliable, up-to-date information on the pandemic in Canada. ArriveCAN, by contrast, helps travellers comply with restrictions at the border by allowing them to submit their information digitally. The COVID Alert app allows those who have tested positive for COVID-19 to alert others of possible exposure.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6381042">Finally, the Wellness Together Canada online portal provides Canadians with free and confidential psychological and substance use services remotely. These services are provided in both official languages, with instantaneous translation available for phone counselling in 200 languages and dialects. So far, more than 463,000 Canadians have reached out for support through this portal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381043">Tools like these are going to continue to be essential as the pandemic continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381044">The COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed a number of weaknesses in our society, and it is up to us to learn from and act on them. This brings me to long-term care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381045">People living in these facilities were hit hard by the first wave of the pandemic. Many fell ill and far too many people lost their lives. We cannot let that happen again. That is why, although long-term care falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, our government has committed to working with the provinces and territories to set new national standards for long-term care so that residents get the best support no matter where they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381046">As is the case with so many public health issues, a co-operative and coordinated approach is essential. We were able to put in place public health surveillance for COVID-19 very quickly, with all levels of government working closely to share information. However, even so, the pandemic has shown us that we need to improve public health data and systems in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381047">That is why, as part of the safe restart agreements with the provinces and territories, we are investing $4.28 billion to expand our testing and contact-tracing capacity and to enable rapid and efficient case reporting, as well as access to data to inform public health decision-making. This funding will support efforts by the federal, provincial and territorial governments to leverage the existing data infrastructure, and it allows us to work together to accelerate the development of data standards. It will also facilitate access to public health data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381048">Time and again we have seen that fighting COVID-19 is a team effort and that we all have a role to play. For the departments and agencies of the health portfolio, it is our top priority. We are committed to leading Canadians safely through this crisis. We will stay vigilant, we will learn from our experiences and we will adjust our approach as new information becomes available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381049">I want to say to all Canadians that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and we will get there. We just have to keep working together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381055"> In fact, $500 million of the safe restart agreement funding was targeted for mental health and substance-use services. The funding can be used in any way that addresses the immediate needs of the provinces and territories related to staffing, human resources, wraparound care, harm reduction and evidence-based treatment supports and services, including enhancement to workforce stability and retention plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381056">I want to thank the individuals who are working so hard on the front lines, supporting people with mental health and substance-use issues, especially during this difficult time. I know that oftentimes, the front-line workers working in these areas also experience trauma. That is why the creation of working training plans, mental health first aid and trauma-informed practices are all good for the people who need the supports and for the people who are providing them.</ParaText>

Canadians need to know that we will get there together and that we will stand strong with them as we work toward eliminating COVID-19 from Canada and, indeed, around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381060">We know that however much optimism we have about getting to the end of COVID, it still represents a high-degree period of stress and anxiety for many Canadians. That is why we launched, early on in the pandemic, Wellness Together Canada. Back in April, we knew that there were going to be challenges for Canadians as we were asking people to stay home, as they were being disrupted from their everyday lives and as they were worried about their jobs, their livelihoods, their health and the health and safety of their loved ones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381061">We launched this portal in April. It provides free incredible mental health and substance-use supports. It is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to Canadians. It is available in both official languages and there is translation for over 200 other languages. In fact, people can get free access to social workers, psychologists and other professionals by phone and by text. We have seen an enormous take-up of this service, and we encourage all Canadians who are struggling or who have family members who are struggling to use this free resource, which is available to all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381064">Mr. Chair, that is a great question. In fact, for those people without Internet access, they can access confidential chat sessions with social workers, psychologists or other professionals by phone or by text. To get started, there is a dedicated phone line for program navigators. Those program navigators stand by to help Canadians access the resources that are best suited to meet their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381065">This is really a unique service that is offered by the federal government directly to Canadians, which is very tailored to each person's specific needs. Again, I would encourage all members to let their constituents know about this additional free service. Some people in communities do not have benefits.

I want to commend our health critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252689" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation>, who is undoubtedly here and following our work very closely. I want to thank the Minister of Health for being here this evening. She is here to get grilled, so to speak, until late tonight. I was a minister during the estimates process in Quebec, and I went through the same kind of thing. It is not necessarily easy, but it is always interesting. I also want to thank the members of all stripes who are participating in this process. I commend them for being here.

I thank them very much for being here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381074">I am not my party's health critic, but I am the critic for intergovernmental affairs. One thing that has surprised me since coming back to the House of Commons is that the federal government is always quick to jump in and interfere in areas under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. I should not be surprised to see the same old, same old, as they say. However, the government does not always step up when it comes to taking care of its own business. I would even say that it neglects to take care of its own business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381075">It makes us wonder whether the government should perhaps try focusing on what it has to do, rather than always wanting to meddle in the provinces' jurisdictions, in areas where it has no authority. At the height of the crisis, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was, as usual, giving lectures. I say he was giving lectures because, like everyone, he was horrified by what happened in seniors' residences in Quebec, Ontario and now other provinces, particularly in Quebec's long-term care homes. Obviously, we were all horrified by what happened. I would not want anyone to think that the MNAs in Quebec City were any less horrified than we were here in Ottawa. No one in the National Assembly, at Queen's Park or in any other legislature in Canada wanted this to happen. No one wanted our seniors to end up in the situation that many of them found themselves in at the height of the crisis and are still in today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381076">The federal government saw a gap. It said that Quebec and the provinces were unable to manage this properly, so it decided to create national standards. Ottawa does not run any hospitals or seniors' homes, but Ottawa is going to create national standards because even though it has no experience in the matter, Ottawa always knows best and knows how things should be done. This is not a federal matter, but Ottawa knows best and will tell us how it works. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear that the federal government cannot even manage its own affairs, as we saw with the Wet'suwet'en crisis. What did the Prime Minister say when I told him he does not run any hospitals? He replied that no, he does not, but that the federal government does provide health services to indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381077">I want to clarify something. Off-reserve health services are the responsibility of the provinces and Quebec. They are the ones who provide those services to indigenous people. It is obvious how negligent the federal government is when it comes to the health of indigenous people when a few communities still do not have access to clean drinking water in this day and age. They do not have clean drinking water in 2020 in a G7 country. They do not have clean drinking water.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381078">I think a lot of people, including people in Quebec City, are horrified by that. They think we should probably set provincial standards to make it clear to the federal government that it is not doing its job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381079">As Quebec's former public safety minister, I know that the federal government is not doing its job when it comes to police services. In northern communities, police services are provided by either the Sûreté du Québec or an indigenous police force, even though the Government of Quebec is in no way responsible for such services. In fact, Quebec taxpayers are footing the bill for police services in indigenous communities because the federal government is failing to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381080">Quebec had to create standards to make up for what the federal government was not doing. Now the federal government is saying it is going to show us how things should be done in seniors' homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381081">Let me say a bit more about the pandemic, because that is top of mind for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381082">As the Bloc Québécois's parliamentary leader astutely pointed out today, the federal government should have moved quickly to close the borders to prevent the virus spreading in Quebec and Canada, but it did so days, nay, weeks, too late, after the horse was out of the barn. As our colleague said, it was a failure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381083">The federal government should have approved rapid tests. It should have done it quickly so we could take samples, run an analysis and get results quickly. That is the crux of the problem, and it is critical in the fight against a pandemic. However, the government dragged its feet and it took weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381084">The federal government should have increased health transfers, not just to deal with the pandemic, but also to ensure the normal delivery of health services. For those who may not know this, seniors care is not covered by the health transfers. That means Quebec covers 100% of the operating costs of long-term care facilities. The federal government does not invest one cent, yet it wants to impose national standards on us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381085">The federal government already imposes so-called national standards. Under the Canada Health Act, five conditions must be met to obtain the meagre 17%, or perhaps just a little more, that the federal government deigns to send for health care. It originally promised to pay 50% of the cost. It did not keep its promise, and now it wants us to trust it to establish national standards for seniors' residences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381086">The government should have increased health transfers. It is constantly bragging about the $19 billion it says it sent to the provinces to combat the pandemic. The second wave has hit. It is time for the federal government to come back with more funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381087">The federal government should have secured vaccines, but we have learned that the people of Mexico will be vaccinated before the people of Canada. Unbelievable. We may have reserved the largest number of vaccine doses, but that does not do us any good if they are not being administered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381088">I see that my time is running out, so I will wrap up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381089">I have to wonder if the federal government deliberately kept vulnerable populations vulnerable as a way to justify the introduction of these so-called national standards for our seniors after the fact. That would be despicable if true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381090">I hope that the federal government will do what the Government of Quebec is asking and give a date for when vaccinations will start. In the meantime, we are living in uncertainty. No one has the slightest idea when the vaccine will start being administered in Canada. Will it be in January? In July? Will it be this year, next year or the year after?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381091">Nobody knows. All we know is that everyone in the world will get vaccines first, and then there might be some left for Quebec and Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381092">I will now ask the Minister of Health my first question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381093">How can the federal government lecture the provinces and Quebec on how to take care of our seniors, when it did such a poor job with its own responsibilities, including securing rapid tests and vaccines in order to get the vaccination process under way as soon as possible in Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381094">We still do not have an answer on when it will begin, though not for lack of asking.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381095">Madam Chair, I will spend some time correcting some of the misinformation in my hon. colleague's speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381096">Let me first talk about the work we have done to support Quebec and Quebeckers through COVID-19. Quebec received over $5 billion in the safe restart agreements. That was for testing, contact tracing, data, long-term care, mental health and a variety of other supports. In fact, Quebec has received in total supports from the federal government, including supports for people and businesses, $36 billion. This is good news for Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381097">I will also say the guidance for long-term care homes the member opposite is talking about is national guidance, which was created with all medical officers of health at the table, including Dr. Arruda, who I know is serving Quebec tirelessly during the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381098">That national guidance was created with all medical officers of health early on, as we knew that if COVID-19 were to get into vulnerable congregate settings such as long-term care homes, it could have very tragic consequences. This is exactly what we saw in the province of Quebec and around the country in the first wave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381099">That is why, when the province asked for help through the deployment of the Canadian Red Cross and the Canadian military, Canadians sprung into action. I am so grateful for the work of the Canadian Armed Forces for helping Quebec out during a very difficult time. We still have a couple of hundred, if not more, people deployed right now in Quebec. I can get the member the exact number. We also have 296 Canadian Red Cross staff in 14 homes in Quebec right now, paid for by the federal government. This is in support of Quebeckers, who are struggling through the pandemic like all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381100">The last thing I will say is that this is a time for all provinces, territories and the federal government to pull together, because that is how we will get through this. When we support each other, we are there for each other with money, resources, staffing and support. That is exactly what we are doing at the federal level, making sure we spare nothing to support the provinces and territories as they deliver on their health care responsibilities.</ParaText>

However, Quebeckers pay for these armed forces, and it is only logical that when the need arises, as it does overseas, the armed forces are there to help. They were there, and that is quite fortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381103">Let's talk about universal pharmacare. There is one thing that the federal government can do something about without putting its grubby hands on universal pharmacare, a program that Quebec already has, and that is the price of drugs. Again, Ottawa is dragging its feet, which hurts those who need access to drugs at a reasonable price.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381171">Madam Chair, I am pleased to rise virtually from my home this evening to speak about the actions taken by the government to address the broader consequences of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381172">This pandemic is the biggest public health crisis that we have experienced in our lifetime, and that is something with which most everybody in the House agrees. It has had profound and unprecedented impacts on the health, social and economic well-being of people in Canada. Our top priority continues to be to protect the health and safety of all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381173">COVID-19 has underscored that our health, our economy and our society are closely intertwined. The health of Canadians is strongly influenced by the social and economic conditions in which we are born, live, learn, work and play. The pandemic has also shown us that threats to public health can have broad societal impacts both directly and through unintended consequences of public health countermeasures. These broader consequences include interruptions to education among our children and youth and widespread unemployment and economic instability among working-aged and older Canadians. We have seen increases across a range of health outcomes and risk factors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381174"> For example, more people are indicating that they are experiencing poor mental health problems, problems with substance use, intimate partner and family violence, sedentary behaviour, food insecurity and housing instability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381175">We are also reminded that while COVID-19 is affecting us all, it is not affecting all of us equally. Some Canadians are shouldering a far heavier burden than others in terms of the health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic. These groups include seniors; children and youth; women; workers providing essential services, such as those in hospitals, residential care settings and the food supply chain; migrant workers; low-income and precariously employed workers; racialized populations; indigenous peoples; and people living with disabilities. In many cases, these disproportionate impacts are linked to pre-existing vulnerability inequities in society, which have only been further heightened due to the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381176"> For example, long-term care residents have been hit the hardest, accounting for approximately 75% of COVID-19-related deaths as of November 19. We are also seeing evidence that communities with a higher proportion of visible minorities are experiencing higher infection mortality rates from COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381177"> In Toronto, for example, people who identify as members of a racialized group make up 52% of the total population, yet, as of the end of the September, have accounted for nearly 80% of confirmed COVID-19 cases where race data was reported. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381178">The social and economic tolls of the pandemic and the necessary public health countermeasures are also unevenly felt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381179"> For example, women, racialized Canadians, lower-income earners and young people bore the brunt of losses at the beginning of the pandemic and have experienced a slower pace of economic recovery. School closures and the shift to online learning have created particular challenges for families with fewer financial resources or less access to high-speed Internet and computing devices, which may compromise their children's educational performance and social development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381180">Increased economic instability has widened and deepened food insecurity in Canada, especially for lower-income households that may already face higher levels of financial, material, physical and mental stress. Public health measures put in place to mitigate COVID-19, such as physical distancing and quarantine, have created additional challenges for survivors of family violence and the organizations that serve them. These unequal social and economic impacts may, over time, lead to widening health and social inequities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381181">The unprecedented nature of this public health threat has called for an unprecedented government response, and this is precisely what we have sought to deliver. Since the start of the pandemic, the Government of Canada has taken extraordinary steps to address the broader health, social and economic impacts of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381182">Recognizing the importance on the mental health of Canadians, the Public Health Agency of Canada has provided additional funds to address the increased demand for crisis support services. These include $7.5 million to support Kids Help Phone in providing mental health support services to young people during the COVID-19 pandemic; and $21 million for the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and its partners to implement a pan-Canadian suicide prevention service that provides access to 24/7 bilingual crisis support from trained responders. This service is currently providing crisis support via voice 24/7 and via text in the evening hours.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6381183">The Government of Canada has also invested $46 million to date to support a new mental health and substance use support portal that the minister spoke of earlier, Wellness Together Canada. The portal provides Canadians with free access to credible information and supports to help address their mental health and substance use issues. Canadians can access different levels of support, depending on their needs, ranging from information to self-assessment tools to connecting to peer support, social workers, psychologists and other professionals for confidential texts or phone sessions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381184">As the pandemic has unfolded in Canada, it has become clear that we need to improve our understanding of and our ability to prevent and respond to the impacts of COVID-19 among vulnerable populations in Canada. Accordingly, we are working with our partners to gather more detailed and complete data, including by race, ethnicity and indigenous identity. Federal, provincial and territorial public health partners have agreed to a new national data set for COVID-19, which includes new variables to help understand the impact of racialized groups in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381185"> In addition, we are also funding research activities to generate urgent evidence to support decision-making during the pandemic through a range of research grants. Studies are under way to analyze changes in mental health, self-harm, suicide attempts and substance-related harms during the COVID-19 period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381186">Studies are also under way to identify other impacts of the pandemic, such as attitudes and practices related to COVID-19 and containment measures, daily mobility and changes in social activities, social isolation and stigma, and food security. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381187">Tragically, in many communities, COVID-19 is worsening the parallel public health crisis of opioid overdoses. In response, we have taken action to ensure communities have the tools and support they need to keep people at risk of overdose safe during the outbreak, including additional funding for safer supply of products and overdose prevention sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381188">We are continuing to deliver our regular public health programs for Canadians under these unprecedented circumstances and working closely with funding recipients to find innovative solutions to adapt their community-based initiatives to the pandemic context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381189">We have all seen the promising early results of several global vaccine candidates in the news. The Government of Canada continues to actively work to secure access to these and other vaccines and treatments to protect Canadians from the virus and support our recovery from the pandemic. Particular attention is being paid to ensuring that the rollout of any future vaccines prioritize high-risk populations and those who help keep our pandemic response, economy and society running.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381190">The immunization partnership fund supports Canadian initiatives to improve vaccination confidence and uptake. Our government has continued to invest in the health of Canadians by extending this program for two additional years to ensure that Canadians, including those who are most marginalized, have the information and supports they need to confidently receive COVID-19 and other life-saving vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381191">Beyond the health portfolio, the government has marshalled a whole-of-federal government response to protecting Canadians from the broader consequences of COVID-19. Key measures include direct financial supports for Canadians impacted by the pandemic, including through the Canada emergency response benefit, the Canada recovery sickness benefit and the Canada recovery caregiving benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381192">We have also invested millions of dollars to provide help for Canadians experiencing food insecurity and homelessness; for seniors facing barriers to accessing essential services; for victims of stigma, racism and discrimination; and for women and children fleeing violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381193">Through the safe return to class fund, the federal government provided $2 billion to support the reopening of schools and to keep kids and staff safe in the classroom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381194"> Through the safe restart agreement with provinces and territories, we have invested over $19 billion to support the safe restart of Canada's economy. Recently we also announced $1.5 billion to help Canadians in under-represented groups and those in sectors that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, such as construction, transportation and hospitality, to quickly access supports to re-enter the workforce.</ParaText>

COVID-19 has revealed the best of our systems, structures and behaviours, while also exposing the gaps that need to be addressed. It has revealed long-standing social and economic weaknesses that have placed our most vulnerable members of society at risk.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381199">Before I start, members have probably noticed this caterpillar on top of my lip, this crazy moustache. Of course, the minister knows why I am growing this mo. It is because it is Movember and Movember focuses on men's mental health and suicide prevention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381200">Timely access to health services is of critical importance when one is faced with mental health and addiction issues. As such, the Government of Canada has committed to work with the provinces and territories to increase the availability of high-quality mental health and addiction services for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381201">As we focus on keeping ourselves, our families and our loved ones physically safe and healthy, we are seeing that the pandemic is also having substantial mental health impacts that require attention and support. Could the minister please tell us what the government is doing to deliver on its commitment to improve access to mental health services for Canadians? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381202">More specifically, what is Canada's health research investment agency, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, doing to support the mental health of Canadians, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381204">I am so thrilled he is talking about men's mental health because we know men struggle just as much as women do. Oftentimes society stigmatizes men who are struggling. It is harder for them to reach out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381205">It is harder for men to access services for a whole bunch of reasons, but we have to stand together. This is a perfect example of exactly that, a man advocating for better men's mental health. I thank the member for highlighting the need for men's mental health services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381206">It is very important that we better understand mental health and substance use because this is one of the areas where I think Canadians struggle. Sometimes they get access and the help they need, but access does not always lead to the kinds of improvements they need in their mental health or the mental health of their loved ones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381207">As a member of Parliament and a candidate in a federal election, I hear many stories when I knock on doors to talk to people about the things that concern them or they wish were better in their lives. Frequently, one of the things people talk about is access to mental health care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381208">That is why our government has been focused so significantly on supporting the provinces and territories with fiscal transfers dedicated to mental health services, as well as funding for innovative and timely research through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. It is a $13.5-million investment to date to provide evidence to decision-makers on mental health responses in the context of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381209">This is important because we are seeing a worsening of people's mental health and substance use in this time of extreme stress, grief and loneliness. Combined with Wellness Together Canada, the investment through the safe restart agreement, we have already made investments in the capacity of the provinces and territories to deliver on mental health services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381210">With our commitment to supporting virtual care, and ensuring Canadians have free access to professionals through Wellness Together, we are taking this situation very seriously. I thank the member for his advocacy and expertise in this area.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381308">One thing to note about the pandemic is that from day one, this government took it seriously.

              <ParaText id="6381309">I know some have compared us with our neighbour to the south this evening. We do not want to see even one death, obviously, but the reality of the situation is that our death rate is one-third the rate, if not better, of our neighbours to the south. I believe strongly that this is the result of the serious action that has been taken on this file, the way the minister has responded and the way that the government has responded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381310">I have said many times in the House, and it bears repeating, that we went from the World Health Organization declaring a global pandemic to getting money in the bank accounts of 5.4 million Canadians in one month and four days. That is action from a government that is taking this extremely seriously and is interested in protecting its citizen. It has been there with Canadians every step of the way.

              <ParaText id="6381327">Let us get to the topic at hand today with respect to the vaccines, which everyone is spending a lot of time talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381328">There is criticism coming from members of the opposition. That is their job. Their job is to push the government to make sure the government is doing everything it can to properly bring forward the right responses. However, the reality of the situation is that the groundwork has been laid by the government, by preparing to vaccinate Canadians, investing in domestic projects, negotiating advance purchase agreements with several countries, getting us the largest portfolio available that any country has secured given the various options, enabling the regulatory process to be expedited when the time comes and investing in the necessary infrastructure and supplies to make sure that when the vaccine comes, we are prepared to make sure it rolls out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381329">I am extremely proud of this government's response to date. It has been, in my opinion, exceptional in the way it has supported Canadians and provided the resources and supports that Canadians have needed, as well as in the way it has worked with the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381330">I will point out one last fact. If we look at the amount of COVID relief spending in the province of Ontario alone, 97% of that came from the federal government, because the federal government understood the reason people needed to be absolutely protected throughout the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381331">My first question for the minister is about the bilateral agreement between the federal government and the provincial governments. It relates to the COVID Alert app specifically. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381332">Canadians are proud of the universal, publicly funded health care system, yet we have an aging population with greater risks of chronic conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381333">They expect all governments to work together to continue to improve it. The pandemic has underscored that this is critical and that we need to find new and better ways of delivering care. Targeted investments are needed in critical areas of health for the health care system to improve access to high-quality health care that Canadians can access safely at home and that is not dependent on an individual's ability to pay. This includes a full range of health care services, including home and community care and support for mental health and substance use issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381334">The government's previous mandate letter outlined the need to complete the bilateral agreements with each province and territory. These bilateral agreements supported a targeted federal investment of $11 billion over 10 years and should result in measurable improvements with clear public reporting on outcomes achieved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381335">I am curious if the minister can update the House on when the Government of Canada will see results from these investments. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381437">The Government of Canada remains deeply concerned about the devastating impact the overdose crisis continues to have on people, families and communities across the country. Since 2016, over 16,300 Canadians have lost their lives to opioid-related overdoses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381438"> Tragically, thousands more Canadians are experiencing harms related to problematic use of various substances, including methamphetamines and alcohol. Problematic substance use impacts families, friends, communities and loved ones from all walks of life, creating losses felt by tens of thousands of people. The crisis is so severe today, no community remains untouched.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6381439">We have been living with the overdose crisis for a long time and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this tragic crisis. A year ago, we could see an improvement as the number of overdoses and deaths in some of the most affected areas was steadily decreasing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381440">However, everything changed with the emergence of COVID-19. Since March 2020, several provinces and territories have reported historic levels of opioid-related deaths and harm.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381441">Recent reports from Ontario have shown that there was a 38% increase in opioid-related deaths in the first 15 weeks of the pandemic compared with the 15 weeks prior. It is predicted that if opioid-related deaths continue at the current weekly rate, there will be over 2,200 lives lost in the province by the end of the year. This will be a 50% increase in deaths compared with 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381442">We know that 1,048 people in British Columbia died between March and September of this year as a result of overdoses. To put this in perspective, this is approximately four times the number of people in British Columbia who have died from COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381443">Other jurisdictions across the country are pointing to similar trends. For example, Alberta reported a record high of 301 opioid poisoning deaths from April to June 2020. This was more than double the number that occurred from January to March 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381444">Saskatchewan has reported 296 suspected and confirmed drug-related deaths so far in 2020, breaking the record total in 2018.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381445">In Quebec, Montreal recorded the highest number of overdoses in over five years in July. Unfortunately, this spike lasted until October in Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381446">In short, in light of these reports and the available data, 2020 is on track to becoming the deadliest year in Canada's history in terms of overdose deaths.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6381447">There is no doubt that several contributing factors have led to the surge in overdose deaths, yet there are two that are particularly significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381448">First, public health measures related to COVID-19 for physical distancing, self-isolation and worker safety have contributed to reduced availability, and utilization of, substance use treatment and harm reduction services. For example, there are reports of significantly decreased foot traffic at supervised consumption sites. In some cases, there have been site closures. With over 2.3 million visits nationwide and not a single overdose death, we know that these services save lives when they are utilized. Social distancing and lockdown measures have led to the unintended consequence that more people have been using drugs alone, which considerably increases the risk of overdose and death, and when people are isolated they cannot reach out for help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381449">Second, border closures have had an impact on the supply of illegal drugs. We are hearing from law enforcement, and from people working on the front lines, that the availability and composition of street drugs has worsened during COVID-19. They are seeing highly toxic synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil appearing more frequently in street drugs. The consequences of this reality are unsurprising. More people are experiencing overdose deaths and other drug-related harms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381450">Since 2016, the government's approach to the overdose crisis has been comprehensive, collaborative and guided by our federal drug strategy: the Canadian drugs and substances strategy. The Canadian drugs and substances strategy takes a public-health-focused approach and lays out our framework for evidence-based actions to reduce the harms associated with substance use in Canada. It includes four pillars: prevention, treatment, harm reduction and enforcement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381453">The government has taken action to implement a number of measures to address the overdose crisis head-on at the ground level, including supporting communities so they have the tools they need to help keep people at risk of overdose safe. We listened to the provinces and public health professionals to ensure we understood their challenges. At their request, we changed federal regulations to make it easy for people with substance use disorder to access the medications they needed. Specifically, we issued a class exemption for pharmacists to make it easier for people to access medications during the pandemic, while following public health advice, such as physical distancing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381454">Through Health Canada's substance use and addictions program, we are providing funding for 11 projects to provide a safer supply of pharmaceutical-grade medications for people with opioid use disorder in British Columbia, Ontario and New Brunswick. This includes five multi-year pilot projects and six shorter-term initiatives, funded in response to the risk posed by the worsening toxic illegal drug supply as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These innovative projects will be independently evaluated and this assessment will contribute to building the evidence base to support the scaling up of effective models.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381455">In August, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> reached out to the provincial and territorial ministers of health and regulatory colleges to encourage action at all levels to better provide people who used drugs with a full spectrum of options for receiving care from practitioners. This includes increasing access to safer pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to the contaminated illegal drug supply for people at risk of overdose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381456">We also talked to public health workers in the provinces and municipalities about the unique challenges that we were facing in trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, while also protecting homeless Canadians.

              <ParaText id="6381592">Madam Chair, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of ensuring access to quality health care. Now more than ever, Canadians deserve to have a strong health care system that meets their needs. This includes the full range of health services such as home and community care services, as well as support for mental health and addiction issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381593">Canadians are proud of their universal, publicly funded health care system, but as our population ages and rates of chronic disease rise, they also expect all governments to work together to strengthen health care so that our people can continue to access the care they need, whether at home, in health care facilities or in hospitals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381594">That is why in 2017 our government committed to providing $11 billion over 10 years to the provinces and territories to help them improve access to home and community care, mental health care and addiction services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381595">We provided federal leadership on a common agenda for change through a common statement of principles for shared health priorities, which was signed by the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381596">As part of the bilateral agreements with each province and territory, federal investments help support the creation of initiatives or the development of existing projects in priority areas tied to home care and community care and mental health and addictions services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381597">Thanks to our efforts, the Canadian public receives more professional services and better coordinated and integrated care in home care settings. Care providers and patients have better access to the technologies and digital infrastructure for obtaining home and community care. People taking care of a loved one at home have better support. A greater number of Canadians have better access to palliative care and end of life care at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381598">This also means that children and youth have better access to school programming on the prevention, detection and early treatment of mental health problems. There are more mental health and addictions services in the community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381599">Canadians have easier access to crisis intervention services and multidisciplinary professional mental health services. We have better access to integrated, culturally adapted mental health interventions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381600">We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on Canadians' mental health. Canadians are dealing with stress and anxiety, which has highlighted the need for more mental health supports. The results of a study conducted by Mental Health Research Canada in April 2020 revealed that anxiety levels have quadrupled and that depression levels have doubled since the start of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381601">Furthermore, overdose rates had started to decrease in 2019, but the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the risks and harms associated with substance use and overdoses. In response, our government took swift action to meet the immediate needs of Canadians and to shoulder some of the burden for the provinces and territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381602">On April 15, we launched Wellness Together Canada, which gives all Canadians access to a wide variety of free mental health and drug addiction supports. This service is available 24-7 online, on the phone or via text message. More than 600,000 Canadians have accessed the various support options on the site, which include self-directed programs; peer support; and confidential sessions with social workers, psychologists and other professionals. In addition, there are specific resources and text messaging services for more vulnerable groups, such as youth and front-line workers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381603">I remain deeply troubled by the devastating effects that the opioid overdose crisis continues to have on people, families and communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381604">Since the start of the pandemic, we have reduced regulatory obstacles and increased federal investments. For example, in July 2020, the Government of Canada committed to providing $500 million to address immediate needs and shortcomings in the support and protection of people with mental health problems, substance abuse issues and homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381605">In 2020, we also announced an additional $32 million over five years to support 26 projects under Health Canada's substance use and addictions program. These projects will be implemented across the country and meet a variety of needs for harm reduction and treatment including $10 million to support 13 front-line community harm reduction projects; $16 million to support five projects to increase access to pharmaceutical-grade medications, also known as safe supply; and $6 million to support eight projects to find approaches to the problematic use of methamphetamine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381606">We also listened to Canadians from communities across the country who asked us to allow them to redirect their existing funds to support immediate COVID-19-related needs. That allowed us to fund six additional projects to provide access to safer, pharmaceutical-grade drugs, as an alternative to the supply of illegal toxic drugs, to people suffering from severe disorders related to problematic opioid use. We will continue to listen to Canadians and service providers in communities across Canada and work with our provincial and territorial partners and community services to respond to the crisis and support those who are among the most vulnerable during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381607">The pandemic has also revealed that it is essential we find new and better ways to provide care that take full advantage of technology and innovation. In March, when the pandemic hit, the provinces and territories quickly put in place temporary billing codes and new digital tools to ensure that Canadians could continue to receive the care they needed virtually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381608">To help the provinces and territories expedite their work, our government committed to providing $150 million this year for new initiatives to ensure that Canadians can access the services they need using secure text messaging, video conferencing and other tools. In addition, Canada Health Infoway will receive up to $50 million to develop pan-Canadian standards and support provincial and territorial efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381609">In addition, our government is working with our health care partners to implement a palliative care action plan. Measures included in the action plan will focus on information sharing, virtual health care, advance care planning and caring communities in order to reduce isolation and improve palliative care provided at home and in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381610">Our government is also investing $750 million over six to eight months to help control and prevent infections among vulnerable people receiving long-term care, home care and palliative care. At the end of the day, we want to ensure that all Canadians have access to the health care they need when they need it. This is a fundamental principle of health care in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381611">Now more than ever, the Government of Canada remains firmly committed to ensuring that Canadians have a public health care system based on the values of equality, justice and solidarity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381614">Madam Chair, the special access program, the SAP, gives doctors access to non-marketed drugs to treat patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable or are unavailable in Canada. Although emergency access is exceptional and although access to unapproved therapy is optimal in the context of a clinical trial, the SAP can provide limited access to therapies that have been approved in other jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381615">This program is an important way to help Canadians manage their health under exceptional circumstances. To protect patients from the potential risks associated with taking non-marketed drugs, Health Canada has mandatory reporting requirements for doctors accessing the program. They are required to report the outcomes of the treatment sought, including any adverse reactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381616">Concerns have been expressed about the SAP's administrative burden and the application process for potentially life-saving therapies. That includes concerns about the information required and the decision-making process, as well as the fact that there is no guarantee the requested drug will be made available and the perception that Health Canada questions doctors' judgment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381617">Can the minister explain how changes to the Food and Drug Regulations, which came into force on October 14, 2020, will help facilitate timely access to treatments doctors request to treat their patients under exceptional medical circumstances?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381618">Madam Chair, my thanks to my colleague for her very passionate speech. I have had the opportunity to work closely with her. I know how much she cares about the most vulnerable citizens of our communities. In her past work, she spent a lot of time working with the John Howard and Elizabeth Fry societies and folks who were trying to get their lives back in order after oftentimes very difficult circumstances. I thank the member very much for her work and her passion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381619">The question, however, relates to new SAP regulations and how the changes to the food and drug regulations related to the special access program help facilitate access. Facilitating access includes timely access to drugs by easing the burden for health practitioners by removing reporting requirements for treatments previously approved by SAP, approved without restrictions on the European or U.S. market, or previously approved in Canada, and the drug identification number was not cancelled for safety reasons; allowing for the shipment of treatments to a community pharmacy, which will be more convenient for patients, especially those who do not live close to their physician or hospital; and allowing advance importation and storage of drugs, known as pre-positioning, to facilitate quicker access to treatments requested through the SAP when urgent delivery is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381620">Also, we have made a number of operational changes so that we can support regulatory changes and improve client services under SAP. This includes additional supports for practitioners treating patients who are in urgent, life-threatening or end-of-life situations due to an emergency, critical or terminal illness, and a number of other situations.</ParaText>

They might help increase capacity, but they were not intended to produce more Canadian-made vaccines. Perhaps I misunderstood what was said about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381647">At the start of the pandemic eight months ago, the government decided to negotiate contracts to purchase vaccines from various pharmaceutical companies. There were many risks to be managed, and it certainly had to assess the possibility of immediately investing in Canada's vaccine production capacity. At that time, the government did not go with that option, and it chose to sign contracts instead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381648">I would like to know why the government did not decide to immediately increase production capacity eight months ago, so that now, eight or ten months later, we could produce the vaccines ourselves without depending on contracts with foreign pharmaceutical companies.</ParaText>

The tragedy of deaths in long-term care homes is something Canadians will never forget. In fact, 85% of the deaths in the first wave occurred in long-term care homes and we are seeing the same pattern with the deaths occurring now. Clearly more has to be done in all provinces and territories by all jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381664">The member opposite is right: There are staffing issues. In Quebec, 328 Red Cross staff are still in long-term care homes assisting the province to provide quality care to seniors so we do not see those kinds of horror stories again this time around. However, we have supported, through the safe restart agreement, $740 million to provinces and territories to strengthen infection and prevention control. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381665">I look forward to those conversations, quite frankly, and I am certain they will include the ways the federal government can support the provinces and territories to deliver better care for long-term care residents, no matter which province they live in.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381674">Madam Chair, I know the first line that my scriptwriter has put here echoes everybody's sentiment: I am pleased to be here today. We are having an important discussion tonight, and my portion of it will reflect something that is critically important. It is the process that goes on all the time outside of a pandemic, but is never more important than during a pandemic. We are here to discuss the regulatory modernization and the achievements relating to facilitating access to much-needed health products for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381675">Health Canada has played in the past, and will continue to play, a key role in protecting the health and safety of Canadians, and 2020 has been a really challenging year in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381676">Our government's top priority has been to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, we have focused on implementing innovative and agile regulatory measures to help prioritize and expedite the regulatory review of drugs and medical devices, including critical COVID-19 health products. We have had to do this without compromising Canada's high standards for safety, efficacy and quality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381677">There are obviously some pushes every now and again for politicians to set the agenda as to when such-and-such is going to happen or when so-and-so is going to be available. However, politicians should not be making those decisions. We should leave them to the experts and the people whose task it is to keep us all safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381678">Our efforts to modernize regulatory pathways did not begin as a response to the global pandemic. We have been at this for a while. In fact, for several years, Health Canada has mobilized on many fronts to improve access to the products that Canadians need for taking care of their health and the health of their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381679">Since 2017, Health Canada has been working on the regulatory review of the drugs and devices initiative to improve access to needed health products for Canadians. This has included strengthening the way the department collaborates with other regulators on the scientific review of drugs and medical devices. It has allowed Canadians faster access to many therapies, and so far this has been done in the areas of cancer, blindness, pediatrics, depression, opioid addiction, which is a major issue in British Columbia, and HIV home testing. Many more products are now coming to Canada as a result of these actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381680">Health Canada has improved its scientific capacity to review more affordable generic medicines and has also created accelerated pathways to provide earlier access to promising new drugs for patients. This is what we are seeing demonstrated today. For example, Health Canada has approved three novel cell-based gene therapy products, including one for the treatment of pediatric cancer patients. There is also a new IV formulation for five difficult-to-treat bacterial infections and another treatment for vision loss due to inherited retinal conditions. In other words, there are Canadians who gain faster access to therapies that directly help, thanks to these regulatory efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381681">Additionally, Health Canada launched an ambitious regulatory innovation agenda, and as part of these reviews, stakeholders made it clear that regulatory agility was key to economic growth and innovation. The pandemic has reinforced the need, of course, for the regulatory agility and flexibility that we need for getting health product oversight and a principled focus of the agenda's initiatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381682">Health Canada has also launched additional temporary emergency measures to help companies bring urgently needed health products and medical supplies for COVID-19 into our market. The measures include solutions intended to broaden access to clinical trials, expedite the regulatory review of health products and support enhanced management of product shortages. They have provided an opportunity to pilot many of the improvements planned as part of the agenda. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381683">As a result of these measures, Health Canada has approved 4,000 hand sanitizers, 495 medical devices, two drug treatments and 46 testing devices, and it has done all of this since March. The department has also received three vaccine submissions, with more expected in the near future. This has made a tremendous impact on Canada's leading response to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381684">Canadians and health care workers can count on Health Canada to ensure that their communities have access to the products they need to stay safe from the risks of COVID-19. Moving forward, Health Canada will build on the administrative and regulatory agility that has been put in place in response to COVID-19 to further support industry in providing timely access to much-needed health products. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6381685">Medical devices are playing a critical role in the public health response to COVID-19. Many Canadians also rely on these products to maintain and improve their health and well-being. Health Canada is continuing important work for the medical devices action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381686"> Health Canada has already accomplished a great deal under this plan. For example, in December 2019, Health Canada became the first regulator worldwide to bring into force regulations that required hospitals to report all serious adverse drug reactions and medical device incidents. This will be particularly useful in the pandemic, because we will be able to identify any safety issues Health Canada will need to take action on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381687">Finally, Health Canada established a new scientific advisory committee on health products for women. The committee was created to provide Health Canada with timely patient-centred scientific and clinical advice on current and emerging issues regarding women's health and the regulation of medical devices and drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381688">More important, however, is the rapid regulatory response, which has been key to supporting access to health products during the pandemic. Health Canada has introduced several innovative measures to maximize regulatory agility while maintaining protections for health and safety. The amount of work that has occurred on the regulatory side over the past few months is incredible. It is truly a historic response. For instance, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has signed five interim orders with respect to health products related to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381689"> An interim order is one of the fastest mechanisms available to the federal government to help make health products available to address larger scale public health emergencies. These include expedited pathways for clinical trials and access to drugs and medical devices. These new pathways have been successful in bringing COVID therapies faster to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381690"> Due to the high impact of illness from COVID-19, Health Canada and other highly regarded international regulators are prioritizing and expediting the review of all submissions for COVID-19 treatments. Health Canada is working with all our international partners to share information, to discuss the scientific evidence we are gathering and to ensure Canada's approach is aligned globally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381691">While we are working hard to give Canadians access to COVID-19 drugs, personal protective equipment and medical devices as fast as possible, we will not compromise Canada's safety, efficacy and quality standards. The agile response needed for the pandemic is rooted in the innovation and vision for a modern regulatory review of drugs and devices. We are proud of our accomplishments to date, our regulatory leadership and the ability to respond to an unprecedented health crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381692">I now have some questions for the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381693">It is clear that successive and robust border measures, including quarantine and travel restrictions, have had an impact on reducing travel-related COVID-19 infections in Canada. I would like to add that, from the British Columbia perspective, an analysis of where our initial infections came from surprised many people because they thought airliners coming over from Asia brought the virus with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381694">In fact, the vast majority of initial infections in British Columbia came from eastern Canada, and they got into eastern Canada as a result of people coming back from spring break. A lot of those people said to close the border, but I would not like to try to keep any of my buddies out of the country if they were coming back from their spring break. We actually had an obligation to let them back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381695">Despite the fact that essential workers are allowed to enter the country, the social and economic impact of travel restrictions has put a strain on Canadians and our economy. Considering certain U.S. states have lower rates of infection than others, from a border perspective, and to reduce the impact of border restrictions on Canadians, what would it take for Canada to allow selective re-entry from certain U.S. states?</ParaText>

It is a testimony to Canadian integrity that our regulators are seen worldwide as leaders in this field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381697">In response to borders, the member is right. Since the pandemic, we have taken successively stronger measures at the borders, first, going from screening from affected countries, and then later to actually restricting entry for non-essential travellers and foreign nationals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381698">Obviously Canadians always have the right to come home, as the member has pointed out. Even for Canadians returning home, we have additional measures, including mandatory quarantines for 14 days. We even have quarantine facilities for people who are coming into Canada who are either ill or unable to quarantine safely, to ensure that we can catch any importations of illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381699">A lot has happened on the border. As the member points out, some Canadians are frustrated, on the other side, about the border measures and how it either restricts travel or it restricts reunification with friends and extended family.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381702">Madam Chair, yes, we noted with interest the rapid test pilot in Alberta and despite what we have heard quite often about how rapid testing could really be a game-changer in controlling the spread of the virus, the rapid testing in Alberta has not necessarily produced that result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381703">Studies have indicated that the quick identification of positive cases through testing does allow for the isolation of those who are sick and timely contact tracing to limit the spread of COVID-19. Recently we have seen an increase in the global use of these rapid point-of-care tests to enable diagnosis and screening. Furthermore, these kinds of tests can also help reduce the strain on the public health system. That said, they do have their limitations and, in fact, dangers. We have seen the United States withdraw from rapid testing because in many cases they are not used properly and the results they get are highly inaccurate in some cases.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381705">Madam Chair, the member understands that the use of rapid tests is obviously an asset to jurisdictions but it does require careful guidance and utilization to make sure that the tests are used in a way that can actually add to the benefit of containing COVID-19. That is why not only have we been procuring rapid tests and rapidly, no pun intended, deploying them across the country to provinces and territories, but we also worked with provinces and territories to release, through the special advisory committee, updated screening and testing guidance so that we could actually understand how best to use which test for which purpose and in which setting. Again, all with the effort to contain COVID-19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381706">On the distribution side, we have distributed over 4.6 million rapid tests to provinces and territories to date. In Ontario it is over two million. In Quebec it is over 1.2 million, and in B.C. it is 354,000. Some provinces and territories are using these in novel ways. For example, I understand in Nova Scotia they have been deployed for use in bars and restaurants in certain pilot project settings, to understand the transmission in those settings. Other provinces are beginning to deploy them in long-term care facilities where there is a need for very quick turnaround and understanding for people who are symptomatic of whether or not they are COVID-positive, but some provinces and territories have not deployed their tests yet.

We know that COVID-19 can spread while people are asymptomatic. That is why testing has to be a component of a strategy to contain COVID-19, using contact tracing and isolation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381753">Madam Chair, earlier this year, about 360 international farm workers, who were working in greenhouses in Leamington, Ontario, were put in solitary confinement after being required to quarantine in hotel rooms. They had no contact with anyone for 14 days, and 12 of the workers were found to be asymptomatic. The owners of the greenhouse had to shut their greenhouse down, resulting in the loss of 7.8 million pounds of vegetables. It was shut down the same day the cucumber harvest was supposed to start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381754">For workers, while they are in Canada, their co-workers are like their family. They live together, and then they were put in solitary confinement, away from their Canadian families. For the workers, being barred from in-person human contact was inhumane and it took a toll on their mental health. This was like COVID prison for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381755">For many farmers, their farm workers return year after year to work with them. Some of them even go and visit their workers in their home countries. The relationship between farmers and their workers is like a family. In fact, earlier in the part of this forced confinement, the farmers were providing three square meals a day to each of the workers until they were banned from doing so. Then the Red Cross came in and offered them so-called meals of chips and pop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381756">In my family business of farming, my family has brought international seasonal workers here, just like Juan, Tyrone and others who were confined. Given that this happened earlier this year, it is understandable that Juan, Tyrone and several other seasonal farm workers like them may be reluctant to come back to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381757">Finally, shutting down a farm or a greenhouse shuts down food production and puts Canadian food security at risk. Of the 575 greenhouse workers tested at that particular greenhouse in Leamington, 199 came back with positive tests, but none of them were hospitalized and most of them were asymptomatic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381758">What steps are the minister and her cabinet colleagues taking to ensure Canadian producers and workers like Juan and Tyrone will not have a repeat of what happened this year with farm workers coming to Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381759">Madam Chair, I worked extensively on the Windsor-Essex outbreak with public health leaders, political leaders, members of Parliament and with the farming community and ensured that we all had one thing first and foremost, which was the protection of lives. It was tragic to see young farm workers die so far away from their homes. More had to be done. In fact, we provided support to farmers for the quarantine time. We ensured that farmers had the necessary financial resources to complete that quarantine for incoming workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381760">When it became clear that crowded housing conditions were accelerating the spread, along with interaction with other workers who were COVID-positive, and these workers were yet again becoming infected, we did send in the Red Cross to help support a humanitarian response to a growing crisis. Not only was this a risk to the farm workers, but it was a risk to the entire community of Windsor-Essex. It saw its cases climb exponentially and with a great degree of alarm. In fact, working together, we were able to put out that outbreak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381761"> I think we have all learned a lot about how we can better protect the lives and health of farm workers, who are so far away from home, and the people who live near them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6381785">Let me start by saying that obviously the wrench that has been thrown into our financial predictions, both in terms of health care and for all ministries of the government, has been COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381786">The opposition has been very vocal in criticizing our government for delays: being slow to do things, to recognize asymptomatic transmission, to close the borders, to advocate the use of masks and rapid testing and, most recently, to distribute vaccines to the people who need them. I think these accusations are unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381787">No one in the world predicted this pandemic, and certainly no one in the world was prepared for this pandemic. As of late, we have all become armchair epidemiologists, and for all those armchair epidemiologists out there, let me fill them in a bit in terms of the history of infectious disease. We are on chapter 12 of a very long book on infectious disease. Certainly infectious disease in the past has a long history. Infectious disease in the past was exceedingly important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381788">For example, in 541, there was the plague of Justinian. At its height, that epidemic killed more than 5,000 people per day in Constantinople.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381789">In the 1300s, the Black Death or the plague killed between 30% and 60% of the European population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381790">In 1812 it was typhus. When Napoleon retreated from Moscow, typhus killed more people than the Russian army did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381791">In the 18th and 19th centuries, the white plague, tuberculosis, killed an estimated one-third of the English population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381792">Of course in 1918, Spanish influenza, which was a particularly virulent strain of influenza, affected an estimated 50% of the population at the time and resulted in 80 million to 100 million deaths, which was 3% to 5% of the world's population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381793">Of note, as with COVID, infectious disease disproportionately affects the poorest people in our society. Tuberculosis and typhoid at one time were epidemics in wealthy countries in the northern hemisphere, but now have become rare in those countries. However, they remain as problems in many developing countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381794">Generally, as a result of the industrial revolution and increased prosperity in developing countries, infectious diseases have been a lot less of a concern in the northern hemisphere and northern countries; however, they remain endemic in many Third World countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381795">As a result of the industrial revolution and the increased prosperity in northern, more affluent societies, we have developed the belief that pandemics will no longer affect us, which has certainly proved wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381796">Before SARS and before COVID, there was, I would point out, HIV/AIDS, which was a pandemic, albeit a very slow-moving one, that affected multiple countries around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381797">It was SARS that really woke up the world to the threat of infectious disease, both in terms of morbidity and mortality, but also in terms of their effects on the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381798">In 2005, in response to SARS, the World Health Organization approved and passed the international health regulations, or IHRs, that gave the WHO the authority to advise countries, including Canada, on what measures to take to limit the spread of infectious diseases among countries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6381799">What has happened in recent years goes a long way in explaining why not just Canada, but the whole world reacted as it did to COVID, and why there was the slowness in reaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381800">Let me start off by giving a brief history of recent infectious diseases in the world. H5N1 was in 1997 in Hong Kong. There was a concern it would become a pandemic, but did not. H7N7 was in the Netherlands, which was another influenza outbreak. Again, there was a concern it would become a pandemic and it did not. H9N2 was in Hong Kong and it mostly affected children. There was a concern it was going to become a pandemic and it did not. H7N9 was the same thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381801">In 2009 to 2010, there was H1N1. There was an outbreak and it did go global, but WHO was heavily criticized for having overreacted and having been too quick to hit the panic button. In 2013, MERS was another coronavirus. There was a concern it would become a pandemic, but it did not. There were over 50 outbreaks of Ebola in Africa. Again, a highly infectious disease with a very high rate of mortality that really exceeds COVID-19. Again, a concern it would become a pandemic and never did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381802">This is really important to remember. There were numerous outbreaks of infectious disease where there was a genuine concern they would become pandemics. They never did. WHO was criticized for overreacting, being too fast to hit the panic button.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381803">When COVID came along in December 2019, people were a little hesitant to react. That is for a reason. There were all these other outbreaks of diseases that never went anywhere. WHO was heavily criticized for overreacting in the past with something that did not turn out to be a major concern. That, in part, explains its reaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6381804">As it turns out, they were wrong. We were wrong, they were wrong and everyone was wrong. It certainly explains the mentality and the reason for both our Public Health Agency and for our Ministry of Health being hesitant to react.
