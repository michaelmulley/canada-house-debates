              <ParaText id="6740524"> Nel was a breast cancer survivor and, as she put it, a person living with diabetes. For almost 40 years, Nel met diabetes head on and became one of Canada's strongest advocates for diabetics. Whether talking to people on the streets or participating in international Team Diabetes marathons, Nel continuously worked to raise the awareness of diabetes. Nel was a volunteer extraordinaire and will be remembered for how much she cared for people and for her community.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6740547">Unfortunately, it is not to celebrate significant milestones like in the past, such as record-breaking visitor numbers or another new award. Instead, we celebrate the spirit this great industry has to survive and persist, despite the great challenges that the pandemic and the lackluster government response have placed upon it. Tourism was one of the first hit by the pandemic and will likely be the last to recover, but when it does, I know it will be better than ever, showcasing Canada's breathtaking sights and great attractions. Prior to the pandemic, it was one of the fastest-growing industries, making up 2% of Canada's GDP and one of every 11 jobs, and I know that post-recovery those numbers will only continue to grow.</ParaText>

There are intergenerational sensibilities that this history carries. Canada, too, once added to their plight, when on the eve of World War II, 907 Jewish refugees aboard the MS <I>St. Louis</I> were refused entry into Canada. Later, 254 would face death and the atrocities of Nazi concentration camps. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740551">Lately, our country has seen a spike of hate and intimidation against Jewish communities. There is no place in Canada for vandalism of synagogues, violence or threats against people just because of their race or religion. No one should have to live in fear because of their cultural identity. “Never again” means standing against anti-Semitism whenever it rears its ugly head, starting in our own backyard, right here in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6740552">Mr. Speaker, in Canada, women veterans who are unhoused are invisible. A report from Canada in 2015 noted that veteran women experience much higher rates of homelessness. Women who served our country deserve much better than this. One of the biggest gaps is the lack of investment in Canadian-specific research. The voices of these veterans must be heard, and the support should better reflect their needs. One woman veteran said she never thought she would be living in a van.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740553">We look at what is happening to the women in our military today. We look at the fact that this government still supports the gold-digger clause, sexist legislation from the early 1900s that was created to protect old male veterans from predatory young women who were marrying them for their pensions. Now, this results in spouses, largely women, who have married veterans over 60, living with them well over 20 years, not receiving a penny when their loved one passes. </ParaText>

The months-long inquiry looked into allegations of fraud related to Liberal-friendly advertising firms being paid millions of dollars for little to no work. In the face of constant attacks from the Liberal government and its supporters, Justice Gomery stood unwavering and resolved to seek the truth in the name of the public interest. His findings of clear political involvement, secrecy, subversion and insufficient oversight demonstrated that the government had betrayed Canadians' trust. Because of his commitment to truth and justice, Canadians now expect the bar of accountability and ethics in government to be held to a high standard.</ParaText>

While this report contains helpful information and shares the realities faced by many, the recommendations at times were overly prescriptive and wordy. That said, it was a good process, and I would like to thank all of my parliamentary colleagues for their participation in this report.</ParaText>

Bill C-6 is the government's conversion therapy legislation that is currently before the House. Petitioners support the objective of the bill, which is to ban conversion therapy. However, they note that the bill poorly defines the practice of conversion therapy. The definition, as written, is so broad that it could apply to many conversations that simply have nothing to do with conversion therapy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6740873">Mr. Speaker, Fisheries and Oceans Canada understands how important the Pacific prawn fishery is to British Columbia’s economy and culture. That is why we are making sure that tubbing can continue and harvesters will be able to sell their catch to Canadians to enjoy. This season, we have confirmed our support for an interim protocol that was developed by the industry, which will help prawn harvesters ensure that their catch continues to be sustainable and will be available for sale. We will continue to a take a cautious approach to fisheries management, one that prioritizes the conservation and sustainability of the stocks while also supporting this important industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740874">In response to (a), the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, DFO, has not banned the flash-freezing or tubbing of prawns at sea. The practice of flash-freezing prawns whole and individually finger-packed at sea has occurred since the 1990s and remains the predominant product type since the mid-1990s. Tubbing prawn tails at sea in frozen sea water has occurred for a number of years but has not been prevalent, and has grown in recent years. The industry estimates that about 10% of the total prawn catch is tubbed. Prawns are also delivered live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740875">In response to (b), the requirement to pack prawns in a way such that the size can readily be determined is not a new or recent decision, nor has DFO recently changed its interpretation of the regulations. Any person who catches a fish while commercial fishing must have it packaged in a way that allows for the species, number, weight, and size to be readily determined. This regulation has been in place since 1993 and is essential for DFO to verify harvesters’ catches and properly manage fisheries, particularly in situations where size restrictions apply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740876">DFO has been actively working with the commercial prawn industry on market traceability for packaging and labelling of prawns frozen at sea. Among the objectives of this project is to limit access to markets for illegal products, and for packaging to be done in a manner that will meet all existing federal and provincial regulations. Over the course of this work, DFO identified our concerns about packaging spot prawn tails in frozen sea water, also known as “tubbing”, in late January 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740877">DFO’s concerns with onboard packaging of prawn tails in tubs of frozen sea water are that this packaging does not enable the determination of the size of prawn tails in the tub, which is a requirement outlined in subsection 36(2) of the fishery general regulations, 1993. Size limits are an important component in managing conservation and the sustainability of the spot prawn. It is important that all packaging at sea allows for size limits to be readily determined by a fishery officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740878">In response to (c), over the course of the market traceability work, DFO Pacific region fisheries management and conservation and protection staff identified DFO’s concerns to industry representatives about packaging spot prawn tails in frozen sea water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740879">In response to (d), as described in earlier responses, there was no decision made to ban freezing or tubbing of prawns at sea. The minister and her office were made aware of industry concerns about the prospect that tubbing may not meet regulatory requirements through industry outreach to her office and briefings from DFO officials in early March.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740880">In response to (e), size limits were first introduced in 1988 based on scientific research published in 1985. Size limits are an important component in managing the sustainability of the prawn fishery and are based also on recommendations from industry. A size limit allows prawns to grow, reach sexual maturity, and mate prior to being harvested. It also allows for increased growth prior to harvest. Harvesting prawns at a larger size increases the weight and value, price paid per pound, improving economic return.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740881">In response to (f), an analysis was conducted in 1985 estimating the increased dollar value and price to harvest prawns at a larger age and size. Size limits are an important component in managing the sustainability of the prawn fishery and are based also on recommendations from industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740882">In response to (g), as described in earlier responses, there was no decision made to ban freezing or tubbing of prawns at sea. As a result of DFO’s collaboration with industry, the Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association, which represents commercial prawn fishery licence-holders, has developed a protocol that provides guidance to harvesters on steps they can take this year to help them comply with the regulations that require them to keep their catch readily available for inspection by fishery officers, including catch frozen in tubs. DFO supports its use as an interim approach for 2021. The commercial fishery is scheduled to open May 14, 2021 and usually closes by end of June. DFO will continue to engage with industry over the coming year to determine a longer-term solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740883">In response to (h), DFO officials have been meeting with commercial prawn fishery representatives on this issue over the past several months. DFO recently convened a working group with fishing industry representatives to explore options for addressing the tubbing issue for 2021. The protocol is a result of this work. DFO will continue to work with industry to transition to packaging practices or other measures that will allow size limits to be readily determined over the coming year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740884">In response to (i), no negative impacts are expected for export or domestic markets. DFO does not anticipate higher expenses for fishermen or higher prices for Canadian consumers. DFO is aware of the importance of tubbing to some harvesters. A protocol has been developed to provide guidance to harvesters on steps they can take this year to help them comply with the regulations that require them to keep their catch readily available for inspection by fishery officers, including catch frozen in tubs. DFO conservation and protection will apply discretion in its enforcement approach for the 2021 fishing season, recognizing the effort industry has made to establish the protocol and the challenges industry faces this year, while the development of different packaging practices or other measures is completed over the coming year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6740887">With regard to part b), the ozone-depleting substances and halocarbon alternatives regulations implement Canada’s obligations under the Montreal Protocol by controlling the import, export and manufacturing of ozone-depleting substances, ODS, and climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs. The regulations will help reduce Canada’s annual consumption of HFCs by 85% by 2036, making a significant contribution in Canada’s fight against climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740888">The objective of the essential purpose permit provision is to provide flexibility for a limited period of time in recognition of the challenges that some companies may face in producing or acquiring compliant products by the deadlines established in the regulations. Any person subject to the regulations may apply for an essential purpose permit at any time. In order to get such a permit, the criteria set out in section 66 of the regulations must be met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740889">The essential purpose permits provide a temporary exemption to the prohibitions. They can have a maximum duration of 36 months, and they include reporting and other obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740890">Essential purpose permit applications are evaluated by carefully assessing the sector and the specific circumstances of the applicant against the criteria in section 66 of the regulations. In assessing applications, ECCC expects applicants to demonstrate that efforts are being made to find an alternative, including mitigation measures to reduce the environmental impact if possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740891">These essential purpose permits do not affect Canada’s ability to meet its international obligations under the protocol or to achieve its HFC phase-down target. In fact, in both 2019 and 2020, Canada exceeded its HFC reduction obligations. The Montreal Protocol controls the production, import and export of bulk HFCs. The protocol does not cover the manufacture or importation of products that contain HFCs. The essential purpose permits only apply to regulated products that are not included in the Montreal Protocol. As such, these product prohibitions go beyond Canada’s obligations established under the protocol.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6740893">Mr. Speaker, section 2.1 of former Bill C-32, an act to enact the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights and to amend certain acts, S.C. 2015, c. 13, provides that a committee of Parliament is to be designated or established for the purpose of reviewing the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights, CVBR. The launch of this review is, therefore, the independent responsibility of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740894">The Government of Canada appreciates the importance of reviewing and assessing existing legal, policy and programmatic responses to increase access to justice for victims of crime in Canada. In support of these efforts, the government appreciates the contributions of the federal ombudsman for victims of crime, including the recommendations included in its November 2020 progress report. These recommendations are currently being reviewed by federal officials, including at the Department of Justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740895">The Department of Justice recognizes that implementing the CVBR takes many forms and involves all levels of government and agencies that have responsibility in the criminal justice system. Since the CVBR came into force, federal, provincial and territorial governments have been advancing legislative, programmatic and policy initiatives to support its full implementation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740896">A wide range of activities and investments have been made through the federal victims strategy in support of the CVBR, such as training for criminal justice professionals on victims’ rights, public legal education and awareness raising for victims to inform them about the rights they have in the criminal justice system, increasing access to critical services and supports for victims and survivors and their families, and increasing access to the information they need to help them through the criminal and corrections systems. At the same time, funding for new tools, such as testimonial aids and restitution programs, has been made available to help victims participate meaningfully and safely in the criminal justice system and have their voice heard. A formal evaluation of the federal victims strategy and the impact of those investments is forthcoming.</ParaText>

I know how hard they work to provide for their families; protect their health and provide a better education for their kids, which we know are the keys to a better future; and to take care of their aging parents and grandparents.

              <ParaText id="6740924">That is why, when a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic such as COVID-19 shook the very foundations of our health care, and social and economic systems, our government stepped up and ensured that we would do everything we could to help protect Canadians. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> often says, we have Canadians' backs, meaning we will be there for Canadians every step of the way to support them and to help them weather this storm. The actions we have taken have helped Canadians stay safe and buffer the worst economic impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740925">This third wave has hit hard, with further public health restrictions and regional lockdowns leading to many Canadians facing unemployment or reduced hours this last couple of months. As we work to finish the fight against COVID-19, we will continue to support Canadians through programs such as the Canada recovery benefit, a more flexible EI program and the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which continue to be lifelines for so many Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740926">That is why we announced through budget 2021 that we will be maintaining flexible access to EI benefits for another year until the fall of 2022, fulfilling our campaign promise to extend EI sickness benefits from 15 to 26 weeks, extending the Canada recovery benefit by an additional 12 weeks until September 25, and expanding the Canada workers benefit to support low-wage workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740927">These are historic investments that address the most pressing issues exacerbated by COVID-19, which are to put people first, create jobs, grow the middle class, set businesses back on a track, and ensure a healthier, greener and more prosperous Canada.</ParaText>

It is a recovery plan for jobs, growth and resilience, the Government of Canada’s plan to finish the fight against COVID-19 and ensure a robust economic recovery that brings all Canadians along. The COVID-19 recession is the steepest and fastest economic contraction since the Great Depression. It has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, young people, women, and racialized Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740929">The pandemic has laid bare long-standing inequities in our economy. Budget 2021 is an inclusive plan that takes action to break down barriers to full economic participation for all Canadians. It would establish a $15 federal minimum wage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740930">For businesses, it has been a two-speed recession, with some finding ways to prosper and grow, but many businesses, especially small businesses, fighting to survive. Budget 2021 is a plan to bridge Canadians and Canadian businesses through the crisis and toward a robust recovery.

This 2021 budget proposes to provide $90 million to Employment and Social Development Canada, a government department responsible for social programs, to launch the age well at home initiative. This initiative would assist community-based organizations to provide practical support that helps low-income and otherwise vulnerable seniors to age in place, such as matching seniors with volunteers who can help them with meal preparation, home maintenance, daily errands, yardwork and transportation. This initiative would also target regional and national projects to help expand services that have already demonstrated results helping seniors stay in their homes. Funding would be provided over a three-year period starting in 2021-22. I am pleased to say that many non-profits and charitable organizations working with seniors across the country stand to benefit from this measure.</ParaText>

This budget would provide $3 billion over five years to Health Canada to support provinces and territories, ensuring standards for long-term care are applied and permanent changes are made; and, $41.3 million over six years and $7.7 million ongoing, starting in 2021-22, for Statistics Canada to improve data infrastructure and data collection on supportive care, primary care and pharmaceuticals.</ParaText>

Many seniors are living longer and they are relying on monthly benefits to afford retirement. These funds would be delivered in two steps. The 2021 budget would support seniors by providing a one-time payment this August of $500 and increase regular OAS payments for pensioners 75 and over by 10% on an ongoing basis as of July next year. This would increase the benefits for approximately 3.3 million seniors, providing additional benefits of $766 for full pensioners in the first year and indexed to inflation going forward. This would give seniors more financial security later in life, particularly at the time when they face increased care expenses. In total, the two measures represent $12 billion over five years for our seniors in additional financial support, beginning in 2021-22; and at least $3 billion per year ongoing, to be delivered by Employment and Social Development Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6740957">Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the Liberal government's budget implementation bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740958">It took almost two years for the Liberals to get around to presenting a budget, the longest period in Canadian history without a budget. For decades there had never been a gap of more than two years between budgets, until the current Liberal government. Despite COVID-19, all other G7 countries produced budgets last year, so too did our provinces and territories, yet for two years, Canadians expecting the Liberal government to lay out its priorities in an open and transparent fashion were left waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740959">The fact we are here today debating this bill is positive, but presenting a budget is one of the bare minimums expected of any government. Now that we have this budget, it has been something of a letdown. One would think that after two years with time to prepare the Liberals would knock it out of the park, but that is not what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740960">As I listened to debate on this bill and reviewed the contents in my role on the Standing Committee on Finance, I have been struck more by what is absent from the budget than what is included. I noticed the Liberals are doing the bare minimum of what is expected of them and then expecting accolades in return.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740961">As Canadians continue to face challenges as a result of COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed upon governments in response to COVID-19, Conservatives have been clear that those struggling need support. When the government forces someone to close down their business or prevents customers from shopping at their store, the government has a duty to support them through that situation. When the government forces people to stay home and prevents them from earning an income, the government has a duty to support them through that situation. Everyone in this House gets that and I think they all support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740962">Measures to that effect included in Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> are important, but they are the bare minimum the government can do for Canadians during this time. A serious budget would do something more. It would include a road map to help Canadians move beyond this endless cycle of restrictions and lockdowns. It would include a data-driven plan to safely reopen the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740963">As we have heard time and time again from witnesses at the finance committee, a plan would help many small businesses, many hard-hit industries, looking for some certainty to help them plan for the future. Workers employed in sectors like tourism and hospitality, the aviation industry or our border communities depend on cross-border travel. They deserve to know when their lives will return to normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740964">As Canadian families struggle to recover from a tough year, budget 2021 offers little encouragement. Instead, the Liberals are asking Canadians to accept the bare minimum. Besides a safe plan for reopening, this budget was a missed opportunity to address the need to support Canada's economic recovery and growth. After living with COVID-19 in Canada for more than a year, how can the government still be spinning its tires?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740965">Upon reviewing this budget, many economists have lamented the troubling reality that this budget is more about short-term benefit than positioning our economy for long-term success. I know the Liberals like to look good, but I would argue that doing good, not just looking good, is what Canadians want and expect from their government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740966">For example, former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney said, “What we're seeing in some other jurisdictions is that the focus is more squarely on the growth.” Another former Bank of Canada governor, David Dodge, noted “a lack of growth-focused initiatives in the budget.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740967">Robert Asselin, a former top economic adviser to the Liberal government described the new spending as “unfocused and unimaginative.” He also wrote, “it was clear for some time that the government’s decision to spend more than $100 billion in so-called short-term stimulus was a political solution in search of an economic problem.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740968">Former clerk of the Privy Council, Kevin Lynch, said the budget “misses an urgent opportunity to rebuild our longer-term growth post-pandemic.” He also said, “Despite the extraordinary emphasis on stimulus, there is little focus and few measures to rebuild Canada's longer-term growth.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740969">These comments, taken together, point to a real problem. If one's house is on fire, one wants and expects the fire department to come to one's aid. When it is the only house on fire, the resources are best directed toward that home. However, if the fire department showed up and sprayed a little water on that home then moved on to spray some water on the neighbour's place then turned around and sprayed the houses across the street, one would seriously question their approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6740970">It matters where the flow of water is directed, yet this seems to be the approach taken with this budget. There is no focus, no intentionality in terms of directing resources where they are actually required so Canada can move beyond the economic harms inflicted throughout COVID and thrive once again. Without doing the hard work of determining where federal tax dollars can be most impactful, the Liberals are asking Canadians to accept their bare minimum effort.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6740987">The Association of Day Care Operators of Ontario has highlighted the consequences of this proposal: uncertainty for families, limited access, job losses at existing day cares and the closure of many women-owned small businesses.</ParaText>

They need a budget that does not just spend for the sake of spending, but rather makes targeted investments that will generate tangible results for all Canadians. They need a budget that sets real goals for ensuring Canada's long-term fiscal sustainability, a budget that supports families in making best choices for themselves. Sadly, this bare minimum budget does not cut it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741007">Madam Speaker, I was thinking today about how I should approach the budget implementation bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741008">I have a particular fondness for the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation>. I like it when he says we are trying to pick a fight. I was wondering how to interpret that, and I was reminded of a name my father used to call me when I was a teenager.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741009">My father was the king of neologisms. He was a guy who could invent concepts and words. When I was young, he would tell me that I was “contrarious”. I do not know if that came from the word “contrary” or “contrarian”, but he told me that “contrarious” means someone who scratches their backside when their head is itchy. That is just his turn of phrase. I do not mean to be offensive. That, according to my father, is what it means to be “contrarious”. I think that someone who is “contrarious” is someone who goes against what makes sense. It is true that in my teenage years, I frequently did things that did not make sense and defied my father out of stubbornness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741010"> Now when I hear this government telling us that we are trying to pick a fight, I often think that they are using the same contrarian rhetoric. I am not saying that the government has an itchy head and is scratching the wrong spot. That is not what I am saying. I am simply saying that perhaps some of the government's actions are counterproductive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741011">In my view, there are four aspects of Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> that clearly demonstrate that the government's actions are counterproductive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741012">The first aspect is old age security. My office has never received as many complaints as it has about the government's proposal to give $500 to people aged 75 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741013">While my father used to use the analogy that our heads are itchy but we are scratching our backsides, I would say that seniors are fired up, and that is the truth. I have never received so many complaints, both online and by email. This is unfair. It creates two classes of seniors. We have made our position clear, but we did not even need to, since that is how it looks on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741014">The seniors receiving the payment are unhappy. Seniors aged 75 and over who have a spouse under 75 who will not be receiving it are unhappy, and they are vocal about it. Some of the emails I received even got quite abusive, blaming me as if it had been my decision. I am getting this type of criticism. It is understandable in the context of the pandemic that there are tensions and people who are unhappy. As we know, seniors were the ones who were overlooked during the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741015">The Bloc Québécois made a proposal, masterfully presented by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>, that I think was rational and reasonable. Why not increase old age security by $110 a month and increase the guaranteed income supplement by $70 for a couple and $50 for a single person? To me, this is a desirable and reasonable position. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741016">I said earlier that the government is acting unreasonably. In my opinion, it is not picking a fight to say that. I am saying that, having listened to the people on the ground, the seniors in my riding, I believe that a desirable and reasonable position would be to increase old age security by $110 and the guaranteed income supplement by $50 or by $70 for a couple. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741017">Health transfers are another aspect of Bill C-30 that I find unreasonable. To me, this perfectly encapsulates what is not working in federalism. I clearly remember two instances of what we call Canadian-style neo-liberalism that took place in the Canadian federation after the 1995 referendum, in 1996-97 and 1997-98. The government cut transfer payments by $2 billion each fiscal year. It totally dismantled Quebec's health system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741018">There was a report, the Séguin report, which was issued not by a sovereignist, but by a federalist. This report demonstrated what we call the fiscal imbalance. No one ever came out and said that it was conjured up and contrived by the interests of people who had a different political opinion from the sovereignists. No one ever came out and said that, but I think it is a proven fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741019">Then there was a slightly better agreement on health transfers with the Conservatives, thanks to a bit of a push from our party, it must be said.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741020">Then, under the Harper government, we were back to meagre health care funding. Year after year, the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that if nothing changed with respect to health transfers, provincial deficits would grow while the federal government ended up swimming in surpluses. That is according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, not me. It is in the 2013 report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741021">What is in Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>? Certainly not the 35% the provinces want. The government is signalling that transfers will come with strings attached. That is what we saw for senior care. That seems to be the government's intention. I think this indicates something unreasonable that nobody wants to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741022">Another fairly important aspect of Bill C-30 that made me raise my eyebrows when I read it is the extension of various programs, such as the wage subsidy. My thought was that, if the government were interested in fixing a mistake, it could simply change the wage subsidy to make it off-limits to political parties, but there is nothing about that in Bill C-30.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741023">It is no secret that we will likely be in campaign mode soon. Some political parties will be campaigning using money from the wage subsidy. We are still waiting for our Conservative friends to pay back this money. They at least admitted that it may not have been ethical and may not have been the right thing to do. The Liberal Party and our colleagues in the NDP, however, seem quite comfortable with their decision to claim the wage subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741024">The government could propose a worthwhile amendment to fix that. At the very least, an amendment would send the message that members of the House of Commons do not create programs that benefit them personally. That is all I will say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741025">The infamous green recovery is another thing that I think is unreasonable and counterproductive. I will never understand what the government is trying to do with this green recovery. There is virtually no mention of it in Bill C-30. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741026">The only information have we gotten about the green recovery so far is an announcement about the electrification of transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741027">Allow me to back up a little. I am sure this figure is shocking, but the government is talking about a $17.6-billion investment in the green recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741028">Do members know how much the Trans Mountain pipeline cost? It cost $17.1 billion, and that was just one project. Overall, the pipeline costs as much as the green recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741029">That is an image that really hits home, for anyone who is serious about the environment. When it comes to the green recovery, what we have been hearing about is the electrification of transportation. That bothers me a bit because Ontario is going to make off with most of the money associated with that, yet it is the only province that is no longer offering a rebate for purchasing an electric vehicle. That is ironic, but let us leave that aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741030">The other thing that really bothers me is that the government announced its intention to get into hydrogen production. There are three types of hydrogen. In committee, the government told us that it would prefer to develop the hydrogen market without making a distinction. Anyone who is familiar with the energy sector would tell us that the worst idea out there right now is grey hydrogen. There is no way that making hydrogen out of oil and gas is environmentally friendly. It is anything but.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741031">Lastly, I want to talk about the forestry industry. There is nothing in Bill C-30 about the much-talked-about $55 million that was announced for the investments in forest industry transformation program, or IFIT. Why is it not in there? I do not know. Fifty-five million dollars is nothing. It is peanuts compared to the support that was announced for the oil and gas industry. There is nothing about that in Bill C-30.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741032">I do not have much time left, but, in closing, I want to tell my friend, the leader of the government, that I am not trying to pick a fight, but when my head is itchy, I scratch it, and when my backside is itchy, I scratch that. It is important to be consistent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741061">Madam Speaker, the budget makes some positive steps toward addressing the affordable housing and homelessness crisis in Canada. Unfortunately, it is not enough to make up for decades of neglect by the federal government. Housing is a human right, recognized in international law and affirmed in the national housing strategy. Much more needs to be done to ensure that right is respected. Weak regulations have allowed our housing market to be used by the global ultrawealthy for tax evasion and money laundering. These activities have driven up the cost of housing to unsustainable levels and it continues to climb. Where does this end?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741062">We should be looking at regulations to protect Canada's residential real estate market. Many countries have regulations that restrict foreign buyers. I have heard both Conservatives and Liberals talk about how much they love foreign direct investment. When people earning median incomes can no longer afford to own or rent a home without spending 50% or more of their income, is foreign direct investment in housing benefiting Canadians? Housing prices in Canada have gone up an average of 30% in the past year. We have barely begun to see the fallout of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741063">The investment in Canada's nature legacy is a very welcome addition, especially the funding directed to indigenous protected and conserved areas, or IPCAs. Reconnecting indigenous people back to their traditional lands is key to reconciliation. A sixth mass extinction is happening right now. Species are disappearing at a rapid rate, and we are losing important and endangered ecosystems around the planet. The endangered big tree old-growth ecosystems on Vancouver Island are a perfect example of where the funding from Canada’s nature legacy should be spent. Indigenous protected and conserved areas would put land under the control and authority of local first nations. This ensures long-term economic development built on harvesting second-growth forests and creating value-added forest products, while preserving old growth for eco-tourism and traditional practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741064">Low-income seniors in my riding have been asking for additional pandemic relief and for a permanent increase in the old age security. The budget promises that old age security will increase in 2022, a year from now, but only for seniors over the age of 75. This is creating two classes of seniors: those 75 and up and those under 75. This is going to force more seniors to continue working in jobs that young people could be filling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741065">It is positive that the government is moving toward national standards for long-term care, but bolder action needs to be taken. The pandemic has exposed glaring deficiencies in some provinces that allowed for the warehousing of seniors in for-profit homes. Serious action should be taken against private for-profit long-term care homes that used pandemic relief funding to give executives and shareholders a bonus instead of fixing deficiencies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741066">The government has made a good start with additional support for students during the pandemic, with interest relief and an increase in student grants, but it is time to take bold action to bring Canada fully into the knowledge-based economy. It is time to follow the lead of northern European countries and make post-secondary education in this country tuition-free. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741067">The Green Party has long been calling for improvements to our health care system, with an increase of health transfers and a system that recognizes provincial demographic differences. There is an incremental move toward universal pharmacare, but we need bolder steps to ensure Canadians have access to the medicine they need. We have been calling for universal pharmacare, universal dental care, universal mental health services, wellness care and a patient-centred focus on health and well-being to keep people out of the sickness care system, because we know that all of these things will save money in the long run and keep Canadians healthier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741068">Small businesses are going to have a more difficult recovery than large multinational companies that have been able to ride out the storm with big box stores and online sales. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of the economy. They hire the vast majority of private sector workers. Special consideration needs to be given to ensure that the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses across this country are able to recover. The wage subsidy ends in September. Many businesses in my riding need help well beyond September. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741069">This is Tourism Week. The budget commitments to the tourism industry are not enough. Tourism's contribution to the economy is underestimated. Tourism employs more people than oil and gas in Canada, and $500 million is not adequate to meet the needs of tourism operators across the country, especially for those who will not be in full operation again until at least 2022. </ParaText>

When the pandemic hit, they and their team worked hard to get Canadians home and cancel bookings. They have struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic. They have lost well-trained, loyal employees and are concerned about the end of the wage subsidy. They will lose support before they are expecting to be able to restart their business in a serious way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741071">The plan to lower the Canada recovery benefit from the current $500 a week to $300 a week by July needs to be re-examined. Workers are still struggling and may not be able to find enough work to compensate for that reduction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741072">The pandemic has demonstrated the need to improve our social safety net with a guaranteed livable income. We are going to see additional shocks to our economy with automation, artificial intelligence and climate change. A guaranteed livable income can help ensure that no one falls through the cracks as we navigate these new realities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741073">How will we pay for all these things? During the peak of the pandemic, more than 5.5 million Canadian workers lost their jobs or were working half of their normal hours. More than half of Canadians are within $200 of not being able to cover their monthly bills. At the same time, Canada's 48 richest billionaires increased their wealth by $78 billion and now have almost a quarter of a trillion dollars among them. We now know that some large corporations used taxpayer-funded relief programs to pay their shareholders and executives huge bonuses. That is disgusting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741074">Canada needs an increase in the progressive tax rate at the higher income brackets. We also need a wealth tax and an inheritance tax for the ultrawealthy. It is time to close tax loopholes that allow them to offshore their wealth and avoid paying taxes. It is time to tax the Internet giants that extract billions from our economy. Big banks and credit card companies have been raking in profits through increased user fees and interest rates they charge to consumers and businesses, and payday lenders are trapping low-income people into predatory loans with terms designed to keep them in endless cycles of debt. This is unacceptable. How have we let income inequality reach this point? All of these things could have been dealt with in this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741075">Over and over again during this debate, I have heard the Conservatives call on the government to spend less. They caution about deficits and increasing debt. I agree with them in at least one area: We need to end all taxpayer handouts to the fossil fuel industry. Real climate action requires that we cut all funding to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, cut all subsidies to fracking companies and put them on notice that their climate-destroying practice will be banned within the year, and make the costs of industrial cleanup a non-dischargeable debt so we can stop subsidizing the cleanup of abandoned wells. The fossil fuel industry is a sunset industry. It is time to stop propping it up and invest those billions in a just transition to a renewable energy economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741076">While there are a number of things that are positive in this budget, it falls short of dealing with the challenges of our time. We are in a climate emergency and we have growing inequality. Canada can and must do better for people and the planet. I will continue to work toward that goal.</ParaText>

He was talking about stranded assets. The eastern part of Canada could be significantly stranded if Line 5 gets shut down, and that is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741093">He was talking about oil and gas being a sunset industry. That may be true, but that sunset is not likely to happen until several hundred years from now. We are still seeing an increase in demand for oil production around the world. Even if one believes all the projections, that increase in demand, not a reduction in demand, will continue for the next 30 years at a minimum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741094">What better place to get those hydrocarbons from than Canada? We have some of the most ethically produced oil on the face of the planet, with some of the lowest-carbon-intensity oil, right here in Canada. Never mind the fact that we are importing hydrocarbons from around the world to continue to supply Canada. That alone seems to be ridiculous, in my opinion. We are an energy-rich country. We have endless amounts of natural resources in this country, yet we rely on other countries to supply our energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741095">In the case of Line 5, we are relying on another country to keep the licensing going for that particular pipeline. As far as I know, right now that pipeline is operating illegally. The most recent Line 5 news is that the easement through the State of Michigan has been revoked, but the pipeline continues to operate. We are hanging in limbo as we go forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741096">I am speaking to Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which is the budget implementation act. It has been fascinating to listen to all of the discussion around this particular budget. We hear repeatedly from folks about the subsidization of the oil and gas industry. I was just discussing with one of the Bloc members how the government subsidizes oil and gas, but does not subsidize the forestry industry. I have not seen any direct subsidies to the oil and gas industry, with the exception of buying a pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741097">The Trans Mountain pipeline was being built by private industry. Due to the actions of the government, the pipeline was no longer to be built. The government subsequently bought that project. If that is what the Bloc member meant by subsidizing oil and gas, I get it. I do not think we need to be publicly funding pipelines either. Pipelines have been built successfully in this country for generations by private industry, and I would assume that would continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741098">The Bloc member was commenting about the forestry industry in Quebec. In Northern Alberta, the forestry industry is a big contributor to jobs and the economy. Oil and gas are a shiny spot in our economy, but Alberta's economy is diversified. Where I come from, we do the three Fs: forestry, farming and fracking. Those are the big job creators in my area, and they are basically what support all of the population in the area. I am always interested in the challenges we see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741099">One aspect of this budget implementation act is the removal of interest on the apprenticeship loans that have been given out. I think that is a noble cause. I am the product of one of the apprenticeship programs in Alberta. I was one of the first to go through the rapid apprenticeship program when it was introduced back in 2003. I got my automotive ticket from Northern Alberta Institute of Technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741100">The apprenticeship programs we have developed in Alberta are world-renowned and recognized. There is also the good work of NAIT, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. I went through there in classes full of apprentices.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741101">Many of my friends have been apprentices. I got my journeyman's ticket back in 2007, so I know about the life of an apprentice. The beauty of apprenticeship programs is that people typically get to work while they are getting their training. Believe me, all of the apprentices I know are tradesmen. They are proud of what they do. They work with their hands. They would all very much appreciate having jobs right now, rather than having the interest on their loans waived. While I appreciate that in this particular bill, I do not see a lot in this bill that will get these people back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741102">I call Line 5 the magic pipeline because it has changed the Liberal rhetoric on pipelines dramatically. The Liberals are now starting to sound like Conservatives: Pipelines are the safest way to move petroleum products. If we did not have this pipeline there would be 8,000 rail cars and 15,000 tanker trucks on the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741103">There is one way to get all of these apprentices back to work, and that is to start building some of the pipeline projects that had been proposed and were ready to be built back in 2015. One, in particular, runs parallel to Line 5 and is called energy east. That pipeline was ready to be built back in 2015 when I was first elected. The Liberals kiboshed that project, but we do not see anything. We do not see a repeal of Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>: the “no more pipelines” bill. That would have been something they could have put in the budget to promote the development of our natural resources, promote jobs and promote private industry spending its own capital to get folks back to work and get us back to the lifestyle we were used to before COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741104">This seems like a prime opportunity to get us all back to work. It would ensure that we would have apprentices across the country making paycheques and being able to pay the interest on their student loans by going back to work. They could be raising their families, making money and doing all of the things that they do. I do not see a lot of those kinds of initiatives in this particular bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741105">One thing that I saw in the budget was around the home renovation tax credit. I was hopeful we would get some details on it in this bill, but they are not evident. It was an initiative that the Conservatives undertook during the last great recession. We rapidly passed the home renovation tax credit, which allowed people to update their windows, insulation and other kinds of things. It could also be thought of as a green initiative. It was in the budget. We were talking about a particular $5,000 tax credit on a $40,000 loan. We do not see details of that in this particular bill, so I am disappointed about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741106">Lastly, I want to talk a little about equalization. This bill touches on equalization, and on what is called the federal-provincial transfer act. One of the things that Albertans have been requesting for a number of years is the removal of the cap on that financial stabilization program. It is currently capped at $60. The Liberals have moved that cap to $166. That is a movement in the right direction, but there still is no logic as to why there is a cap on the equalization stabilization program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741107">Why is there a cap? If a province is suffering under duress and having less revenue than it had in the past, the stabilization program is there to maintain funding for programs while we go through a dip in revenue. Nobody can explain the logic for why there is a cap on that. We see that the government has acknowledged that maybe the cap is too low and it is going to raise the cap to $166, but the Liberals do not provide us with any logic whatsoever as to why there needs to be a cap on that program. If government revenues in a particular province are suffering in a major depression, the stabilization program is supposed to balance that out and ease the pain of that. Why would it have a cap on it? There has been no logic whatsoever provided for that. I am also quite frustrated by that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741120">Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to the Liberal budget and raise concerns on several fronts. When I was elected in 2019, and in the years prior during the first mandate of the Liberal government, we saw deficit after deficit with no clear plan for balancing the budget. The grand plan for the budget to balance itself was failing. Now here we are a year and a half since the last election, and the $20-billion deficits we were concerned about then seem like a drop in the bucket compared with the enormous budget we are debating today. For years, the Conservatives warned the government about spending the cupboards bare when times were good, and now we are facing the repercussions of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741121">The pandemic was unavoidable. No matter which party was in power, there would have been large costs associated with COVID. However, this brings to mind the famous saying that life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we respond to the challenges thrown our way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741122">I will take some of my time today to reflect on the failures of the Liberal government and the ways it was too slow to act, which cost Canadians dearly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741123">First, it was early January 2020 when the Conservatives raised concerns about COVID-19 and called upon the government to take action at our borders. It was not until late March, when numerous COVID cases had already entered Canada, that the government took action. This delay in action would cost us big time. As opposed to a proactive response to the pandemic, what we had was a reactive one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741124">Second, the government failed to implement and utilize widespread rapid testing. Widespread rapid testing would have allowed more businesses to stay open, as there could have been better testing and tracing. Instead, for the past year, businesses have been teetering on the edge between not being allowed to stay open at all or being allowed to open under strict rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741125">Canadians are now 15 months into this climate of uncertainty, with the Liberals only making things worse by not providing them with a clear plan to reopen our economy. I was deeply disappointed when the government voted against our opposition day motion to provide Canadians with certainty and establish a clear plan to reopen our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741126">I believe $354 billion is a staggering number. That is how much debt the government has added to Canada's debt load for 2020-21 alone, bringing the total amount of debt added by the Liberals since 2015 greater than that of all other governments combined. Let us break that number down. The largest purchase that most Canadians will make in their lives is the purchase of a home. Currently, with rapid inflation in the housing market, the average Canadian home is worth $716,000. This means the homes Canadians spend the better part of their lives paying for could be purchased nearly 500,000 times over in this year's federal budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741127">When I think about the deficits we are accumulating, what concerns me most is the fiscal mess we are leaving behind for future generations to deal with. The interest on our debt is forecast to be $30 billion per year by 2026, and that is with low interest rates. To put that in perspective, this budget commits $30 billion to child care over the next five years. In the same time frame, we could spend that amount five times over simply just servicing our debt. Therefore, it is extremely important that we return to a balanced budget as soon as possible, so that we are not further increasing what we are paying in interest payments and can instead put money toward helping Canadians get ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741128">A few months ago, I stood in the House and spoke to Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> and to my concerns with raising our debt ceiling to $1.8 trillion, an increase of $663 billion. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252933" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>, compared this to asking for a line of credit from taxpayers but not saying where that money will be spent. Now, in this budget, we finally have some answers as to where this money will be spent and where it will not be.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741129">Alberta's oil and gas industry has once again been forgotten by the Liberals. In the 725 pages of this budget, the words “oil and gas” are mentioned only once in relation to the wage subsidy. While the wage subsidy has helped the sector through COVID, it is not what this sector needs to prosper, and the temporary wage subsidy does not address the root issue of red tape and government roadblocks. When our oil and gas industry does well, Canada does well, and as the most ethical oil producer in the world, we should be creating more economic opportunities for oil and gas by getting pipelines built and supporting our world-class technology and our emerging industry in carbon sequestration. This budget leaves behind the oil and gas industry and all the economic prosperity that comes along with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741130">The Conservatives know that spending is required to recover our economy. We had a strong recovery plan after the 2008 financial crisis. We made targeted investments, got Canada's finances back on track and returned to a balanced budget by 2015. However, make no mistake: This budget is not the same thing. It does nothing to secure long-term prosperity for Canadians. Instead, it presents a plan for a reimagined Canadian economy, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put it. It is a plan that dabbles in risky economic ideas such as abandoning our oil and gas and natural resource industries, leaving our economy in a precarious position. This is not stimulus spending focused on creating jobs, but spending on the Liberals' partisan priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741131">When I talk about targeted support being needed, an area that comes to mind where this budget has a shortfall is tourism. COVID-19 has decimated the tourism industry in Canada, with many businesses on the brink, permanently closing or coming out of the pandemic with large debts. There is no doubt that the programs currently in place are helpful. However, I worry the $500 million allocated to tourism recovery is not enough, especially when the Liberals continuously fail to provide us with a plan to reopen our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741132">Canada's tourism industry has a similar GDP to that of the oil and gas industry, and while at least tourism, unlike oil and gas, is getting some money through this budget, $500 million is not adequate when I look at all the tourism businesses from coast to coast that need support. It is extremely important that we fully recover the tourism industry, especially in communities that rely on the industry as a significant part of their economy, such as the municipality of Jasper in my riding. Approximately 48% of the municipality's GDP was related to the tourism industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741133">Another area of the budget that stuck out to me was the unfair and unjustified old age security increase for seniors over 75, as there was nothing for seniors aged 65 to 75, who have also been struggling throughout the pandemic. Statistics Canada recently reported that inflation has surpassed the Bank of Canada's 2% target and is now reaching 3.4%. Policies like the Liberal carbon tax and money printing have driven this inflation, and old age security payments must reflect that. Perhaps when we get to questions after my speech, a Liberal member can explain why they believe 65- to 75-year-olds are immune to inflation. It is far too often that seniors are emailing my office and saying they feel let down by the government's failures to support programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741134">To conclude my remarks today, I would like to reiterate that I cannot support this budget because of the staggering deficit and the fact that the new spending in this budget is ideologically driven and completely abandons our oil and gas industry. This long-anticipated budget is a major letdown for western Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741135">I look forward to questions from my colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741154">In previous budget debates and examining the Liberal deficits in the range of $18 billion to $20 billion, I had stated how these deficits created a public debt amounting to about $500 for every living Canadian. That is $500 for every person in Canada, whether they have the means to repay it or not. For the fewer than 50% of Canadians who are in the workforce and able to repay debt, their share was exponentially more than $500 per person on average. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741155">Throughout this pandemic crisis, I have supported emergency spending, which was necessary to help individuals and small businesses get through the layoffs and business shutdowns caused by the restrictions required to prevent the spread of the virus. Members from all parties, and indeed all Canadians, have invested varying levels of trust in this government to spend where necessary to protect Canadians, to end the pandemic and to help Canadians and employers who required assistance along the way. In more than one way, Canadians had no choice but to trust this government to spend money and deliver a pandemic response. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741156">How has this government treated the trust of those who depend on it? Well, scandals have emerged and proven the self-evident truths that this government has reportedly failed to focus and deliver the investments required to secure the future of all Canadians. Crisis spending was and is clearly still required, but without a plan, spending without controls never delivers the outcomes that are needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741157">One outcome of the government's spending that we can all bank on is the additional $343 billion in national debt that the government has already added, which works out to $9,270 for every Canadian, whether they are able to repay it or not. That means, once again, that those in the workforce who are potentially able to pay down debt have been handed another tax bill of $20,000 each by this government. What is worse is that the government still has no clear plan for getting Canadians back to work to start paying down the debt of the 2016 to 2020 deficits, and now this new added debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741158">I have reviewed the budget and searched for the priorities identified to me by the good people of North Okanagan—Shuswap; the priorities that I have consistently relayed to this government on behalf of my constituents. Unfortunately, in budget 2021, this government has failed to recognize some vitally important needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741159">Affordability is something weighing on the minds of many Canadians and, once again, this government has failed to recognize the reality in this budget. Seniors on fixed incomes see the cost of groceries and everyday living growing faster than their pensions. With no way of increasing their incomes, seniors are already worried that the future increases in taxes to pay for this government's spending will leave them with fewer dollars for daily living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741160"> Young families see the cost of their first home growing faster than their income, and they need a plan to make home ownership more affordable. As the inflation rate has hit 3.4%, the highest level in a decade, these young families can only fault this Liberal government, with its policies of flippantly printing and spending money, for their inability to keep up with rising costs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741161">On infrastructure, over the years I have advocated on behalf of municipalities and first nations in need of infrastructure programs to help grow their communities and secure the future of their residents and members. The one-time investment of $2.2 billion to address infrastructure priorities in municipalities and first nations communities through the federal gas tax fund is not the long-term commitment the communities are looking for. When major infrastructure projects often take years to implement, a one-time injection is somewhat like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise of a one-shot summer. There is no plan to follow through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741162">On investments in aquatic invasive species, AIS, I have heard from numerous conservation organizations, municipalities, first nations and regional districts that are all justly concerned about the persistent threat of aquatic invasive species to wildlife, ecologies and economies in the North Okanagan—Shuswap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741163">In 2019, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> directed the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">fisheries minister</Affiliation> to make new investments in the fight against invasive species. Nearly a year and a half later, British Columbians are still waiting for the government to finally provide some new resources to protect our waters from invasive species.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741164">Having served with the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">fisheries minister</Affiliation> for years on the fisheries committee, the minister knows that the introduction of Zebra and Quagga mussels to B.C. waters would devastate our ecosystem and local economies, yet she persists in withholding the new investment the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> mandated her to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741165">More needs to be done and Canadians deserve better. Throughout the pandemic, I have heard from hundreds of constituents doing their best to contend with the challenges they face. One common thread that I see in the input and requests I have received is that Canadians need a plan to help them secure their future, a long-term national recovery plan. Canadians want a plan that will secure their jobs. Businesses have been contacting me saying they are unable to fill shifts because of disincentives for people to go back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741166">That is why the Conservatives put forward a back-to-work bonus plan to help Canadians transition back to work, while gradually reducing the need for government benefits. Canadians want a plan that will secure accountability. Constituents have contacted me tired of the breaches of ethics by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his cabinet and caucus. That is why Conservatives adopted the policy put forward by one of my constituents to strengthen legislation around accountability and transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741167">Constituents want a plan that will secure mental health. We all know someone who has been impacted by mental illness and been unable to access the support they need. Canadians need a plan that recognizes mental health is health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741168">Canadians also want a plan that will secure the country. Early in the pandemic, we learned that Canada was not prepared and that stockpiles of PPE had been shipped to China by the government. Canadians need a plan that ensures we are prepared for the next threat to our security, whatever threat that may be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741169">Canadians want a plan that will secure our economy, rather than borrowing and printing more money and driving up inflation. Canadians need a plan that provides stimulus measures that are targeted and time limited to avoid creating a structural deficit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741170">These are the differences between the Liberal government's budget and the implementation act, and our Conservative plan to secure our future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741171">When I hear of seniors' drop-in organizations that have been forced to close because they spent their last dollars paying utility bills and got no help from the government to remain solvent so they could be there when restrictions are lifted again, I see a government that has failed its citizens. When I hear from businesses that could be growing except they cannot find workers to fill shifts, I see a government that has failed. When I hear from first nations, municipalities and community organizations that the government is not providing the protective measures mandated by the minister, I see a government that has failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741172">Canadians deserve better and I look forward to working with the good people of the North Okanagan—Shuswap in our pursuit of the plans and resources needed to secure the future and the future of all Canadians.</ParaText>

          <ParaText id="6741175">The House resumed from May 3 consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="10866280" Type="4">C-237, An Act to establish a national framework for diabetes</Document>, be read the third time and passed.</ParaText>

          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Desilets" id="11337495">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253114" Type="2">Mr. Luc Desilets (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741176">Mr. Speaker, we are here this evening to discuss Bill C-237, otherwise known as an act to establish a national framework for diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741177">The purpose of this legislation is to promote and improve access to diabetes prevention and treatment. It is sponsored by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253089" Type="2">Brampton South</Affiliation> and is going into the third stage, in other words, third reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741178"> To summarize Bill C-237, it seeks to explain what diabetes and prediabetes are; identify the training, education and guidance needs of health care and other professionals related to the prevention and treatment of diabetes; promote research and improve data collection in order to enhance the knowledge and information sharing required to conduct research; and ensure that the Canada Revenue Agency is administering the disability tax credit fairly so that it can help as many persons with diabetes as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741179">The legislation gives the government one year to develop the policy framework, and within five years the government must evaluate its effectiveness and revise it, of course, if necessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741180">It should be noted that since 2016 Health Canada's Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control has been managing the diabetes strategy. This plan is very general and contains more policy statements than meaningful measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741181">Key aspects are essentially the same as the previous plan. That is why countless organizations are calling for a national plan or framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741182">The Bloc Québécois is in favour of developing a national framework for diabetes. To oppose it in light of the medical catastrophe that this chronic disease represents would be just wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741183">However, it is imperative that this framework be developed with the demands of Quebec and the provinces in mind and, again, that the division of powers be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741184">In a way, health is a competitive jurisdiction since it involves some overlap between the provincial and federal governments. In the area of health, Quebec must have maximum authority and control. That is what we want and that is what we will have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741185">The federal government does have a role to play in prevention, and that includes working to stop the rampant obesity rates in this country. Obesity significantly increases a person's chance of becoming diabetic. Although Quebec is doing well compared to the other Canadian provinces and many major countries in the world, one in four Quebeckers is obese and will be obese in the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741186">Diabetes Canada, the most influential diabetes organization in Canada, does not operate in Quebec. Instead, Quebec is fortunate to have Diabetes Québec, which provides information and support to its members and contributes to research. In 1994, the organization even founded Entraide diabétique du Québec, a separate organization that collects donations to help people with diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741187">There are three main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. In all three types, the disease is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, which means that the person's glucose levels are too high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741188">Insulin abnormalities mean that sugar does not enter the body's cells to provide energy, but remains in the bloodstream anyway. This condition, which is lethal if left untreated, has a strong impact on susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, blindness and kidney failure, among others. Obviously, this type of disease can lead to limb amputations due to the factors listed previously.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741189">With 442 million adults affected worldwide, diabetes truly is a global scourge, and Quebec is not spared. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, one in 10 Quebeckers has diabetes or pre-diabetes. The financial burden of diabetes is naturally staggering. According to Quebec's public health department, we are talking about $3 billion a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741190">The good news is that almost 90% of type 2 diabetes cases can be prevented or even cured by adopting healthy lifestyle habits. This is why it is imperative to take preventive action by educating people about healthy lifestyle habits, including good nutrition and exercise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741191">However, we would be deluding ourselves if we thought that the ball is entirely in our court. The sugar lobbies are obviously working hard to slow down, dilute or nip in the bud any form of legislation that might seek to reduce refined sugars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741192">Legislating for a tax on products containing refined sugar, honest labelling or a restriction on the advertising of these products would prove to be a difficult but necessary task.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741193">Conversely, we must also point out that the diabetes epidemic is a boon for pharmaceutical companies. In 2016, global profits from sales of insulin reached almost $50 billion. It is extremely difficult to conduct an effective prevention campaign when going up against powerful pharmaceutical companies, which boast that they can help people with diabetes live a normal life, even though that may be stretching the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741194">While waiting to win this battle, it is vital that we continue and even redouble our efforts to provide adequate services. Medical research is making great strides, but it is not enough. We also know which communities are the most vulnerable to diabetes. In Quebec and Canada, it is first nations. The rate of diabetes in these communities is five times greater than that in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741195">To address this problem, Health Canada has invested approximately $50 million per year since 1989, mainly through the aboriginal diabetes initiative. Organizations are tasked with working with indigenous peoples to reduce health inequalities. At this time, much more still has to be done, and the federal government will have to invest far more than $50 million a year to reverse the current trend. That, however, is a debate for another day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741196">It was exactly 100 years ago in Ontario, in the magnificent country of Canada, that insulin was discovered by a team of medical researchers. For their work, Frederick Banting and John Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine two years later, in 1923.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741197">As a pioneer in diabetes research and its treatment, Canada must have a clear and ambitious national framework. Nevertheless, the Bloc Québécois's support is contingent on the federal government respecting input from the provinces and Quebec and on the division of powers, which is what the Bloc Québécois wants. We will vote in favour of the bill as is because it does meet all the necessary criteria so far. Bill <Document DbId="10866280" Type="4">C-237</Document> does not promise to eradicate the scourge of diabetes within the next few years, but it is a very acceptable solution even so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741198">Before I wrap up, I want to highlight the work of an organization in my riding, the Association du diabète Laval, Laurentides, which has been working tirelessly since 1984 to educate people about diabetes and share knowledge through presentations and workshops.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741199">I would like to take this opportunity to thank hospitals and clinics in my riding and the rest of Quebec for the work they do every day to fight diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741200">I applaud the medical professionals responsible for diagnosing and supporting patients with diabetes and improving their quality of life.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741205">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise to speak to this bill to establish a national framework for diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741206">Currently, more than six million Canadians are living with diabetes and the health and financial costs associated with it. Today, many Canadians living with diabetes are unable to afford the medications, devices and supplies they need. We also know there are even larger costs related to non-adherence that can lead to avoidable complications and sometimes even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741207">This is especially true for too many families that I represent in London—Fanshawe. I have heard from folks who struggle with being able to put food on the table and to keep up with the rising costs of housing and with the large and rising costs of medication. They are often faced with an impossible choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741208"> One person I spoke to talked about paying their bills every month, and called it creative financing: the bills they skip this month they pay the next month; what medications can they choose to stretch or which prescriptions must they leave unfilled. Sadly, these choices can lead to poor health outcomes and hardship. They also have to live with the choices that federal and provincial governments make that too often overlook them and cause them a lifetime of greater suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741209">I cannot imagine a family in Canada that has not been impacted by diabetes. Mine certainly has. My grandfather lived with diabetes, but he was fortunate to have a unionized job. He was a steelworker and his union ensured that he had benefits and drug coverage. However, for far too many Canadians, a well-paying job with benefits is not a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741210"> We have also seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic how the massive downturn in the economy has come with the shutdown of workplaces, and this can lead to many people losing those benefits and often at a time when they need them the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741211">The New Democrats believe the federal government must support the development and implementation of a new national diabetes strategy based on the Diabetes 360º framework that was developed in 2018 by Diabetes Canada and dozens of other stakeholder groups. The government should also facilitate the creation of type 1 diabetes and indigenous-specific strategic approaches, the latter to be led and owned by indigenous communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741212">The Government of Canada must support indigenous-led programs. Indigenous communities are asking for services and research, the prioritization of food sovereignty, access to culturally appropriate care and treatment options, traditional healers and medicines. They are also asking for any assistance to raise awareness about gestational diabetes and the increase in diabetes among young indigenous women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741213">In addition, the New Democrats believe that there is an urgent need for a universal public pharmacare plan that would ensure all Canadians living with diabetes would have access to the medications they need, when they need them. This must include coverage for diabetes devices and supplies such as test strips, syringes, insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors. There have been incredible technological advancements that help people living with diabetes monitor their insulin levels through apps on their cellphones, but these are expensive and out of reach for too many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741214">Canada has no formal national strategy to address diabetes, one of the most significant health care crises of our time according to Diabetes Canada. Although the World Health Organization recommends every country have a national diabetes strategy, Canada's previous strategy fizzled away in 2013, followed by a scathing report on its underperformance by the auditor general. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741215">Depending on where people live in Canada, what other private insurance they have and what their treatment protocol is for their diabetes, it can cost a patient out of pocket up to $15,000 a year to live with diabetes, and that is unacceptable. However, other provincial governments are providing leadership on this front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741216"> For example, the current B.C. NDP government expanded its pharmacare coverage for diabetics aged 25 and older to use insulin pumps instead of relying on daily injections to stabilize their condition. Under the former Nova Scotia NDP government, the province extended coverage for the cost of insulin pumps and supplies for eligible youth aged to 18, and supplies for people 19 to 25 with type 1 diabetes who used an insulin pump. Under the former NDP government in Manitoba, the province brought in a program to cover the cost of pumps for youth. These were all positive steps made by current and former NDP governments across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741217">I wish I could say that we are seeing similar positive steps in my home province of Ontario. Earlier this month, the Ontario Conservative government voted down NDP MPP Taras Natyshak's Bill 272 that called on the government to add continuous glucose monitoring and flash monitoring devices to Ontario's assistive devices program for Ontarians diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. This bill would have made life easier and more affordable, removing financial barriers to technology that would make it easier to manage diabetes and would remove the need for the frequent finger pricks. It is said that the provincial Conservative government could not have seen the merits in passing it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741218">There is an estimated one in three Ontarians living with diabetes or pre-diabetes, approximately 4.3 million people. People in Ontario and across Canada need to see a government that will support them and, of course, the principles outlined in the Canada Health Act, which are clear about universal health coverage. It is clear that we need a national framework to bring expanded coverage for Canadians, no matter the government, no matter the province and no matter the postal code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741219">Any national framework needs to be backed up with a national universal pharmacare plan. A recent report from the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions found that 57% of Canadians with diabetes reported failing to adhere to their prescribed therapies due to affordability issues related to medications, devices and supplies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741220">The Liberals say the right things when it comes to pharmacare, but when it comes time to act, they put the profits of big pharmaceutical and insurance companies ahead of what Canadian families need. The Liberals have been promising pharmacare for 23 years, but Canadians are still facing sky-high prescription costs that make it hard to make ends meet. Right now, millions of families cannot afford to take the medications they need because they have no drug coverage. The number of uninsured people forced to skip their medications is growing, and with the COVID-19 pandemic, most people work on contract or are self-employed or have jobs that do not come with health benefits or have no job at all. As well, too many seniors are putting their health at risk because they do not have that drug coverage and they cannot afford to pay out of pocket for their medications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741221">Bulk buying of pharmaceuticals undercuts inflated prescription costs set by private companies and would let us lower costs dramatically by negotiating prices as an entire country. We could save $4.2 billion and use that money to give better health coverage to all Canadians. A national framework for diabetes combined with a national universal pharmacare plan would have a direct impact on families across Canada and families in my riding of London—Fanshawe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741222">The lack of dedicated support or action to tackle the diabetes epidemic means that every 24 hours more than 20 Canadians die of diabetes-related complications, 14 have a lower limb amputated, 480 more are diagnosed with the disease, and the health care system spends $75 million treating patients with the disease. It does not have to be this way, but we need a government that has the political will and courage to get it done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741223">It would be a missed opportunity on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the discovery of insulin in Canada if we fail to ensure that every Canadian living with diabetes can afford access to insulin. Of course, as a proud Londoner, it would be a failed opportunity if I did not mention this anniversary as well. In 1921, Dr. Frederick Banting, Charles Best, James Collip and their supervisor, John Macleod discovered insulin. This discovery revolutionized the treatment of diabetes worldwide and remains among the most celebrated medical discoveries in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741224">Yet today, many Canadians living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are unable to afford the medications, devices and supplies they need. I cannot imagine this is the outcome that Banting, Best and Collip wanted or imagined when they were awarded the American patents for insulin, which they sold to the University of Toronto for $1 each.</ParaText>

It can be disheartening to see a government continue to be heavily lobbied by large pharmaceutical companies and, even more so, that it seems to listen. That is why New Democrats support the creation of a national framework for diabetes, and we will not stop fighting for a national universal pharmacare plan.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741229">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today to speak to this private member's bill, which has been brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253089" Type="2">Brampton South</Affiliation>. I want to congratulate her on taking her private member's opportunity to bring forward a bill or motion and put it to such a meaningful and important cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741230">I used to sit very close to the member for <Affiliation DbId="253089" Type="2">Brampton South</Affiliation> in the House, and I know her passion for health care and making sure that the most vulnerable in our communities, especially as related to health, are taken care of. In the last session of Parliament, on a number of occasions while sitting next to each other, she talked to me about the need for something to be done nationally on diabetes. In this Parliament's lottery, she was very lucky to have her spot near the top of the list and had an opportunity to do something. To see this bill brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253089" Type="2">Brampton South</Affiliation> is truly rewarding, because I now that she is doing something that she is extremely passionate about. Indeed, she has been a leader in bringing members from different parties in this House together to talk about diabetes and the strategy that the federal government should take. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741231">When we talk about a disease that affects over three million Canadians, I must admit that I was kind of surprised to learn that we did not already have a strategy of some form in place as it relates to making sure that we have a coordinated effort across the country in fighting diabetes. As indicated by a number of people in this House in the previous hour of debate on this bill, it is something that affects so many Canadians and their quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741232"> In many instances, diabetes is a preventable disease. Of the roughly 200,000 Canadians newly diagnosed with diabetes, approximately 90% is the preventable type 2. When we think of the growth in the aging Canadian population, the number of Canadians expected to live with diabetes obviously grows as well. Putting in measures to make sure that we have a national strategy as it relates to educating health care professionals on how to prevent and treat diabetes is critical, probably more important than at any time previously in fighting this particular disease, with the exception, of course, as mentioned by the previous speaker from the NDP, of the invention of insulin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741233">I am so glad to see so much support throughout the House from various parties, and it appears as if the bill might pass unanimously. It is telling of how this Parliament can come together and work together here in this place, but also show the desire to work with our counterparts at the provincial, territorial and municipal levels to make sure that all Canadians throughout Canada can have a meaningful framework in place so they are taken care of in the event they get diabetes and, in fact, to help prevent that from being the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741234">It is very rewarding and I am very proud to be part of a government that has brought forward many initiatives on health care throughout the various budgets that have been presented since 2015. I would note that, in budget 2021, there is $25 million over a five-year period, starting in 2021, specifically for Health Canada for additional investments in research on diabetes, specifically juvenile diabetes, surveillance and prevention, and to work towards developing a national framework on diabetes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741235">This private member's bill dovetails nicely with what this government is already in the course of doing in terms of making sure that we continue to advance the research, prevention and education around diabetes. Indeed, Bill <Document DbId="10866280" Type="4">C-237</Document> will be developed in consultation with provinces and territories, indigenous groups and other stakeholders to help support improved access to prevention and treatment and better health outcomes for all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741236">One of the various elements that have been brought forward is the $25 million over five years, which I mentioned, but in budget 2021 there is also a proposal for $10 million over five years for the Public Health Agency of Canada for a new diabetes challenge prize. Specifically, this initiative would help surface novel approaches to diabetes prevention and promote the development and testing of new interventions to reduce the risks associated with type 2 diabetes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741237">As has been illustrated by both the government approach and members of this House, including the member who brought forward this bill and members from other parties who have been speaking in favour of it, this is something this Parliament really does see as an opportunity to seize on this issue and to advance the objectives of Parliament and those health objectives for the benefit of all Canadians. I am very proud to be supporting this. Knowing we can have such a great impact on the lives of so many Canadians is something deeply meaningful to all members of this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741238">I will conclude with where I started, which is that I am very encouraged to see this member use her opportunity through this private member's bill to bring forward something that will have a meaningful, large impact on a number of Canadians throughout this country. Indeed, if the national strategy is developed in the right way and brought forward in a way that really helps prevent people from getting diabetes, the value of her impact will be immeasurable, because down the road many people may end up not getting type 2 diabetes in particular because of the prevention measures that would be put in place here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741239">This member knows a lot about this topic. As I indicated before, she was very passionate about it and spoke very passionately about it. I know that before coming into Parliament she was in the health profession specifically. I always like to see examples of people who come to this House with previous knowledge outside of government and its workings, people who have a specific passion, perhaps from a former profession, and bring it here and apply it to policy. What could be more rewarding than working in a profession and then bringing it to the seat of democracy for our nation and putting that knowledge into actual, practical use and turning it into legislation, as it appears this member will be doing through this bill, given the fact that all parties have indicated they are going to be supporting it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741240">I will not use up any more time, but I am very much looking forward to adopting this and having a vote on it at the end of this hour of debate, and moving on with this strategy so we can see the national framework be developed for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741241">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of the speakers tonight because I think they have brought so much warmth to this discussion. The fact is that diabetes, as all speakers have said, is something that is preventable in 90% of cases. I think this is a great time to all join together and talk about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741242">I am so glad it is you in the chair, Mr. Speaker, because I can share with you the types of phrases that are used in my house, or my mom and dad's house, every day. Any time I walk into my parents' house I hear, “Karen, your father's sugar is high. Ask your dad how many cookies he ate today. Your father's sugar was at 15 and he is miserable." This is all I hear: “Your father's sugar is high” and “Karen, are you watching your sugar?” These are my parents. They love me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741243">I am from a family where many of my elderly relatives have been challenged with diabetes. That is why I am so happy to speak on this bill today, Bill <Document DbId="10866280" Type="4">C-237</Document>, a national framework for diabetes act, which is focused on prevention and treatment. According to Diabetes Canada, there are 11 million Canadians living with diabetes or prediabetes. These are really important things, so we have to understand the three different types of diabetes there are and what we can do as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741244">I am going to start off with the least simple one, which is type 1 diabetes, and then I will talk about what many of us have discussed, which is type 2 diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741245">Type 1 is an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. The damage is permanent. If we look at who is going to have these issues, we recognize that type 1 diabetes mostly impacts people before the age of 35, though it can develop later on in life as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741246">It is one of those things that people are born with, or there is something determining that they will end up with type 1 diabetes, whether genetics or whatever it may be. There is no solution to what is causing these issues. These are things I think many families are very concerned with because having a child who has diabetes is life altering. This is something I look at as a mom. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741247">The research being done through our juvenile diabetes associations and all of those groups is really important because of the impact type 1 diabetes has, especially on our youth. I am sure everybody in this House has probably seen a young person on a field playing soccer, baseball, or whatever it may be, with a pump on their side. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741248">The first time I saw that was probably about 15 years ago. A young girl came to my house to visit with the kids and she had her own insulin pump. It is incredible to think of this very active child and of her parents knowing she is on the soccer field and there is a chance of her passing out or having issues at any time. This national strategy is important because it would help all families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741249">We understand this form of diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body is not able to create insulin, so we have to ensure we have the technology and the advancements to make sure that person has a whole life. I am talking about these young children. Earlier in my career, I had some people come in from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the JDRF. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741250">It was great when they came in because they were talking about some of these little pieces they were wearing on their hips that showed how many carbohydrates they had in their diet, what proteins and all of these things. Having a framework and funding is so important because this is a disease we can do more about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741251">Type 2 diabetes is something that we talk about most often, and 90% of diabetes cases are type 2. This has more to do with insulin resistance, where the insulin hormone is not used efficiently. That takes me back to first year university biology, when we talked about the impacts on the kidneys if the pancreas is not working, which can have a very negative effect on a person's life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741252">We will talk more about that because I think, when talking about type 2 diabetes, we can really pinpoint what we can do. There truly is a path to limit and reduce the number of people who are living with diabetes. There is prevention, and that is why I think this is a really important strategy as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741253">Gestational diabetes is an issue that pregnant women have when insulin-blocking hormones occur, and we see many women going through their last weeks of pregnancy with diabetes. In many cases, it goes away quickly and they will be fine, but there are some cases we have to be concerned with.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741254">Diabetes, as I indicated, has been an important part of my life. I think of my family members who have lived with it. I remember back in the mid-1970s when my grandmother came to live with us because she had to have her leg amputated due to diabetes. Of the common issues there are with diabetes, amputation seems to be very common, especially when we are talking about 45 years ago. It is incredible to see how things have changed in the last 45 years. We are not seeing as many amputations. We are seeing that proper care and maintenance that needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741255">With someone who has type 2 diabetes, we have to be worried about heart and stroke issues, nerve damage, and the eyes and retinopathy. There are many factors that we use to control and manage these things. That is why I think that with type 2 diabetes, we really need to look at a national strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741256">This plan would be very useful in seeing how can we have a national strategy that really takes some of the best practices from our provinces and territories. We can work together, ensure that the research is being done and see how we can assist by funding. We can assist the provinces and territories in recognizing that we are a partner here. We are not the main game holder, but we can enhance people's lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741257">In some of the key factors of managing and controlling, we need to look at nutrition and fitness, including meal planning, healthy eating, exercise and activity, and weight management. To drill down into this more specifically, I pulled out a report from 2012 done by the Government of Ontario focusing on some of the key recommendations. Many of the diabetes factors and many of the things we can move forward on are truly common sense things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741258">For instance, we can reduce obesity. We know that being overweight is a key factor to diabetes. What can we do? How can we ensure that somebody is going to increasing their physical fitness and activity? We know that with insulin, when someone is exercising, it is more controlled. Over those two or three hours of exercising, one's glucose tolerance actually starts to change with those activities. People should be aware of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741259">We know that overall the physical exercise someone does will give them better health, including for their heart. We need to make sure that we are maintaining healthy weights. That is something I will be very honest about. I am not sure what I would be at a healthy weight. We know that, especially women. We can look at stress as another factor that can lead to this. Right now people are sitting at home due to stress, due to COVID and doing different routines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741260">We know a lot of people have packed on what some people call the “COVID 15”, or the “frosh 15”, if one went to university back in the nineties. A lot of people have gained a lot of extra weight. What are some things that we can do to ensure people are going to be healthy again? We know that maintaining a healthy meal plan and making sure we are eating proper foods are other ways of doing so, by having a healthy diet. Another thing is not to smoke. We know that with diabetes, smoking is something that can cause great complications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741261">I heard my colleague from the Bloc indicate this also, and I am very proud, being from Elgin—Middlesex—London, that we have a statue honouring Sir Frederick Banting who, in 1923, along with John James Rickard Macleod, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. They codiscovered insulin. This is the type of great work that we need to do. This was over a century ago. This is what we need to do. This is what makes our country better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741262">I really like the direction we are going in. I recognize that members from the government have talked about all the funding they have given and what they are doing for this. I just hope they stay on target, stay focused and get it done right. We know a lot of times that sometimes we may put money into it, but we are not sure if it is being spent properly. Are we focusing on what the provinces and territories need? How can we do that? I hope we do get it right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741263">To the member who put this forward, I do have great respect for her. I know she was one of the persons putting a motion forward so that we studied this in HESA. It is really important that we are doing that as well. I hope that we get this right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741264">This is something that we can do together. This is something that we should be proud of, if we come up with a strategy that works. I wish everyone the best on this going forward to make sure it gets to committee and we can look at it as thoroughly as possible.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741265">Mr. Speaker, I, too, am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10866280" Type="4">C-237</Document> on a national framework for diabetes, which was introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253089" Type="2">Brampton South</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741266">I think it is worth pointing out that we are talking about a bill and not a national strategy, even though we have had a lot of discussions about this in the past. The advantage of a bill is that the legal framework makes it possible to ensure better enforcement and better follow-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741267">The bill states that the government has one year to establish the strategic framework and that it must assess the effectiveness of this national strategy five years after the report is tabled. That means that the bill already sets out a schedule and includes it in a legal framework, which is a positive step forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741268">I am saying that because I am referring to the work that the Standing Committee on Health did after second reading and because my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252689" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation> asked the sponsor of Bill C-237, the member for Brampton South, some questions about the difference between what is happening now with the legal framework and the discussions that took place in the past with regard to national strategies. There have been discussions since 2005, and there have been debates about Diabetes 360° since 2018, so we wanted to know why we now need a legislative framework for all of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741269">We were told that having a legislative framework is ultimately a good thing. It ensures that these intentions are not just wishful thinking and that there is follow-through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741270">Ms. Hanson of Diabetes Canada was asked about Diabetes 360°, the strategy that was recommended three times in a row and is also included in budget 2021. She was asked if the government had backed the strategy with funding. She answered that it had not yet done so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741271">After conducting a study on a national strategy, the Standing Committee on Health issued its recommendations. We tried to determine if these recommendations had been implemented by the government. It was not clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741272">Thanks to the work of members, we now have a legislative framework and we can expect, or at least hope for, further outcomes and concrete action to fight diabetes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741273">I want to talk about Bill C-237 sponsored by the member for Brampton South by quoting from subclause 2(2) and speaking about the concerns that the bill addresses. Paragraph 2(2)(a) states that the national framework must include measures to “explain what diabetes and prediabetes are”. It is important to know this and, as MPs, the bill informs us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741274">I would like to provide some statistics. Diabetes affects 11 million Canadians. Diabetes Quebec estimates that in Quebec alone, roughly 880,000 people have diabetes, and a quarter of a million do not even realize it. They are living with diabetes without knowing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741275">Every day, about 20 Canadians die of complications from diabetes. Diabetes is responsible for roughly 25% of heart operations, 40% of kidney failure, and 50% of non-traumatic limb amputations, even today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741276">For Canadians with diabetes, the risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 is twice as high, and the risk of dying is three times higher than normal. It is often harder to treat people with diabetes for viral infections because of the blood sugar fluctuations this can cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741277">This is also about the people affected by diabetes. One in five adolescents with type 1 diabetes also suffers from depression, which is twice as high as the average. This affects people differently than the illness itself. Diabetes is also the primary cause of blindness in adults under 65. Diabetes has a major impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741278">Paragraph 2(2)(b) of the bill states that there must be measures to “identify the training, education and guidance needs of health care and other professionals related to the prevention and treatment of diabetes, including clinical practice guidelines”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741279">The Bloc Québécois position on this is that Bill C-237 must not have an impact on Quebec's jurisdictions. However, we are not against virtue, and I will refer to the principle of the bill, which states that everything must be done in collaboration with the other levels of government, but also with the different stakeholders on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741280">We hope that this means there will be a better distribution of tasks related not only to diabetes prevention and research, but also to caring for individuals with diabetes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741281">Paragraph 2(2)(c) of Bill C-237 states that the bill aims to “promote research and improve data collection on diabetes prevention and treatment”. Just today, we adopted Motion No. 38, which calls for the creation of a standing committee on science and research. We expect that this issue will be of interest to the committee and that it can look into diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741282">Data collection can be done through the Public Health Agency of Canada, which is a federal entity. It is important to do it because Ms. Hanso of Diabetes Canada mentioned in committee that currently, in Canada, it is difficult to say how many of the people who have been diagnosed with diabetes have type 1 and how many have type 2. Apparently that is not yet clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741283">Prevention is especially important, because over 50% of cases of type 2 diabetes are preventable. The importance of prevention in this context is vital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741284">Paragraph 2(2)(d) of Bill C-237 requires measures to “promote information and knowledge sharing in relation to diabetes prevention and treatment”. In terms of prevention, some things fall specifically under federal jurisdiction, like the labelling of less healthy, sugary products. That is part of disease prevention, and it falls under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741285">As I mentioned earlier, regarding the importance of coordination, that has to be done with the provincial governments or health officials, indigenous groups and other stakeholders, to be sure to avoid any duplication in the services offered and in terms of responsibilities. We have to make sure no one falls through the proverbial cracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741286">Paragraph 2(2)(e) of Bill C-237 requires measures to “take into consideration any existing diabetes prevention and treatment frameworks, strategies and best practices, including those that focus on addressing health inequalities”. It is worth taking a moment to discuss the situation of indigenous people. For various reasons, in some communities, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is four to five times higher than in the general population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741287">Investments have been made in the past to try to correct this situation, but we can expect a national framework to be more effective, particularly in three areas. In terms of prevention, we must ensure that awareness campaigns on healthy living are conducted in the communities. We also need better screening to ensure that residents of indigenous communities who have diabetes without realizing it can receive treatment quickly and avoid complications. It is also important to ensure that the treatments adhere to the guidelines and that a consistent approach is taken in order to reduce mortality and comorbidity, since this is a matter that may fall under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741288">Paragraph 2(2)(f) of Bill C-237 reads as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741289">
                <LegislationQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">ensure that the Canada Revenue Agency is administering the disability tax credit fairly and that the credit, in order to achieve its purposes, is designed to help as many persons with diabetes as possible. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741290">As we know, the expenses associated with diabetes are very high. It can cost people with diabetes more than $1,500 per year. It has been reported that 30% of Canadians with diabetes cannot follow prescribed treatments because of the cost. These aspects speak to the relevance of Bill C-237.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741291">Bills like this remind us that it is important for members to work together. It is nice to see something other than what happens during question period, to remind us that we can achieve a great deal when we work together. It also gives us the opportunity to learn more about one another. For instance, I learned that the member for <Affiliation DbId="253089" Type="2">Brampton South</Affiliation> is a trained cardiology technologist and worked in health care for 18 years. I saw how much she cares about this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741292">In closing, I want to emphasize the wonderful collaboration we have seen on this issue with a quotation from my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252574" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation>, who is a member of the all-party diabetes caucus. She often says this in another context, but I think it really applies here: “If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741293">I hope that we will be able to go a lot further to tackle diabetes, for we will have done it by working together as parliamentarians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741294">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak in support of my bill today. I want to start by thanking my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252591" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> who generously gave up his slot so we could complete debate on this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741295">I also want to thank everyone who supported my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="10866280" Type="4">C-237</Document>, an act to establish a national framework for diabetes in Canada, and all members who contributed to the debate on this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741296">I would especially like to thank the organizations that have helped to support the bill: Diabetes Canada, JDRF, Diabetes Action Canada, the CNIB and many more organizations. I would like to thank researchers, like Dr. Peter Senior from the University of Alberta and Dr. Ken Cloth from St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, not just for supporting the bill but for the hard work they do fighting diabetes that will some day lead to a cure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741297">Locally, I would like to thank people like Mayor Brown and the Brampton Council, Mayor Crombie of Mississauga, our Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Lawrence Loh, and the CEO of William Osler Health System, Dr. Naveed Mohammad. They know how important this issue is in our community and across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741298">I know that when we pass the bill and send it to the Senate it will have just as much support there. I give thanks for the support of senators Marie-Françoise Mégie, Nancy Hartling, Patricia Bovey and many others. With a national framework for diabetes we can introduce a nation-wide effort to prevent, treat and finally end diabetes. If we pass this framework, it will help millions of Canadians living with pre-diabetes or diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741299">A national framework for diabetes must identify the training, education and best practices of health care and other professionals who treat diabetes. It must improve data collection and promote information and knowledge-sharing in relation to diabetes prevention and treatment. It must take into consideration any existing frameworks, especially those that focus on addressing health inequalities. Finally, it must fund and promote research that will one day lead to a cure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741300">Last week, I met with Laura from Ottawa west, Nepean. She is a 23-year old who has been living with diabetes type I since she was seven years old. She spoke about how there were early signs. Her teachers and parents did not immediately recognize it for what it was. This is why we need to improve education and awareness so that everyone can recognize the early signs and get treated accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741301">I also met with Dr. Cathy Felderhof from Cape Breton Island, who told me about the challenges of providing care for rural indigenous people and how diabetes interacts with mental health and other social factors of health. It is so important that experts like her and doctors who treat a variety of patients in the regions across Canada are brought together to help develop this strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741302">Indigenous populations face many factors, including socio-economic factors, that contribute to high rates of diabetes and create barriers to accessing proper treatment. In my city of Brampton, one in six community members has diabetes or pre-diabetes. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the challenges faced by people living with diabetes who are at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms. Economic insecurity, lack of physical activity and struggles with mental health during this pandemic have all had a negative impact on those living with diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741303">Treating diabetes is expected to cost the health care system in Canada almost $40 billion by 2028. This projected cost is concerning and it could be reduced if we pass Bill <Document DbId="10866280" Type="4">C-237</Document> into law. A national framework for diabetes would provide guidelines to address diabetes and invest in prevention and education about the disease and in data collection. With this framework, we can see valuable input from stakeholders such as Diabetes Canada, JDRF and programs such as Diabetes 360°. This year, we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto by Sir Frederick Banting and his colleagues. Canada gave insulin to the world. It is time for Canada to once again lead the way in the fight against diabetes.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741308">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern with the Liberal government's failure to support the request by South Africa and India to temporarily waive intellectual property rights through the TRIPS waiver. By failing to support the TRIPS waiver, and by failing to ensure that all people and all countries can get vaccines to their populations as quickly and efficiently as possible, the government is putting Canada on the wrong side of history. This is not where Canadians want or deserve to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741309">The decision to not support the waiver is ethically bankrupt. It will potentially cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands, or possibly millions, more people. It is indefensible, but more importantly it is also not very smart. We have heard so many times before, and I cannot reiterate with enough emphasis, that none of us is safe until all of us are safe. Until people around the world are vaccinated, until this virus is contained and eradicated and until variants stop evolving, we will not recover from this pandemic. We may believe that it is over, but if we fail to act globally, this virus will evolve and we will find ourselves in a second pandemic in which vaccinated Canadians are not protected. It would be a second pandemic that could have been prevented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741310">Why is the government willing to watch more people die? Why is the government willing to see our global economy crumble once again? Is this the price we are being asked to pay to protect big pharmaceutical companies? We should keep in mind that these companies, which use massive amounts of public dollars to develop, test and produce vaccines, are making billions of dollars in profit this year. These companies using public dollars, our money, are profiting off of the pandemic. They are looking for more and the government is obliging. Why choose big pharma over lives? Why choose big pharma over our future? This is not what Canadians want from their government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741311">The United States has said that it will support the waiver. Over 100 countries around the world have supported the waiver. There are 280 European parliamentarians who support the waiver. Members of the <Affiliation DbId="253399" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s own party, Liberal members of Parliament, have called upon the government to support the waiver. Even Pope Francis is urging Canada and all countries to support the waiver. Pope Francis recognizes that selfish politics, such as those shown by the Liberal government, are another variant of the COVID-19 virus. He said, “Another variant is when we put the laws of the market or of intellectual property over the...health of humanity.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741312">The TRIPS waiver is not the only step we need to take to ensure vaccines are available as quickly and as widely as possible, but it is a vital step. It is a tool in the very limited tool box that humanity has right now to fight this virus, and frankly we need to use every single tool that we have at our disposal. The situation is urgent and the repercussions are catastrophic if we fail to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741313">I am speaking from the heart. I am using every means I have to convince the government that it is not too late to do the right thing. It should stop dithering, stop deflecting and stop avoiding the issue by saying it is studying it and thinking about options. It should stop the ridiculous wait-and-see approach that insults the intelligence of Canadians and fails to recognize the urgency of the pandemic. It should do the right thing, support the TRIPS waiver and help the world combat COVID-19 before it claims even more victims.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741314">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for that important question. I am also concerned about that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741315">Our government has been committed to those efforts since the beginning of the pandemic. As a country and as a government, we are a strong supporter of equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines around the world. We are working with our international partners right now. As my colleague is well aware, this is not a decision that can be made by Canada alone. We are working with other countries to eliminate all of the potential barriers to vaccine access, including intellectual property, supply chain constraints and the export restrictions we are seeing around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741316"> Through the leadership of our Ottawa Group, we are promoting the trade and health initiative to the WTO to eliminate barriers, and we are determined to find solutions that will expedite the production and equitable distribution of vaccines.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6741317">I would like to state very clearly for the record that the member opposite is absolutely right that none of us are safe until everyone is safe. However, she is wrong to characterize our government's position in the way that she has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741318">Canada has been working since the very beginning with all of the players around the table at the WTO to find a solution to this issue. Canada is not in a position by itself to grant a waiver. We need to find consensus. In fact, the WTO is a consensus-based organization, so coming out one way or another without having all member states in agreement does not serve any purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741319">What we need to do is look at a text, which is the process we are engaging in now. I am sure the member is following the situation closely and understands that so far the waiver proponents have not proposed anything in writing. We are working toward this and are pushing all of the players around the table to come up with texts so that we can negotiate and move this forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741320">Our government certainly recognizes, just as the member opposite does, that the pandemic is not over anywhere until it is over everywhere. We are committed to finding solutions. We are also committed to finding an agreement that accelerates global vaccine production, but one that does not negatively impact public health here in Canada or anywhere around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741321">We need to discuss IP protection proposals for a waiver that will allow particular COVID-19 vaccines to be available to developing countries. However, we also need to work with all members on some of the other barriers to accessing COVID-19 vaccines. We know what those are, and many of them are related to supply chain constraints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741322">Canada is actively engaged in the work of the trade and health initiative at the WTO. It aims to strengthen global supply chains and support the delivery of essential medicines and medical supplies, including vaccines, all over the world. Canada has also encouraged the director general of the WTO to enhance its efforts to ensure that the WTO plays a role in finding a global solution to this issue and in accelerating the production and distribution of affordable, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741323">I will end by saying that Canada remains a strong advocate for equitable access to vaccines. We remain one of the very important players around the table, encouraging us all to find a text that we can agree. We want to make sure that vaccines are available right across the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741324"> I will point to our leadership as a country. For example, consider our contributions to the access to COVID-19 tools, or ACT, accelerator, and of course our contributions financially to the COVAX facility. To date—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741335">What we have seen with the Liberals over the past six years is an absence of accountability and an unwillingness to stop the insider dealings. We have seen the government block accountability measures that the House has called on it to take, including when witnesses were ordered to appear at committee. Instead, ministers told committees that they instructed the witnesses not to appear and that they believe in ministerial accountability. The House gave a provision in its order to the government that it could produce the staff witnesses or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could appear. He could have done so to exercise ministerial accountability, if in fact the government was genuine in its assertion about the reason staff could not appear at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741336">As we have seen in the last several months, and even since the pandemic began, any time tough questions are asked, committees devolve into filibusters put on by the Liberals. It happened not just at the ethics committee, but at the finance committee, the national defence committee and the procedure and House affairs committee, to name a few. When the House issues an order for witnesses to appear at committee and the government instructs staff members to defy an order of this place, it speaks to the trickle-down lack of accountability and ethics that we have seen with the government. That is why we have, in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, someone who has been twice found guilty of breaking the Conflict of Interest Act and found himself under investigation one additional time, and why multiple ministers have been found guilty of breaking the ethics laws of this place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741338">Mr. Speaker, that is not the case. My friend and I have had this discussion on several occasions, and sometimes one has to agree to disagree. Ever since the 2015 federal election, and even before, the Conservative Party has been personally attacking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and nothing has changed. I think our Prime Minister has done an admirable job in resisting the personal attacks, and he continues to remain focused on Canadians and the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741339">This government, day in and day out, seven days a week, has been there to support Canadians during the pandemic. We have seen that in the establishment of programs. We went from nothing to programs that have directly helped more than nine million Canadians. The member talked about how we prorogued a session. When was the last time the House actually sat during the summertime? The answer is more than 30 years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741340">For the first time in the House of Commons, opposition members were provided the opportunity to ask thousands of questions over the summer. Many of their questions were about issues of ethics. Accusations were flowing. Every rock had to be turned over. The member said that we have been putting money in the pockets of Liberals, but let me remind my friend that billions of dollars were spent and many pockets of Conservative business owners received that money. I suspect that even some Bloc and New Democratic people who owned businesses received money. Seriously, there is no credibility in trying to make it look as if the government is corrupt, none whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741341">The Conservative Party, a number of months ago, lost its focus. Ever since the new leader has taken over the reins of power within the Conservative Party, along with his leadership team, the Conservatives are more focused on being a disruptive force inside the legislative chamber than they are on serving the best interests of Canadians. We see that when the Conservative Party chooses to amplify the issue of corruption when corruption is not there. A good example of that is the recent announcement from the Ethics Commissioner that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was not in a conflict with regard to the WE Charity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741342">As an opposition party, the Conservatives can do whatever they like. However, I will tell Canadians that every member of the Liberal caucus, with the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, will continue to be focused on Canadians in every region of this country. We are committed to building back better, and the budget we just presented is an excellent illustration of that. I am very proud of the way this government has been accountable—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741352">Mr. Speaker, my question today is about the Uighur genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741353">Before I get to the specifics of that, I would like to acknowledge the importance of this week as it pertains to concerns about the situation in China. This week has been designated as a week of prayer for the church in China and the peoples of China by Cardinal Bo, who is the Catholic cardinal in Burma and serves as the president to the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741354">Following his call for this week to be a week of prayer for the situation of Christians and other communities in China, churches and others from around the world have taken up this call. Christians from various backgrounds and denominations are using this week as an opportunity to speak, advocate and pray about the escalating persecution of China's Christian community as well as the human rights abuses and other challenges facing all the communities in the People's Republic of China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741355">Sadly, criticism of China's human rights record is often portrayed as somehow being anti-China, but this call to prayer for China taken up by so many from around the world demonstrates goodwill toward China and good wishes for its people, and the hope China's leaders will one day be a force for the advancement of justice and human freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741356">I am pleased to join my voice to that of Cardinal Bo, Pope Francis and many others in Canada and around the world who are marking this important week to express my concern about the persecution of Christians in China and in particular as well to note the cases of Bishop Vincent Guo Xijin, Bishop James Su Zhimin, Bishop Augustine Cui Tai, Father Lu Genjun, Pastor Wang Yi and Pastor John Cao.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741357">We have seen the horrific persecution of all faith communities in China, and tonight I am following up on a question asked about the genocide of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in China. As best I can understand, the government's position on this is that further investigation is required to determine whether these crimes constitute genocide and if the government of China should allow a fact-finding mission on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741358">I would put it to the government that there has never been in human history a case where a government, in the act of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, has willingly permitted international monitoring or investigation while those crimes were going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741359">In the case of the Rohingya genocide, the government was willing, eventually, to recognize the reality of that genocide even without an on-the-ground fact-finding mission being permitted. The recognition in that case was made as a result of testimony of survivors and satellite footage, and that is the kind of evidence we also have in this case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741360">In fact, the evidence in the case of the Uighur genocide is, if anything, clearer and more conclusive than the evidence that existed in the case of the Rohingya genocide. Of course, the Chinese state is more powerful than the Burmese state, but the government should not choose to invent new higher evidentiary thresholds simply because it is afraid to hold powerful states to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741361">If we are to take at face value the government's claim to not have yet rendered a decision based on the evidence, then we also have to recognize a majority of the government's caucus has disagreed with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet in their conclusion that there is not sufficient evidence here. In any event, the government should explain the nature of the investigation it is pursuing with respect to the Uighur genocide and when it expects this investigation to be concluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741362">In the meantime, one concrete thing we can do short of recognizing this genocide is to fix Canada's failing supply chain legislation. Canadians from across the political spectrum want to see meaningful reforms to prevent slave labour from feeding our supply chains. Emancipation is sadly still a distant dream in certain parts of the world, including in Xinjiang, and we need to do our part to bring that dream closer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741363">Despite announcing a new policy in this area, no imports have been blocked or apprehended. This new policy therefore is clearly not working. We need to pass legislation modelled on the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act of the U.S., which introduces a presumption that slave labour is involved in products imported from places where high levels of slave labour exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741364">Again, back to the main question, could the government explain the nature of the investigation it is pursuing with respect to the Uighur genocide and when it expects that investigation to be concluded? When will the government finally render a decision on whether it believes events in Xinjiang or East Turkestan constitute genocide and trigger Canada's obligations under the genocide convention?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741365">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252804" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> for bringing up the week of prayer that Cardinal Bo has instituted with respect to China. I think it is very important for Canadians to be aware of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741366"> I would also note that in March we had a day of prayer across Canada for Hong Kong, to which parliamentarians were invited. I believe I was alone in that prayer evening. I was really touched by Canadians across the country who raised their prayers for the people of Hong Kong. Other issues were raised as well with respect to human rights in China. These are important human rights cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741367">I want to acknowledge the work of the Subcommittee on International Human Rights on this issue and others as well as the testimonials that have been received from civil society, which have been considered by parliamentarians. I also acknowledge, as the member did, the recent motion carried by hon. members of the House. The government welcomes parliamentarians working together and debating this critical issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741368"> We all agree that the actions by Chinese authorities in the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region cannot be ignored and must be attended to. There is evidence of a sustained and systemic campaign of repression in Xinjiang by the Chinese government. We have testimonials from survivors and we have leaked government documents from credible reports of mass arbitrary detention, repressive surveillance, forced labour, forced sterilization, sexual violence, torture and other mistreatment affecting Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. This is not an exhaustive list of the violations which continue to come to light. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741369">As we have repeatedly said, we remain deeply disturbed by troubling reports of these human rights violations in Xinjiang. Canada also takes allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity very seriously. We take them seriously enough to do due diligence and work with international partners, and work to ensure that we call things as they are in ways that will be helpful and in ways which will engage our partners and not stand alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741370">The Chinese government continues to deny any possibility of human rights violations against the Uighur people. It rejects any accountability for wrongdoing and actively seeks to discredit victims and those who speak out, and we address that regularly. It is the utmost priority for this government to safeguard and protect the rules-based international order, which includes the protection and promotion of human rights around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741371">Canada has repeatedly called for an investigation so that impartial experts can observe and report on the situation first-hand. We have a responsibility to work with others in the international community. We do not stand alone. We are stronger and better when we work with the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741372">Whether a first-hand visit by experts is possible or not, as the member argues, we must ensure that such allegations are investigated by independent experts who can review available information, including first-hand accounts whenever possible. We have been clear in our view that human rights violations are occurring against Uighurs and more rigorous and comprehensive investigation evaluation should occur in co-operation with allies, and we continue in that vein. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741373">I want to underscore what the Government of Canada has already done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741374">On January 12, we adopted a comprehensive approach to the human rights situation in Xinjiang, including measures against forced labour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741375">On March 22, through coordination with the U.K. and the U.S. and solidarity with the UN, there were new sanctions against four officials and one entity for participation in human rights violations in Xinjiang. We raise concerns regularly alongside our partners at the UN, including at the UN Human Rights Council at the UN General Assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741376">On May 12, Canada co-sponsored a virtual event at the UN in New York alongside 15 countries to raise awareness about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741377">It seems to have escaped the minds of the opposition that Canada continues to provide leadership in this, and we will continue to do it. We will continue to work with others to defend fundamental human rights and freedoms and call upon China to uphold its international obligations, and we will do it well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741473">As certain regions in Canada start to reopen, we must remember that we are not done fighting the virus. Our determination to win this fight and provide Canadians the support they need is stronger than ever.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741474">This year's budget, which I tabled on April 19 and which Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> would enact, meets the three fundamental challenges facing Canadians right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741475">First, we must defeat COVID. That means buying vaccines and supporting provincial and territorial health care systems. It means enforcing quarantine rules and it means providing Canadians and Canadian businesses with the help they need to get through lockdowns and to fully recover when COVID is defeated. COVID will be defeated. Vaccines are available to Canadians in ever-growing quantities, and they are working. More than 60% of adult Canadians have received their first dose of the vaccine. Canadians are doing their part and getting vaccinated. My thanks go to team Canada. Together we can do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741476">Second, we must punch our way out of this COVID recession. That means making sure that hard-hit businesses can rebound, start growing and start hiring again. It also means helping the people who have been the hardest hit by this recession: women, young people, racialized Canadians, low-wage workers and small businesses. We are doing just that. When fully enacted, this budget will create nearly 500,000 new training and work opportunities for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741477">Our third major challenge is to create long-term economic growth and to build a more resilient Canada, a country that is better, more fair, more prosperous and more innovative. That is why we intend to invest ambitiously in the green transition and the new jobs that come with it, in digital transformation and innovation, and in infrastructure like housing, transit and the trade corridors that we need as a dynamic, growing country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741478">The COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous pressure on our health care systems. That is why, in Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>, we propose to provide $4 billion through the Canada health transfer to help the provinces and territories ease the immediate pressure on their health care systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741479">Additional funds for health care will help pay for the many different procedures that had to be delayed because of the pandemic. This will help build the resilience of our health care systems. That is what Canadians deserve and need.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6741480">A full recovery from COVID requires a new, long-term investment in social infrastructure. That means providing early learning and child care, student grants and income top-ups, so that the middle class can flourish and more Canadians can join the middle class. We know that without child care, parents, usually mothers, cannot work outside the home. That is more painfully clear now than ever. We intend to invest $30 billion over five years, reaching $9.2 billion annually, to provide high-quality, affordable and accessible early learning and child care across Canada. Our goal is an average cost of $10 a day across the country within five years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741482">To minimize economic scarring and to power a robust recovery, we must bridge Canadian businesses through to the end of this crisis. The wage subsidy, rent subsidy and lockdown support had been set to expire next month. This budget extends these measures through to September 25, 2021.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741483">In order to help those who still cannot work, we will maintain flexible access to employment insurance for another year, until fall 2022. Furthermore, to support Canadians who are not covered by employment insurance, the Canada recovery benefit will be extended by 12 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741484">We are also proposing a four-week extension of the Canada recovery caregiving benefit, which would bring it to a maximum of 42 weeks at $500 a week. Similarly, the employment insurance sickness benefit period will be increased from 15 weeks to 26 weeks. These measures provide tangible and measurable assistance to the people who need help now.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6741485">As we build a resilient recovery, it is critically important that we help low-wage workers. They work harder than anyone else, for lower pay. They work on the front lines, and COVID has revealed to us all that the work they do is truly essential. We intend to expand the Canada workers benefit, extending income top-ups to about one million more workers and lifting nearly 100,000 Canadians out of poverty. We also propose to introduce a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741486">Young Canadians must be at the heart of our recovery, not just to help them bounce back from the COVID recession, but because their future success is critical to our success as a country. We intend to make college and university more accessible and affordable. We will create job openings in skilled trades and high tech, and we will double the Canada student grant for two more years, while extending the waiver of interest on federal student and apprentice loans to March 2023. This will mean lower costs for the approximately 1.5 million Canadians who are working to repay their student loans. Our budget will also make an important change so that nobody earning $40,000 per year or less will need to make payments on student loans, and the cap on monthly student loan payments will be reduced from 20% of household income to 10%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741488">We are therefore proposing a one-time payment of $500 in August 2021 for old age security pensioners who will be 75 or older in June 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741489">Furthermore, this budget provides for an additional 10% increase in old age security benefits for seniors aged 75 and over, as of July 2021.

              <ParaText id="6741492">Madam Chair, I would like to begin by thanking the minister. Budget 2021 is a transformational document that will allow us to continue the fight against COVID-19, help us punch out of this pandemic recession and, importantly, ensure that everyone gets to benefit from the growth that we expect to see on the back end of this pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741493">The pandemic, quite obviously, has not impacted everyone the same. If I can be blunt, there are a lot of people who look like I do who have fared better than many Canadians. Indigenous Canadians, Black Canadians and women have suffered disproportionately when it comes to the financial impact COVID-19 has had on their lives and careers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741494">The minister spent a portion of her speech focused on the importance of Canada's first early learning and child care strategy and that will be the focus of my comments and question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741495">From my perspective, there is both a moral and an economic imperative that justify a game-changing investment in excess of $30 billion in this child care and early childhood education strategy. It is clear to me that women more often than men choose to stay home at the beginning of their career to provide care for young children. The economic equation that a lot of families consider understandably justifies their decision to have one spouse stay home in a two-parent household when they look at the cost of care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741496">I have friends who are spending $4,000 a month for just two kids in child care in some Canadian cities. It may not be that expensive at home, but when a lot of people in my community are looking at whether they can afford the cost of care, they are choosing not to work even though they may want to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741497">From my perspective, the opportunity to provide care will give more families the choice to work should they want to. It would help more women fill gaps that exist in the labour market, which will boost productivity. However, importantly, there are solutions to business problems and scientific developments that may be locked in the mind of someone who is choosing to stay home because they cannot afford the cost of care, and we are all losing out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741498">Does the minister see the economic case that would allow this investment to pay for itself? Also, does she believe that having a gender-balanced cabinet and a task force on women in the economy, made up of women from Canada, actually helped influence the arrival of this important and game-changing decision?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741500">For more than 50 years, since the Royal Commission on the Status of Women urgently urged the Canadian government to set about building a universal system of early learning and child care, early learning and child care has been a feminist cause across Canada. What I believe is different today is that there is a wide appreciation in our country, and indeed around the world, that a system of early learning and child care is also an essential economic strategy for driving growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741501"> In fact, today we are lucky to have the deputy minister of finance, Michael Sabia, with us. Deputy Minister Sabia and his team have calculated that, once we build a universal system of early learning and child care across Canada, that will drive economic growth more powerfully than any policy Canada has implemented since NAFTA, and it will increase growth by more than 1.2%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741503">Madam Chair, I would appreciate it if you allowed the minister to finish answering my questions about division 8 of part 4 of Bill C-30.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741504">This division enacts the new retail payment activities act, which establishes an oversight framework for retail payment activities. Changes in the banking and financial services sector mean that financial technology companies, or fintech, which include GAFA, now occupy markets traditionally reserved for financial institutions. Obviously, protecting clients and consumers as well as the banking and financial system as a whole is crucial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741505">My first round of questions is about unauthorized transactions and parties' responsibility. The proposed legislation would protect clients from unauthorized use and errors in electronic funds transfers. The new legislation appears to cover this issue in subclause 17(1) under operational risk management and incident response. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741509">However, I do want to give him an answer. The Bank of Canada will be responsible for ensuring that payment service providers comply with the framework and it will maintain a registry of regulated payment service providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741510">The proposed legislation would require payment service providers to establish a risk management framework to identify and mitigate risks. The requirements of the proposed framework would be based on international best practices. These requirements would be set out in the regulations, and may include, for example, reliability objectives; specific policies regarding physical security or information technology security to manage cyber risk; and continuity plans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741521">Discussions with the provinces and territories revolve around business practices for payment service providers. Federal public servants, under the leadership of Mr. Michael Sabia, will continue to work closely with the provinces and territories on issues related to business practices like disclosure, accountability and dispute settlement mechanisms, and will review options regarding consumer protection, which is of great interest to my colleague across the way.

              <ParaText id="6741522">Madam Chair, my second round of questions is about asymmetry in client and consumer protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741523"> We know that, in the case of an unauthorized use of electronic funds transfer, such as a credit card, a debit care, a prepaid payment product such as a prepaid card, or even an online or virtual payment, a bank client's maximum liability under subsection 627.33(1) of the Bank Act and section 5 of the Canadian Code of Practice for Consumer Debit Card Services is $50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741524"> Aside from the requirement to notify, which is also in the bill before us, this requirement is more detailed and rigorous in other acts and regulations, such as the Bank Act. There are also other protective mechanisms, such as the grace period for the minimum payment on a credit card balance, the prohibition of overlimit fees and assurance that prepaid products will not expire, to name just a few here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741525">Another consideration is the bank's obligation to behave responsibly. These standards are laid out for bank clients in the Bank Act but not in Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741526">Although the level of protection for the end user has not yet been determined, can the minister confirm at this point that a user doing business with a fintech company, not a bank, will not be held liable for the unauthorized use of an electronic funds transfer?</ParaText>

That is why we have introduced a digital services tax.

              <ParaText id="6741553">Here is the contrast. At the same time as there is a refusal to bring in a wealth tax, hundreds of thousands of Canadians who currently depend on the Canada response benefit will see that benefit slashed in just a few weeks. In the middle of the third wave those benefits will be slashed from $500 to $300 a week. The question is how these people will put food on the table. How will they keep roofs over their heads? Particularly as we see record homelessness, why would the government slash the benefit?</ParaText>

I am so pleased that 5.9 million Canadians have been supported through the CERB, 1.95 million Canadians have been supported through the CRB and 5.3 million Canadian jobs have been supported through the wage subsidy, including 621,000 jobs in the member's province of B.C. As the member opposite also knows very well, his province of B.C. and other provinces across the country are making great strides in the fight against COVID. They are opening up the country. They have put forward clear and strong plans, and our programs have to adapt accordingly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741556">Madam Chair, as we well know, the Parliamentary Budget Officer has also evaluated that a modest pandemic profits tax would bring in about $8 billion. This is the kind of thing we did in the Second World War when we were all in this together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741557">We know that this would make a difference. The minister has refused to answer my question about the CRB being slashed. There are two other measures from the NDP that the government can support. First, in the budget the government has acknowledged the chronic and desperate poverty that so many Canadian seniors live under and has proposed to raise the OAS by 10%, but only for Canadians over the age of 75. Canadians from 65 to 75, who are the bulk of Canadian seniors, do not have access to that. Canadian seniors organizations have reacted. They are asking the government to change that situation, and the NDP again has proposed an amendment that would ensure that the OAS increase goes to all Canadian seniors. The government has also refused to extend the moratorium on student debt payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741558">The question is very simple. The government is refusing to make sure that a pandemic profits tax, a wealth tax, is in place so that we have the wherewithal to make these important adjustments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741559">Will the government support ensuring that all seniors have access to the OAS increase, and will it put in place a moratorium on student debt payments?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741560">Madam Chair, I am very pleased that in the budget we were able to keep our campaign commitment to raise the OAS for seniors 75 and older by 10%. We appreciate, as I think do all members of the House, that as a person gets older, their needs are greater, their savings may be running out and their ability to work diminishes. I am very pleased that for Canadians 75 and older we are able to offer this additional support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741561">The member points out something else, though, which is so important to me, to our government and I believe to all Canadians. In addition to supporting seniors in our budget, we need to invest in young Canadians. This pandemic has hit our youth hard and they have sacrificed for us. They have sacrificed to preserve the lives and health of their parents and grandparents. That is why I am so pleased that this budget makes an unprecedented $5.7 billion investment in young Canadians. That investment will double the Canada student grant for two additional years, it will extend the moratorium on federal interest and it will mean that 450,000 low-income student borrowers will have access to more generous repayment assistance.</ParaText>

As well, the finance minister is refusing to put in place a moratorium on student debt payments that so many student organizations across the country have called for. These are not answers that Canadians will support at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741563">The minister said earlier that the government was taking action against tax havens. The very simple fact is, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer pointed out in 2019, that Canada loses over $25 billion every year in tax revenues that flee to overseas tax havens. There has not been a successful prosecution by the government of any Canadian or any Canadian company tied to the Bahamas papers, the paradise papers or the Panama papers. Thousands of Canadians are using these loopholes to avoid paying taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741564">CRA employees went to the finance committee last summer and said that they did not have the tools to take action against this tax evasion.

The federal government, within four days of the pandemic hitting, as the finance minister well knows, offered an unprecedented $750 billion in liquidity supports to the banking industry. That was within just a few days. The profits so far, and we will see further profits announced this week, have been over $50 billion for Canada's big banks. Why were there no requirements in the banking industry at all for Canada's big banks to access these massive amounts of liquidity supports?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741582">As members know, part of my mandate is to work with the whole of the federal government to better incorporate quality of life measurements into government decision-making and budgeting. This important work began before the COVID-19 pandemic started disrupting our lives, prompting many Canadians to reflect on what they value most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741583">The pandemic has affected many dimensions of Canadians' quality of life, from health impacts and job losses to mental health and social isolation. It has also shone a light on the long-standing inequalities that Canadians continue to face, such as the gender imbalance in caregiving responsibilities, systemic racism, and the gaps in Canada's social safety net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741584">It is clearer than ever that traditional economic indicators such as gross domestic product alone cannot measure Canadians' overall well-being. Recognizing the importance of factors beyond GDP does not imply a reduced focus on investing in a strong economy or prudent fiscal management. In fact, these investments are critical to achieving and sustaining a better quality of life.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741585">Increasing Canada's GDP through productivity growth, labour market participation and investment is crucial for raising Canada's national standard of living now and into the future. However, our government strongly believes that the quality of life of all Canadians should be a key component of policy-making and budget decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741586">Quite frankly, Canadians agree. A study commissioned by the government last summer found that while one in two Canadians feels that stronger growth in Canada's GDP is important to day-to-day life, nearly three-quarters of respondents felt that it is important to move past solely considering traditional economic measurements, such as levels of economic growth, and also consider other factors like health, safety and the environment when we make decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741587"> The recent budget that our government tabled on April 19 reflects this belief. It is as much about finishing the fight against COVID and jump-starting our economy as it is about investing in measures that will increase the quality of life for Canadians, initiatives such as child care, mental health support, protecting the environment, affordable housing and public infrastructure. Through the development of a quality-of-life framework, introduced as part of our recent budget, our government is putting Canadians' quality of life at the centre of our policy and investment decisions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6741588">Budget 2021 uses our quality of life framework, which is based on evidence about the factors that matter most to Canadians: economic prosperity, health, environment, social cohesion and good governance. This will give us a way to measure progress beyond simply relying on GDP growth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741589">Economic growth and prosperity are still critical to us. They sustain Canadians' standard of living. However, we need a broader understanding of what constitutes progress, one that encourages us to think about the big picture and consider the distribution of outcomes across the population and the long-term sustainability of outcomes. Our work has been guided by conversations with experts, stakeholders, and nations that are advanced in their thinking about well-being, and by feedback from Canadians themselves. The result was a made-in-Canada approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741590"> By using a broader suite of indicators and measuring factors such as mental health, environmental impacts, employment, social trust and post-secondary education, our government will be able to better measure and assess the impact of key measures on Canadians' quality of life. This includes looking at the distribution of outcomes, opportunities across demographics and in places, and whether today's prosperity could potentially undermine tomorrow's living standards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741591">This integrated approach can serve as a major benchmark, like a north star for our government's policy development and budgeting, articulating priorities based on what matters most for Canadians' quality of life and underpinning how we monitor progress in building back better after the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6741592">Our government has already started using the framework to consider how each proposal for our recent budget could affect these various dimensions and indicators, in order to help us achieve the right mix of measures to ensure a strong, inclusive and sustainable recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741593">Take, for example, our government's historic commitment to establish a Canada-wide early learning and child care system. The pandemic has emphasized that it is not just a social issue, but an urgent economic one as well. It is a cornerstone of our jobs and growth plan, and it would provide jobs for workers, the majority of whom are women, while enabling parents to reach their full economic potential and creating a generation of engaged and well-prepared young learners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741594">As the members of this House would agree, while this measure would advance GDP growth, measuring its impact in terms of GDP growth alone would surely understate the benefits of this investment. As someone who literally had to start a day care in my basement because I had no other options as an entrepreneur and small business owner, I can tell members how transformative this would be for so many people with families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741595">We also considered systemic racism, which can have devastating consequences on the well-being of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741596">New support measures should have positive impacts on a wide range of areas that are important for quality of life, including discrimination and unfair treatment, self-reported mental health, skills development and its effect on job opportunities, and a sense of belonging to the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741597">Those were a few examples of how the framework helped guide decision-making in this budget. I am proud to say that members can pick any measure from our recent budget and check annex 4 to see what impact it is expected to have on quality of life.

Evidence-based decision-making is foundational to good governance and to Canadians' trust in their institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741599">To help us get there, our recent budget announced proposed investments of $13.8 million over five years and $2.2 million ongoing to enable Statistics Canada to improve quality-of-life measurements and address key data gaps while bringing together key economic, social and environmental datasets into a user-friendly format that would better support decision-making and budgeting.</ParaText>

To me, it is important that we understand there is value in a forest before we cut it down, that the time we spend at home is every bit as valuable as the time we spend at work and that the people in our lives are every bit as important and certainly more important than the money in our bank accounts. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741606"> To illustrate the importance of this point, when people call my constituency office, they are not calling about Canada's GDP growth the month prior.

Though they might be watching the monthly job statistics in the abstract, they are very concerned whether they and their kids have an opportunity to find a job in the community where they grew up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741607">In this recent federal budget, we have taken a major step to implement indicators where we can track the impact that the measures are going to have on the quality of our constituents' lives and not only on the macroeconomic indicators we traditionally rely on, like unemployment rates or GDP. Certainly, those traditional economic indicators are extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741608">Could the minister highlight some of the investments made in budget 2021 as a result of these indicators and what are the next steps to implement a quality-of-life framework to ensure that, going forward, governments make decisions based on how they will improve the quality of life for Canadians rather than simply GDP?</ParaText>

Maybe she is right. A billionaire American tax cheat got richer off students and Canadian taxpayers during the pandemic as a result of the Liberal government's poorly designed wage subsidy program in this regard. Now Canadians with federal student loans will know that every time they make a payment, an American tax cheat will get richer. I guess that is okay by the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s standards. I am not sure, but it sounds like it is.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741683">Madam Chair, I am thankful for the opportunity to stand today to participate in this committee of the whole debate and, most importantly, for the opportunity to highlight our government's proposed investments, which will help us deliver and build back a better, fairer and more prosperous future by investing in Canada's green transition and more green jobs. Today I will speak for eight to nine minutes, and then I have some questions for the <Affiliation DbId="253402" Type="96">Minister of Middle Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741684">As outlined in budget 2021, job growth means green growth. It is about leaving behind a healthy planet with clean water and clean air for our children and their children. It is about addressing the current climate crisis, and it is about securing jobs today and creating the careers of the future. Our recent budget sets out a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030 and puts us on a path to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It proposes funding to achieve our 25% land and marine conservation targets by 2025. Since the release of budget 2021, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has announced that Canada will increase its emissions reduction target by 40% to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741685">By making targeted investments in transformational technologies, we can ensure that Canada benefits from the next wave of global investment and growth. Investing now in areas such as clean fuels and carbon capture will foster well-paying, middle-class jobs now and for many years to come. Canada can and will foster jobs and sustainable growth by building on what we already do so well. The resource and manufacturing sectors that are Canada's traditional economic pillars, including energy, mining, agriculture, forestry, steel, aluminum, automobiles and aerospace, will be the foundation for our plans to continue toward a more sustainable and green economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741686">That is why we proposed a historic investment of $5 billion over seven years in the net-zero accelerator on top of the $3 billion we already committed in December for this program. This funding will help even more companies invest to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions while growing their businesses, and will help build and secure Canada's clean industrial advantage by decarbonizing large emitters, transforming key sectors and accelerating the adoption of clean technologies across the economy that are needed to meet our goal of net zero by 2050. This investment will help cut our pollution, spur clean technology innovations, attract major investments, create middle-class jobs and foster the development of key supply chains to ensure that Canadian industries and workers can use their low-carbon advantage to compete and win.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741687">Tackling climate change and achieving net-zero emissions also require Canadians and Canadian industries to reduce the release of harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in every way possible. Carbon capture, use and storage, also known as CCUS, is an important tool for reducing emissions in sectors that emit the most. This tool uses cutting-edge technologies to capture carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion and industrial processes, or directly from the air. The captured carbon can then be stored deep underground or used to create new, innovative products. CCUS is the only technology currently available that can produce negative emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741688">Budget 2021 proposes to introduce an investment tax credit for capital invested in these projects, with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 15 megatonnes annually. We also know that investments are needed to support research and development activities that will lead to technological breakthroughs, reduce costs and ensure that Canada remains at the forefront of the global market for oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741689">That is why budget 2021 proposes to provide $319 million in funding to Natural Resources Canada to support research and development activities in carbon capture, use and storage technologies to improve their commercial viability. Together, these proposed actions related to the CCUS will help Canada achieve our carbon reduction emissions goals and position Canada as a leader in the provision of cleaner energy and innovative new technologies around the world.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741690">Canadians are well aware that climate action starts at home, and home energy retrofits can have a big impact on emissions reductions. Whether people replace drafty windows, improve insulation to keep their houses warm in the winter and cool in the summer or install heat pumps, retrofits will help Canadians make their homes more energy efficient and can also help to better protect their homes from climate risks. These retrofits also make our homes more comfortable, reduce our energy bills and create good middle-class jobs, especially for skilled workers and tradespeople. They can also help spur clean growth by developing an industry for energy efficient retrofits, including the development of a Canadian supply chain for high-efficiency home renovation products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741691">The 2020 fall economic statement put forward a program to provide Canadians with one million free energy audits and up to 700,000 grants, valued at up to $5,000 each, to complete energy efficient retrofits for home improvements. To further help homeowners, budget 2021 proposes to provide $4.4 billion to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to help homeowners complete home retrofits through interest-free loans worth up to $40,000. Loans would be available to homeowners and landlords who undertake retrofits identified through an authorized EnerGuide energy assessment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741692">In combination with the grants announced in the fall economic statement, this would help eligible participants afford deeper, more costly retrofits that have the biggest impact in reducing a home's environmental footprint and energy bills. The program will also include a dedicated stream of funding to support low-income homeowners and rental properties serving low-income renters, including co-operatives and not-for-profit-owned housing. The program would be available this summer, and it is estimated that more than 200,000 households would benefit from this opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741693">Finally, before I conclude, I would like to touch on zero-emissions technology. As more countries commit to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the demand for zero-emissions technology will only grow. With a highly educated and motivated workforce, Canada is well positioned to use this as an opportunity to create sustainable jobs for Canadians and continue toward a more sustainable economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741694">Strengthening our manufacturing sector and creating good, well-paying jobs is key to growing a resilient, competitive middle class. That is why budget 2021 proposes a 50% reduction in the general corporate and small business income tax rates for businesses that manufacture zero-emissions technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741695">In conclusion, our government knows that we are at a pivotal moment. Just as the inventions of the steam engine and personal computer triggered transformative economic shifts, today the global economy is quickly turning green, and it is only the beginning of the sustainable future that our planet needs. It is essential for the prosperity of both current and future generations of Canadians for Canada to be at the forefront of this great transformation. Our government knows the importance of making sustainable decisions, and we will do whatever it takes to provide a greener future for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741696">I will now to turn to my questions for the <Affiliation DbId="253402" Type="96">minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741697">In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis remains a significant concern for all Canadians from coast to coast. Last year we announced the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act with a goal of net-zero emissions by the year 2050. We know that investors are putting their money into just about anything that has the word “green” attached to it, and the act will help achieve net-zero emissions. However, we must ensure that it is not a barrier to investment and is a strategic plan for competitiveness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741698">While some members of the House continue to debate whether climate change is real and whether we should take official positions on it, our government has a real plan to address climate change. I would therefore like to ask the <Affiliation DbId="253402" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> to explain why it is important to adopt a climate lens and how it will impact the lives of Canadians in our fight to end rapid climate change. Specifically, I would like her to reference the $1.4-billion project proposed in the budget to respond to climate-related disasters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741701">As my colleague said, COVID-19 has shown us that Canadians have what it takes to come together, mobilize and take action in the face of this crisis. The climate crisis is just as great a challenge.

These funds will spur Canada's shift to innovate net-zero technologies and attract the large-scale investments needed to meet our goal of net-zero by 2050. It will also help Canadian firms grow and create the jobs of our low-carbon future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741803">Budget 2021 is a historic document. It is the first budget tabled by a female <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. It is also a document that sets an ambitious path for this country for the years to come, while healing the economic wounds of the past year. We cannot go back and alter the destruction the pandemic has wrought on our lives and on our economies, but we can do our best to ensure a better future by laying down the foundations for a resilient and inclusive recovery. I would like to outline the measures that budget 2021 would enact to create jobs and particularly help low-wage workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741804">The burden that COVID-19 has placed on low-wage workers cannot be overstated, and the past year has shown how much everyone relies on the important work that many of these workers do. It is a sad reality that the worst economic impacts of the pandemic have been suffered by those who could least afford it. Low-wage workers have been up to six times more likely to suffer layoffs than higher-income Canadians. Many of these workers are young people, new Canadians, visible minorities and women. Many Canadians are struggling to get by while supporting families through part-time, temporary and low-wage jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741805">To support low-wage workers in the federally regulated private sector, budget 2021 proposes to introduce legislation that will establish a federal minimum wage of $15 per hour, rising with inflation. This would directly benefit more than 26,000 workers. To support low-wage workers who have been most negatively affected by the pandemic and make our workforce stronger, budget 2021 proposes to expand the Canada workers benefit to support about one million additional Canadians in low-wage jobs, helping them return to work and increasing benefits for Canada's most vulnerable populations. This important measure would raise the income level at which the benefit starts being reduced for single individuals without children and for families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741806"> As we all know, the Canada emergency wage subsidy was one measure that kept businesses afloat during the crisis and enabled them to keep paying their employees when revenues took a nosedive. The program has helped more than 5.3 million Canadians keep their jobs. It is set to expire in June 2021, but if we want to bridge Canadians through the rest of the crisis, continued support is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741807">To give workers and employers certainty and stability over the coming months, budget 2021 proposes to extend the wage subsidy until September 25, 2021. Extending this support means that millions of jobs will continue to be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741808">The budget also puts forward a new program, the Canada recovery hiring program, which would provide an alternative support for businesses affected by the pandemic to help them hire more workers as the economy reopens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741809">The government also plans to take action to help the workforce grow and meet demand by helping employers train and reskill workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741810"> To help Canadians gain skills for good jobs in growing sectors, budget 2021 proposes to invest $960 million over three years for a new sectoral workforce solutions program. This funding would help design and deliver training that is relevant to the needs of businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, and to their employees. This investment will help connect 90,000 Canadians with the training they need to access good jobs in sectors where employers are looking for skilled workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741811">This measure will also help diversify sectors by ensuring that 40% of supported workers are from under-represented groups, including women, persons with disabilities and indigenous people.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741812"> Some 45% of Canadians lack the literacy, numeracy and digital skills that are increasingly necessary to succeed in jobs in the knowledge economy. Budget 2021 proposes to invest $298 million over three years in a new skills for success program that would help Canadians improve their skills. This program would enable approximately 90,000 Canadians to improve their literacy and essential skills to better prepare for, get and keep a job, and adapt and succeed at work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741813">When the economy reopens many people will return to their previous jobs, but for some, changes in the economy will mean they will need to find new jobs. To address this need and help Canadians find new jobs as quickly and easily as possible, workers need to be able to rapidly adapt and upgrade their transferable skills for newer industries. Budget 2021 proposes to provide $250 million over three years for an initiative to scale up proven industry-led third party delivered approaches to upskill and redeploy workers to meet the needs of growing industries. This initiative will help approximately 15,500 Canadians connect with new work opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741814">Finally, I would like to add a thought about personal support workers. These individuals perform jobs that are mentally and physically exhausting, but they often do not enjoy the same job protections, compensation and benefits as many of their peers in the health care sector. To follow through on a commitment made in the fall economic statement 2020, budget 2021 proposes to provide funding of $27.6 million over three years for My65+, a group tax-free savings account offered by Service Employees International Union Healthcare. The funding for this portable savings tool will support incentives for worker participation.</ParaText>

If we are to have a full and fair recovery, Canada needs all workers to rejoin the workforce and to make sure they earn a decent living so as to generate economic growth and raise the standard of living and quality of life for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741816">Even before the pandemic, housing costs were rising and were a serious concern for a lot of young Canadians who wanted to buy their first home, including many from my riding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741822">The high cost of housing across the country is affecting almost every Canadian. That is exactly why we are taking action on several fronts to alleviate the pressure on low- and modest-income Canadians. For this reason, budget 2021 will invest $2.5 billion and reallocate $1.3 billion in existing funding to speed up the construction, repair or support of 35,000 affordable housing units.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741823">This will also help families, young people, low-income Canadians, people experiencing homelessness, and women and children fleeing violence find a safe and affordable place to call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741824">Of this investment, $1.5 billion will be allocated to the rapid housing initiative to build units over the next 12 months. It is important to note that at least 25% of these funds are allocated to and reserved for women-focused housing projects. This investment will add more than 4,500 units to the affordable housing market, building on the 4,700 units we created as part of the $1-billion investment included in the fall economic update.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741825">My hon. colleague also mentioned the importance of helping women fleeing violence. I want to note that budget 2021 provides $315.4 million over seven years, starting in 2021-22, through the Canada housing benefit to increase direct financial assistance for low-income women and children fleeing violence to help with their rent payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741826">These measures are in addition to our work to advance a national action plan to end gender-based violence and the budget 2021 proposal to invest $200 billion over two years, starting in 2021-22, to support organizations fighting gender-based violence. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741914">Canada's COVID-19 economic response plan has proved absolutely fundamental in bringing Canadians and businesses through these COVID-19 shock waves and stabilizing the economy. We delivered job protection through the Canada emergency wage subsidy, liquidity support to businesses through programs like the Canada emergency business account and income support to individuals through the Canada emergency response benefit and other recovery benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741915">Canada undertook what has been among the largest and most quickly implemented fiscal responses in the G7, at over 23% of GDP with budget 2021 investments included. While these fiscal costs have been high, we must bear in mind that these decisions were necessary to ensure the safety and health of all Canadians. Analysis by the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, confirms that in the absence of these direct support measures, Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio would not have been much different from what it is today.</ParaText>

A failure to support Canadians and businesses would not only have left Canadians alone when they needed our help the most, but would have resulted in almost as large a debt burden, greater human misery and greater long-term economic scarring. The actions we have taken were effective and appropriate. Our support has helped keep food on the tables of millions of families and has staved off a flood of bankruptcies, kept the businesses we depend on going, and preserved our capacity to make a strong recovery. As the IMF has confirmed, our economic response plan was a cost-effective investment to avert what would have been a catastrophic economic collapse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741917">As a result, the Canadian economy is positioned for a strong recovery and is already showing signs of strength, with Canada's GDP rising by 10% annualized in the fourth quarter of 2020. Economists have significantly revised their forecasts for recovery upward since the fall economic statement. Following a record decline in real GDP in 2020, it is expected to grow by 5.8% in 2021 and by an additional 4% in 2022. The projected level of real GDP by the end of 2022 is almost 2% higher than projected in the fall economic statement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741918">In addition, real GDP is expected to return to its pre-pandemic level this fiscal year, about six months earlier than previously expected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741919">As everyone knows, we originally projected a deficit of up to $381.6 billion for 2020-21. However, thanks to a strong economic recovery aided by the remarkable resilience and ingenuity of Canadians across the country, we have spent less than we provisioned for. We are now estimating a deficit of $354.2 billion for the current fiscal year, significantly below our previous forecast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741920">The investments in jobs and growth in budget 2021 will help put the deficit on a downward trajectory. As noted in the budget, the debt-to-GDP ratio should fall to 49.2% by 2025-26, and the deficit will be only 1.1% of GDP.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6741921">We are seeing these positive results because of the investments we have made toward the recovery of our economy, which will enable us to repay our COVID debt. That is why budget 2021 proposed game-changing investments in housing, early learning and child care, students, small businesses, innovation, public transit, broadband and the transition to a cleaner and greener economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741922">These investments will permanently bolster Canada's capacity for economic growth. We know that Canada is a country with tremendous human and natural resources to drive growth, and this budget will fuel that. These are investments in our future and they will pay great dividends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741923"> The current low interest rate environment means that we can make growth-enhancing investments that will continue to raise our GDP growth and strengthen our ability to pay down the COVID debt in the future. These investments are not only an investment in our economy, they are also an investment in the lives and futures of Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741924">We will continue to focus on Canadians who have been most affected and ensure that our recovery includes specific measures to continue to support them as needed. We will create jobs by investing in the infrastructure that supports our communities and the social and economic well-being of Canadians. We will support clean growth and a more prosperous future for Canadians by investing in world-leading research and innovation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741935">Our government is committed to promoting both official languages, and it recognizes the role that they play for Canadians across the country. We allocated a total of $8.7 million to modernize the Official Languages Act and ensure that it better serves our country's linguistic duality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741936">As my colleague pointed out, French-language education is the key to having bilingual citizens. Our investment of $180.4 million to improve French immersion and French as a second language programs in our schools and post-secondary institutions will guarantee that our students receive a high-quality education in French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741937">We also know how important it is for students living in linguistic minority communities to receive an education in their mother tongue.

              <ParaText id="6741938">What is more, budget 2021 proposes an investment of $81.8 million to support the construction and renovation of educational and community spaces that serve official language minority communities. These measures are essential to promoting linguistic duality across the country, supporting official language minority communities and diversifying our economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741941">I would like to also ask the <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> another question with respect to tourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741942"> The tourism industry is important in northern Ontario and certainly across Canada. It has been one of the sectors that has been impacted greatly by the pandemic. Many local tourism businesses have shut down and stopped providing services from coast to coast to coast to do their part in keeping Canadians safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741943">In 2019, tourism accounted for 1.8 million direct and indirect jobs throughout our country. The government recognizes that the impacts of the pandemic will continue to be felt by these businesses throughout the recovery process. In response, the government has created a plan to best support the tourism industry through initiatives like the tourism relief fund and other investments to promote Canada on the international stage once international travel is permitted, allowing us to once again open our borders to international visitors on a larger scale so they can experience the many things our great country has to offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741944">Could the <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> briefly explain why the tourism relief fund and other measures taken, such as those supporting safe air travel, are crucial for tourism businesses and local economies?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6741945">Madam Chair, our government knows the tourism industry has been one of the most impacted sectors of our economy and we are committed to supporting its recovery. That is why we have extended the Canada emergency wage and rent subsidies to continue to support employees in the tourism sector. The Canada emergency wage subsidy has already helped more than 5.3 million Canadians to keep their jobs, and the Canada emergency rent subsidy and lockdown support has supported more than 154,000 organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741946">Budget 2021 also proposes to invest $500 million toward the tourism relief fund to support local tourism businesses in their recovery process and position them for future growth. My colleague from northern Ontario pushed that really hard with FedNor, ensuring it had the appropriate investments to support tourism in northern Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741947">We will also allocate $400 million through Canadian Heritage and regional development agencies to support major and local festivals and other events to attract tourists to our beautiful country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741948">We know the importance of tourism in our economy and we plan to dedicate $100 million to Destination Canada to support marketing campaigns to encourage both Canadians and international visitors to travel our great country.</ParaText>

Before the budget was tabled, Quebec had just one demand: an increase in federal health transfers that would cover 35% of expenses. There are sound reasons for this, in light of the health, social and economic crisis we have been facing for many months as a result of the pandemic. The government rejected Quebec's one demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741955">How did the government respond? It responded by investing in national long-term care standards and interfering in home support programs, which is not what Quebec asked for. In fact, quite the opposite.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741962">I believe that Quebec and the provinces need predictability, and the provinces need to be able to fully support their own health jurisdictions. The provinces do not need paternalistic measures that would tell them what to do or interfere in their jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741963">I will now talk about the old age security pension. In Canada, the retirement age was brought back down from 67 to 65, and the government is pleased with itself for doing that. Every Canadian is entitled to the old age security pension starting at 65, whether they worked or not. It is a universal social program. Everyone can count on that pension as of age 65.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741964">The government is saying that in its budget, it is honouring its commitment to increase the old age security pension by 10% starting at age 75, but it is compromising the universality of old age security. The government is telling people who get old age security at 65 that they will have to wait 10 years to get an increase that they should really be getting at 65, considering seniors have the same needs at 65 as they do at 75.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6741970">Madam Chair, poverty and vulnerability affect people of all ages, and that is why a social program was introduced to provide an old age security pension. For many women and many people, it is their sole source of pension income. I understand from the reply that this discrimination will remain, which is a first and sets a precedent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741971">With respect to employment insurance, members will recall all the measures implemented to support nine million workers who found themselves unemployed overnight. Emergency measures had to be put in place because the EI system was not fulfilling its role, as the former governor of the Bank of Canada, who is highly respected, told the Standing Committee on Finance. The President of the Treasury Board himself admitted last spring that the reform of the system had been delayed too long for it to meet the challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741972">In the last Parliament, the Liberal government pledged to reform the EI program. This budget, however, only extends the temporary measures until September 2021, and adds an eligibility criterion that is welcome because it is reasonable, but only for a period of one year. As the witnesses who appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance stated, there are many gaps and the pandemic is not over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741973">Can you assure us that if you keep this temporary framework for a year, you will be open to the idea of fixing the remaining gaps to properly protect workers affected by the pandemic?

              <ParaText id="6741976">With regard to our employment insurance program, I generally agree with the Bloc Québécois member, and I think that all Canadians agree with us. The pandemic has shown that there are Canadians who are not covered by our programs. Our worker support system was designed for another economy and for another time. However, the economy has changed and our system needs to change too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741977">I want to thank all members of the House for supporting the government when it had to very quickly create new programs to support Canadians in a time of crisis. That is a good thing that we did together. I am pleased that Bill C-30 extends those emergency measures until the end of September and extends the more flexible EI requirements for another year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741978">That being said, I agree with the member that there is still work to be done and that we need to do it together. If there is another question, then I would like to talk about the Canada workers benefit, which is also important in this area.</ParaText>

It is politically desirable to reform the employment insurance system, which leaves workers in seasonal industries, women and young people out in the cold.

              <ParaText id="6741989">Madam Chair, it is an absolute pleasure for me to participate in this committee of the whole debate and speak this evening to budget 2021. I will be focusing most of my remarks on how our budget has a number of measures to help small businesses and, in turn, how this is good for our recovery and economic growth moving forward. Among many things in budget 2021, there is a plan to make investments in Canada's businesses so they can hire and train workers, who will, as a result, have more money to spend, spurring our recovery and growing an economy with more opportunities for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741990">Let us start at the beginning. An essential part of Canada's fight against COVID-19 has been the unprecedented federal support for Canadians and Canadian businesses. This support has helped millions of families in the depths of this crisis. One in four Canadians was receiving federal COVID income support. The Canada emergency wage subsidy, currently set to expire in June 2021, has helped more than 5.3 million Canadians keep their jobs and has provided more than $79 billion in support to the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741991">To continue to support Canadians through the rest of this crisis, and to give workers and employers certainty and stability over the coming months, Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the budget implementation act that is currently before the House, proposes to extent the wage subsidy until September 25, 2021. It also proposes to gradually decrease the subsidy rate, beginning on July 4, 2021, to ensure an orderly phase-out of the program as vaccinations are received and as the economy reopens. Extending the support will mean that millions of jobs will continue to be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741992">The wage subsidy has been an absolute lifeline for so many businesses in my riding of Davenport, from many of the artistic and cultural organizations, such as the House of Anansi, an iconic Canadian publishing house, to businesses such as Teixeira Accounting Firm, one of the many small businesses that serve the local community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741993">Another key support for our small businesses has been the Canada emergency rent subsidy and the lockdown top-up support that has helped more than 180,000 organizations pay their rent, mortgage interest and other expenses. The rent subsidy provides eligible organizations with direct and easy-to-access rental support. An important aspect of this support is that it is accessible directly to tenants and landlords. This program is also scheduled to end in June 2021, but to help Canadians weather the remainder of this crisis until the recovery, they need continued support. As in the case of the wage subsidy, budget 2021 proposes to extend the subsidy for the rent and the lockdown supports until September 25, 2021. It also proposes to gradually reduce the rate of the subsidy for the rent to ensure the program's orderly phase-out as vaccines continue to be rolled out and the economy reopens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741994">Again, these emergency supports have been tremendous lifelines to many businesses in my riding of Davenport, from hair salons to small theatres to many of the restaurants across my riding, among many other types of organizations and businesses. There is no way they could have survived without these supports. I know they are so grateful for this ongoing support, although I will say they are so excited at the prospect of opening up sometime soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741995">Let us move on to speak to supports contained in Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> that would assist small businesses succeed moving forward. They are some of the new programs we are proposing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741996">To provide further support to our small businesses, Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30</Document> proposes the new Canada recovery hiring program for eligible employers who continue to experience qualifying declines in revenues, relative to before the pandemic, and who need help with restarting. This proposed program would provide an alternate support for businesses affected by the pandemic to help them hire more workers as the economy reopens. The proposed program is designed so that the rates for both the wage subsidy and the hiring program will slowly decrease over time, creating a strong incentive for employers to begin hiring as soon as possible to maximize their benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741997">For businesses that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, hiring the workers they need to grow is a cost they may worry about taking on. The government wants these businesses to recover and grow by hiring more people, so that workers are at the forefront of our recovery. The proposed Canada recovery hiring benefit would offset a portion of the extra costs employers take on as they reopen, either by increasing wages or hours worked or by hiring more staff. This support would only be available for active employees and would be offered from June 6 to November 20, 2021. The aim is to make it as easy as possible for businesses to hire new workers as the economy reopens.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="55">(2255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6741998">It is obvious that Canadian businesses must adopt new technologies and go digital to meet the needs of their customers and remain competitive. The pandemic has precipitated the digital transformation of the economy as businesses, workers and consumers increasingly do business online. To spur recovery, jobs and growth, the federal government is launching Canada's digital adoption program, which will create thousands of jobs for young Canadians in addition to helping up to 160,000 small and medium-sized businesses adopt new digital technologies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6741999">This program will offer two components of support to businesses. Eligible shopping street businesses will receive micro grants to help offset the costs of the digital switchover and gain digital trainer support from a network of 20,000 well-trained young Canadians. Some companies will need more comprehensive support to adopt these new technologies. A second component will therefore be offered to businesses located outside the shopping streets, such as small food manufacturing and processing businesses. Support provided to these companies will focus on expert technology planning consultants and the financial options required to implement these technologies. These measures will match more businesses with customers seeking what they have to offer and ensure their continued success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742000">One of the inspirations for this new program is the digital main street, a program providing grants and services to Ontario businesses to help them digitize. Our federal government helped fund an expansion of this program in June of last year, which helped countless businesses in my riding adapt to the pandemic by going online. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742001">The chair of Little Portugal on Dundas BIA went before the finance committee last week. In the chair's opening remarks to the committee, she let us know that the BIA had been at the forefront of adoption of the digital main street program and it was helped, in large part, by having a Portuguese speaker on its digital service squad. They have indicated the importance of making our new digital adoption program accessible to main street businesses, some of whom may be slow to adopt new technologies, including language barriers, but they have stressed how vital this program is in helping businesses recover from the pandemic and adapt for the future, improving their chances of long-term sustainable success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742002">Finally, I want to speak in the final minutes of my remarks this evening on budget 2021 about investments in immigration. As we know, Canada is the destination of global talent. With our declining birth rate and increasing retirement rate, Canada's future economic success depends on good immigration policy moving forward and a modern, efficient immigration system to meet the needs of incoming applicants and new Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742003">As part of budget 2021, the government is proposing $428 million to develop and deliver an enterprise-wide digital platform that will replace the current legacy case management system. What this means is that Canada's immigration system will see an improved application process and support for applicants. We understand that this type of investment is needed to ensure immigration levels in Canada remain well supported. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742004">When Stephen Poloz, former governor of the Bank of Canada, testified recently before the finance committee, he made a very important point. He said that immigration was Canada's most important economic growth engine, just as it was in the 1950s and 1960s. Therefore, anything we can do to make that process more efficient will be a good investment in Canada's future growth. It is important we recognize that the money we put into our immigration system is an investment, not a cost. It will pay huge dividends in economic growth for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742005">Budget 2021 invests in a more prosperous future for us all as we move past and come out of this pandemic. We are meeting this challenge head on and we are laser-focused on growth and the economy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6742007"> I now have a couple of questions for the <Affiliation DbId="253400" Type="4">Associate Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, and my first question is on mental health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742008">For over a year, Canadians have been forced to adapt their lives to a new normal to keep their communities safe. Many students have switched to attending classes online, and everyone misses having in-person interactions with their loved ones, peers and colleagues. Last year, 40% of all Canadians, and 60% of Canadians with pre-existing mental health conditions, reported that their mental health had worsened. Many of my constituents have shared how these changes and finance-related stress have caused them to feel severe burnout and fatigue due to the stress of this global pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742009">We realize that this pandemic has taken a great toll on the mental health of Canadians, and that is why the government launched the Wellness Together Canada portal last April. This portal supports the mental health of Canadians by providing live support, treatment and reliable information on mental health and well-being. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6742011">Mr. Chair, COVID has certainly exposed the mental health struggles that Canadians faced even before the pandemic, and the impacts of COVID on our interactions with our friends, families and coworkers have taken a toll on the mental health of many Canadians. That is why our government has a plan to support the mental health and well-being of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742012"> This past year has been particularly difficult for certain groups, including indigenous people, Black and racialized Canadians, front-line workers, health care workers, youths and seniors. We know that the pandemic has affected these groups in different ways, and that is why we plan to invest $100 million toward supporting projects for innovative mental health interventions for these groups. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742013">Budget 2021 also proposes an investment of $45 million toward the development of national mental health service standards, which would ensure that Canadians receive the high-quality services that they need and deserve. In combination with this initiative, our government aims to invest $62 million toward the Wellness Together Canada portal to provide Canadians with the tools and resources that are essential in supporting their mental health.</ParaText>

They have continued to demonstrate extreme resilience in their adaptation to changing public health guidelines. A number of local businesses in my riding have adapted by offering curbside pickup and launching online stores, such as Three Fates, the TuckShop and the Dufferin Grove Farmers' Market, and many residents continue to get the necessities they need through these online businesses. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6742107">Let me start by saying that in Manitoba, in reading the Winnipeg Free Press today, there is good reason to have hope. I will read from an article about the first dose being given to 60% of adult Manitobans. It says, “Manitoba is less than two weeks away from vaccinating 70% of its eligible population against the novel coronavirus in a final push to bend the COVID-19 curve of Canada's hot spot.” </ParaText>

I know that people are genuinely concerned. Upon reflection, one of the things I think about is how the province and the people have come together. We have seen our health care workers in particular, and so many others, recognize the need to serve. They have stepped up to the plate once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742109">Our ICUs are packed. We have to have people go out of province. We understand how important it is that the population continues to play that supportive role.

When I reflect on it, I go all the way back to day one, over a year ago, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that we needed to focus our attention on the pandemic, and on fighting and battling this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742110">He told Canadians back then that we would be there for Canadians, for real people and our businesses. If we review the things that have taken place, there are many indications showing how we have been able to get to the point we are at today. I do not have any problem whatsoever in looking beyond our borders and feeling good in terms of where Canada is today. I attribute our success to date to that team Canada approach.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6742111">The federal government did not do this on its own. There was very much a coming together of different levels of government. We saw provincial governments, municipal governments, non-profit organizations and private businesses all come together, recognizing that we needed to work together in order to overcome this world pandemic and the damage that it was causing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742112">From the very beginning we saw a government that understood in a very real way that we had to be there. Being there meant a program, coming from nowhere, that we know as CERB, which served over nine million Canadians. Our population is 37.5 million people. Think about what it would have taken and about the fine work of our civil servants and all those involved in making that program a reality. It put disposable income in the pockets of Canadians when Canadians needed it, when they were concerned about how they were going to pay their mortgages and their bills. Bills do not stop coming in even when someone does not have an ability to generate income because of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742113">Imagine the number of businesses that would not be here today if the government, working with others as a team, had not developed programs that have become the pillars of the federal government throughout the pandemic. I am thinking of the emergency business account, emergency commercial rent program and lockdown support. I loved the wage subsidy program. That program saved tens of thousands of jobs. It kept people working during the pandemic. Not only was it good for individual Canadians, but it was also good for businesses. There was the business recovery benefit, recovery sickness benefit and recovery caregiver benefit. Those were the pillars that were there to ensure that the federal government had the backs of Canadians. That was so very important. By doing that, we are in a far greater position to be able to build back better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742114"> We look at the budget implementation bill and the budget, which we heard about from the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. It is an incredible, progressive budget that supports Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it in a very real and tangible way. We can look at what it is doing for child care. We can look at the budget's potential of getting more people engaged and the contribution that that engagement is going to have on Canada's future growth. We have recognized the value of long-term care and standards. We have learned a great deal from the pandemic and we can take advantage of what we have learned and build upon it. That is what this budget is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742115">Canada has hope today because we have a government that recognizes the value of working as a team with other levels of government, with Canadians. We have a government that recognizes the value of bringing forward a budget, which is going to make a difference. That takes me to my first question for the <Affiliation DbId="272434" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance</Affiliation>. Reflecting on the budget implementation bill and how it is a continuation of allowing us to build back better, so that we will have a stronger and healthier future for the next generation and today's generation, could he provide his thoughts on why this bill is so critically important at this time to continue to be there in a real, tangible way for all Canadians from coast to coast to coast?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6742118">It makes me think back to the early days of the initial shutdown nearly a year and a half ago and the phone calls that were coming in to constituency offices like mine right across Canada. People were worried about putting food on the table. Business owners were worried about keeping their lights on and their doors open. Workers wanted to be kept on payroll so they knew a cheque would be coming in and they would also have access to their benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6742119">We stepped up in a way that I was very proud of, with programs like CERB, helping more than nine million Canadian workers; the wage subsidy, keeping over $5 million on the payroll; and the emergency business account, helping businesses keep the lights on. Many of these benefits are extended in the budget implementation act that was been tabled recently. We know that we need to continue supporting folks until this emergency is over. Thankfully, due to the expedited vaccine rollout, it looks like that may come sooner rather than later.</ParaText>

Historic investments in excess of $5.7 billion will support young Canadians and reduce barriers of access to education, so we will not only create cost savings in the short term for them but set them up for long-term success.</ParaText>

We have investments to help deep home energy retrofits that will put people to work, reduce our emissions and reduce the cost of electricity.</ParaText>
