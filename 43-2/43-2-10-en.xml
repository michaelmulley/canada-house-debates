We know that this is an issue in China and in other places where organs are taken forcibly, sometimes from political prisoners, sometimes through exploitation.

I would be remiss if I did not mention and thank Justin Tinker and his advocacy committee for this proposal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276799">Petitioners point out the economic and personal losses owing to accessibility issues in recent years for residents travelling to and from their homes on this New Brunswick island in the Bay of Fundy. The only way to access Campobello Island most of the year is by exiting Canada, driving through Maine for almost an hour and crossing back into Canada on a bridge to Campobello. Each time a family or business do this, they pass and are inspected at U.S. customs and again at Canadian customs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276800">This petition calls on the federal government to adopt a team Canada approach and facilitate a permanent solution that allows Campobello residents to access the rest of New Brunswick without having to travel through the United States, something every other Canadian from coast to coast takes for granted every single day, whether they are travelling within their provinces or across this magnificent country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276801">The federal government can do this by working with the province to secure a ferry vessel that provides year-round service. Campobello residents are not asking for special treatment. My riding has three other beautiful islands, Deer Island, White Head Island and Grand Manan, which all have ferry service within New Brunswick. It is time similar treatment was extended to the great people of Campobello.</ParaText>

We need to continue to be there for our entrepreneurs. We need to continue to be there in order to create jobs and make sure that our economy rebounds. We will continue to keep the House apprised of our spending and to act in the interests of all Canadians.</ParaText>

In fact, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253024" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> has a really important business: V2V Black Hops, a social enterprise brewery built by veterans, has not been eligible for the wage subsidy because of a technicality. </ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253142" Type="2">Mr. Majid Jowhari (Richmond Hill, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6276817">Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House today to speak in support of the Speech from the Throne. The Speech from the Throne lays the foundation of our government's direction and goals, and how we will work to achieve them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276818">Before I begin, I want to recognize the hard work the front-line workers in my riding of Richmond Hill have continued to provide throughout the pandemic. Grocery store clerks, health care workers, law enforcement officers, first responders and small business owners are some of the many who have been the backbone of our community at this time. I want to thank them for their services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276819">In this time of need, members of our community have also been coming together to ensure they are not alone in the fight to flatten the curve. I have seen communities in Richmond Hill organize food drives, create handmade masks for local centres or donate their time and money to local organizations that serve our most vulnerable. It is my honour to represent the people of Richmond Hill and to continue to advocate for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276820">This speech was created with everyday Canadians like the residents of Richmond Hill, in mind: Canadians who are working to support their families, who have local businesses, who give back to the community and who rely on the government to provide them with public services that empower them and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276821">Through the four major pillars of our speech, we told Canadians that their voices and advocacy had been heard, and that their opinions, indeed, matter. The four pillars are fighting the pandemic, supporting Canadian businesses, addressing the gaps in our social systems and standing up for who we are as Canadians. These will guide our government to best support the people of Canada and create a stronger, more resilient country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276822">The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that when people are suffering, the onus is on the government to ensure that they remain stable and are equipped to fight this virus. From the outset of COVID-19, our government has had a plan to tackle the challenges brought on by the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276823">Our first step was to ensure that Canadians and Canadian businesses were protected. This was why we introduced the Canada emergency response benefit. Our response ensured Canadians did not have to worry about putting food on the table or paying bills by providing direct support to them. The CERB was a temporary program that helped close to nine million Canadians through a very difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276824">We ensured that businesses could keep their employees on the payroll by introducing the Canada emergency wage subsidy. The wage subsidy protected over 3.5 million jobs and preserved our nation's small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276825">We also took further action by creating the made in Canada initiative, which invested in domestic PPE manufacturers and provided support to Canadian scientists researching and developing a vaccine. By investing in Canadians, we will fight the virus. As the throne speech highlighted, that support will continue. The Canada emergency wage subsidy will be extended until next summer so that businesses like Benson Lock in Richmond Hill can continue to keep workers employed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276826">Many Canadians in Richmond Hill benefited from the CERB, and the improved employment insurance program will continue to support them during this time. For those who do not qualify for EI, the Canada recovery benefit will help get them back on their feet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276827">To recover our economy, we must invest in our vulnerable industries. I have heard first-hand from those in the travel and hospitality industries, which have been hit the hardest. By expanding the Canada emergency business account to help businesses with fixed costs, and improving the business credit availability program, we are providing direct support to most vulnerable industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276828">We are also investing in communities. The safe start agreement allocated $19 billion to municipalities to start their economies. Richmond Hill received $4 million to address associated start-up costs and protect the community. This funding for my riding ensured that safety measures were in place and public services could be maintained. It also enabled the municipal government to prepare for what is now the second wave of the virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276829">As we prepare our municipalities, it is also imperative that we consider the long-term impact of the initiative and how it affects our environment. Climate action is a key component of our government's mandate. After consulting with climate activists and organizations in my riding, including Neighbours for the Planet, BlueDot and Drawdown, I understand the urgency of a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. The government will create millions of jobs for Canadians by retrofitting homes to save energy costs for families and by supporting investment in renewable energy and clean technology solutions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6276830">We will also invest in our cities to deliver on fast public transit. As the representative of a thriving suburban community, my constituents rely on convenient and affordable transit options to go to work. We will transform the way we power our communities through the clean power fund and become a world leader in clean technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276831">As we work to protect our planet, we must also do the same to protect the most vulnerable in our communities. That is why addressing the gaps in our social security system is a key priority for this government. Our nation's seniors have worked hard to build this country, and we owe it to them to provide the best long-term care. By working with the provinces and territories to create a new national standard for long-term care, we will allow our seniors to receive the best support possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276832">We will also increase old age security once a senior turns 75, and boost the Canada pension plan survivor benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276833">These initiatives will benefit many seniors' organizations and long-term care centres in my riding. Seniors program organizations in Richmond Hill, such as Community and Home Assistance to Seniors, CHATS, and The Mariann Home are able to provide quality support and care to Richmond Hill seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276834">Next I would like to acknowledge another aspect of the speech that resonated with my riding and me. I have had the chance to work with organizations within Richmond Hill that address homelessness in our community, and the commitment to eliminate chronic homelessness in Canada is of great importance. The government's historic national housing strategy will increase investments in rapid housing in the short term, and will partner with not-for-profits and co-ops to find the best solution. The government will work with organizations like 360° Kids in my riding, which provides support to homeless youth in the York region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276835">This week is Mental Health Awareness Week. On the subject of mental health, our government understands that the mental health crisis in our country has reached a tipping point and it is urgent that we invest in community programs. As the chair of the parliamentary mental health caucus, I have worked with various stakeholders to advocate for more investments and resources in mental health research and support for those struggling. We will invest in people like Kathy Mochnacki from Home on the Hill Supportive Housing, whose organization provides resources for individuals with mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276836">I am so glad to see a commitment to increasing intersectional wellness resources so more people can receive the support they need. I believe that supporting and recognizing the diversity of those in our community is crucial to uniting us as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276837">The last point I would like to mention is our government's plan to combat racism. The pandemic has exaggerated and highlighted what many of us already know: there is still much work to be done in the fight against systemic racism. I represent a riding that is incredibly diverse. Of the population of Richmond Hill, 60% identify as a visible minority and 57.4% are immigrants. The need for a comprehensive strategy to address racism is long overdue, and this government has proved that it will do that by continuing to fight hatred and discrimination, as well as by economically empowering disadvantaged communities so we can all succeed. The recently announced Black entrepreneurship loan fund, as well as initiatives aimed at strengthening indigenous communities, show that this government is committed to addressing systemic discrimination and empowering all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276838">As members can tell, this plan is ambitious, but it is necessary to protect and support Canadians. The benefits outweigh the costs, and keeping Canadians on their feet is the most important goal of our government. To quote the speech:</ParaText>

Before I address the speech directly, it is important for Canadians to remember that we are debating a new Speech from the Throne because the Prime Minister prorogued Parliament for six weeks to avoid accountability. All of the committees that are investing his WE scandal were shut down, and that was the point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276856">With a new session of Parliament, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is hoping that all 7,000 of his fluffy but empty words in the throne speech will distract Canadians from his corruption and the WE scandal. I believe that Canadians are a lot smarter than the Liberals give them credit for. This necessary reset, as the government prefers to frame it, was supposedly required to respond to new realities exposed by the pandemic. In actuality, Parliament was perfectly capable of responding to the pandemic prior to prorogation and the Liberals only wasted valuable time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276857">The Conservatives will continue to hold the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government accountable, and we will keep fighting for the answers that Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276858">To respond to the details of the throne speech, I note the government has tried to sell the throne speech as a bold and ambitious vision for Canada. However, the speech has completely missed the mark and is only more proof of the government's reckless economic policy and poor grasp of Canada's economic strengths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276859">The government has signalled that it will be taking on more debt but has yet to provide a fiscal framework. We have no idea of how the Liberals plan to pay it all back. The government does not seem to understand that debt incurred by the government is debt incurred by everyday taxpaying Canadians. These are people like our grocery store clerks, our nurses, our teachers and so on. Without a fiscal framework, how can we be assured that our children and the future generations of Canadians are not going to be overwhelmed by the government's debt?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276860">The throne speech claims that the government is “guided by values of sustainability and [fiscal] prudence”, but the absence of a fiscal framework thus far proves otherwise. We have a government spending recklessly without a fiscal plan as Canadians navigate the challenges of a global pandemic. The Liberals are racking up a credit card without telling Canadians how or when it will all be paid back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276861">At the same time, the throne speech reveals a flawed plan for economic recovery. Canada is at a major crossroads in its development. There are some very clear choices that confront us right now. These choices are even more important in light of the economic crisis brought on by the COVID-19 shutdown. The government has chosen to effectively shut down our economy by restricting resource development and exports, with economic policies like carbon taxes, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, which restricts new pipelines from being built, and Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which is preventing exports of crude off the west coast, and generally discouraging investment in Canada's resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276862">Exports are the lifeblood of the Canadian economy. In 2018, 56% of Canada's exported goods were directly from our resource industries. The government seems to think that it can replace these core industries with pixie dust. Despite expressing a commitment to economic recovery, the government has continued to neglect and even hinder resource development in this country during a time when we need these resources the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276863">It has been akin to a hockey team benching its all-star players while trying to come back from being down six goals. These industries drive our economy, provide the jobs that Canadians depend on and provide the government revenues that keep our health care and education systems alive. These industries have made Canada the great nation that it is today, yet there was zero mention of supporting struggling resource workers. There was just a continued promise to sacrifice their lives by killing their industries with more taxes and regulations, an added double carbon tax hiding as the Canadian fuel standard and more. Do members know what the worst part is? It is that the government is taking the tax dollars paid by hard-working Alberta oil and gas workers and giving those dollars away to subsidized competitive industries that aim to end their existence. That sounds fair, does it not?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6276864">There was also a very large issue that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> completely skipped in the Liberals' reset: western alienation. These Liberals stand up in the House day after day and completely deny that anyone in western Canada, in particular anyone in Alberta, feels alienated from Ottawa and the central government. I am here to say, as many of my colleagues have previously, that it is real and it is growing. The Liberals stand to say they are giving more money to Alberta than former prime minister Harper did. They accuse us of making up this crisis. We could not create this even if we tried. The alienation of Alberta is caused by the current government's antienergy, antiwest, anti-Alberta far-left policies that are causing this divide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276865"> Albertans have never wanted a handout or to be bought. They just want the government to get out of the way. We want to be allowed to get back to work doing what we do best: extracting minerals and other resources from the ground, adding incredible value to them and selling them to the world. We have amazing resources and opportunities in this country, but the government wants to ignore them until they go away, because resource development does not fit into its ideological framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276866"> So many people have said this before me, but let me add my voice. Canada's oil and gas producers, miners, farmers and, in fact, everyone who participates in this economy care about the environment. Canada is leading the world when it comes to environmental sustainability. The investment in innovation and clean technology is incredible. I am fortunate enough to live among those who are leading this incredible innovation, which is taking place not just in the oil sands but in all of our extractive industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276867">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to talk about balance, but he has achieved none of it. When hundreds of thousands are out of work and suicides are skyrocketing, that is an indication that the Liberals do not care about the economy side of this equation. We do not need to pit one region of this beautiful country against the others when we share common goals. A strong economy and environmental protection can go hand in hand, and we have already seen this happening in Canada. I wish that the government would stop listening to the far-left voices that are opposed to all resource development and seek that balance, even though these voices are also at the government's own cabinet table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276868"> We are so blessed to live in a region flush with resources that Canada and the world require to maintain our high standard of living. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in resource development. These same industries employ a significant number of first nations Canadians, as high as 6% of the oil and gas workforce. More and more first nations are taking ownership positions in large projects. All Canadians have a mutual desire to see these succeed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276869">Unfortunately, all we have heard from the government is its desire to ban single-use plastics. Where would we be during this pandemic without plastics? In literally every room in a hospital they are crucial. Masks are single-use, as are the gloves that so many people are wearing when they go out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276870">If the Liberals are truly interested in a team Canada approach in responding to the global pandemic, the government must provide a fiscal plan that ensures fiscal stability for future generations and an economic recovery that does not ignore our country's core strength of resource development. However, it seems the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is only interested in racking up the credit card—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6276889">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to enter into the debate on the throne speech and to express some very serious concerns I have with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276890"> The throne speech, at least in English, was nearly 7,000 words, with many catchphrases and talking points but very little substance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276891">I would like to address two themes. The first is why the government felt that it was even necessary to have a throne speech. Second, I would like to point out some specific challenges I have with the throne speech itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276892">Regarding the prorogation of Parliament, I find it incredibly disturbing that the government felt it should shut down Parliament, and not just with the prorogation. The last eight months were bad enough, but in the middle of several concurrent investigations into the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> conduct, Parliament was shut down. It shut down committees, members of Parliament and Canadians, truly. There is one place in the country that allows all the voices of Canadians to be heard, and that is within the hallowed walls of this chamber. The Prime Minister, in an extraordinary abuse of executive authority, used a legitimate parliamentary mechanism to shut down investigations into his own conduct, and that is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276893">Unfortunately, but not surprising, after several months of denial and flip-flopping, when the government finally figured out, I think on March 13, that the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic was actually serious and it changed course and we saw the first bill for some emergency relief measures brought forward, even though members of my party had brought up concerns about why there were no increased measures at airports or other actions being taken to ensure Canada would be better prepared to deal with the threat of this global pandemic. However, instead of it being simply about emergency relief, it was about an incredible abuse of executive power. We saw an attempted power grab, unlike anything I have seen in the country's history. The government wanted unlimited spending authority for more than a year and a half. In what democracy would that ever be deemed acceptable to even propose let alone justify it in the midst of a global pandemic? When Canadians deserved and needed help, the government looked out for nothing other than its own power. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276894">For members opposite who are curious about some of the aspects of parliamentary procedure and who say we need this to be a legislative reset, I asked a question of one of the members from the Liberal Party here just a few minutes ago. He somehow suggested that the six weeks was necessary to ensure the Liberals could consult with Canadians on the throne speech. It is interesting that he mentioned a few examples about how he did town halls and whatnot. He also suggested other members were not talking to their constituents, which is insulting. I was asked to respond, but since I did not have a chance during the questions and comments I will respond now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276895">It is unbelievable and speaks to the Liberal elitist mentality to suggest that somehow their prorogation allowed them to have an inside track on influencing the future of the country in a minority Parliament. They should well know that it is this place that allows all voices to be heard, not simply Liberal Party voices. The Conservatives received more votes in the last election than the Liberals. The Liberals had a significantly reduced mandate after the last election, yet it seems they have refused to accept the will of the Canadian people when it comes to their place in Parliament and the fact that Parliament is truly an essential service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276896">My last point on the concerns around why we have a throne speech today is that the government seems to play quick and fast with all aspects of how it does business, such as manufacturing urgency with the passing of Bill <Document DbId="10867434" Type="3">C-2</Document>. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6276897">We could have been debating this for weeks. It could have been passed weeks ahead of the deadline, yet the government waited until the eleventh hour and showed up at a press conference. Then the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">House leader</Affiliation> tweeted out that this was a confidence motion, that it must be passed or we could go to an election and Canadians would suffer as a result. It was circumstances manufactured by the government. That is typical Liberal elitism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276898">I digress in that regard and will move on to some of the serious concerns I have with the throne speech. I summed it up simply to my constituents when they asked me to describe in a sentence or two my feelings on it. I said that it was vague, expensive and Ottawa knows best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276899">On the vague aspect of it, there were few concrete measures. The Liberals talked about their four pillars of a recovery. They have a lot of catchphrases and slogans. If there was an award for catchphrases and slogans, the government would get it. It seems to be copying from various campaigns, even other election campaigns from other democracies around the world. It throws in these catchphrases and hopes that people will somehow believe they will get the job done. On this side of the House, we know that is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276900">It is unfortunate that most of the aspects of the throne speech are simply recycled Liberal promises. I point to one example, which is its promise to plant two billion trees. It promised this in the last election, yet in the year that has passed, it has planted zero trees. However, we have an oil sands company that has planted millions. This speaks to the bigger context of the throne speech. Many promises were recycled. The Liberals seem to think that making these grand promises and having no plan for delivery somehow serves the best interests of Canadians, and that is simply not the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276901">That is one of many examples. What could have been an opportunity to see many specific concrete paths forward for our country, we saw very few. This is unfortunate. It was a huge missed opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276902">Further, it seemed to be a vanity project for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He prorogued Parliament for six weeks and had the Governor General read a throne speech, a significant aspect of our parliamentary tradition that takes the focus off the politics of the country and allows our head of state to outline an agenda. However, that was not good enough for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister had to have his face on television to continue his sorry trend of cottage chronicles, to have a televised address that simply repeated things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276903">I have much more to say, some of which I have addressed in other speeches, like the unity crisis. The fact is that we are six months into a fiscal year. I know many people who work in the Jim Flaherty building down the street, named after the former Conservative finance minister. There are incredibly intelligent and capable finance people in the department, yet the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said yesterday that it would not be prudent to estimate what the deficit would be. I know many of the people in the Finance Department have a good idea. I suspect it has more to do with the fact that Liberals are scared of what Canadians will think when they find out the cost and lack of accounting associated with their spending. At a time when all Canadians know we need to support those who need it, doing so without a plan is very unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276904">My last point is this. The Ottawa knows best mentality is best represented on page 18 of the throne speech. In talking about a national pharmacare strategy, the Liberals use a word when they talk about working with provinces to develop a pharmacare plan, of which there is no detail. They say that they will only work with “willing” provinces and territories.</ParaText>

In fact, I find it interesting that he has done two speeches on the throne speech. He seems to be the one that is really truly willing to defend his own government's record. Many other members do not seem to be willing to ask members on this side questions about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276912">Regarding the prorogation and many of the questions that we were able to ask, it speaks to the government's attitude. It is all style with no substance. Liberals were happy to have a question period, but it did not want Parliament to actually do the tough work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276913">When it comes to prorogation, many provinces prorogue on a regular basis. It could have simply been a prorogation on the Order Paper for that day. In fact, in most provinces, that is what we will see. A legislature will sit in the morning, and it will then prorogue so the lieutenant governor can do a throne speech in the afternoon.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6276915">I could have pretty much made the same speech myself. I find it amazing sometimes how much we see eye to eye on certain things, like the fact that the Liberals shut down committees and Parliament so that we would stop talking about the infamous WE scandal, or the example of the Speech from the Throne that at the end of the day did not offer anything new and was just a rehash of old Liberal promises. Then there was the infamous address to the nation, when we were told to wash our hands. The Liberals are putting on a rather odd little show.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276916">However, one part of his speech gave me pause, and I would like to ask him about that topic in particular. He said that some oil companies have done more for the environment than the Liberals. I agree with him on that, but is that a reason to rely on the oil companies for a climate change strategy? It seems to me that with oil there is no doubt that we will produce more greenhouse gases and that we will not address the problem of climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6276919">Canadians are faced with a choice. We could have government policies, such as those which the government has proposed, that would force us to look elsewhere for oil and gas and import them from jurisdictions that do not care about ethics, human rights, and the environment, or we could have the most ethically produced, environmentally friendly oil, from right here in Alberta.

              <ParaText id="6276924">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to reply to the Speech from the Throne. I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252987" Type="2">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276925">Today I speak in support of the throne speech, but not without reservations. Speaking frankly, my initial instinct and intention was to vote against the throne speech, given the ethical challenges of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276926">However, I cannot vote against it. This is because I have not heard from one constituent in my riding who says they want an election during a pandemic. I have heard this from not one constituent, regardless of political affiliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276927">Despite a growing dissatisfaction with the government's approach to governance and its respect for our institutions, there is a level of support at this time for continuity and non-partisanship in governments as we work together to take all necessary steps to confront the pandemic and its impact on our way of life. Fighting COVID-19 must be non-partisan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276928">There has been some higher degrees of co-operation and general agreement on programs that have been created to support the fight, and importantly, to support Canadians. We all know that at the appropriate and responsible time there will be an election. For now, let us lead as an effective and impactful minority Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276929">An election will happen, I presume, sometime after the second wave of COVID, and hopefully only after a vaccine has been widely administered. For now, Canadians want us all, and I mean us all, to remain focused on the job at hand, on public health and immediate economic needs, and to do so without mindless partisanship and unnecessary conflict. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276930">We all need to remain vigilant. Governments can only do so much. Individually, we need to be responsible and we must continue to follow all public health advice. There is little room for error. As are all members, I am guided by the people in my riding. Our constituency office has sought and received feedback on the issues that are most important to people during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276931">The top issue people shared is, not surprisingly, dealing with the immediate impact of COVID. Second are issues around finance and the economy, followed by the environment and housing. One message from my constituents, and in reply to the first part of the Speech from the Throne, is about addressing the immediate needs ahead of us. We must all ensure the programs we have put in place with such haste are in fact working, that the law and policy were right and, where these programs continue, they are sustainable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276932">This is not a question about austerity. It is a matter of good governance. As well, we need new metrics. If we are not just using debt-to-GDP, we need other fiscal anchors. Some specific issues raised by my constituents include a meaningful discussion and move toward a universal basic income, as well as investing in seniors, child care and pharmacare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276933">As to the balance of the Speech from the Throne, it was a shopping list of progressive policies and many long repeated and long outstanding promises. In the past, I was part of a government that had many of these same items on its shopping list. Often, as Canadians unfortunately have become used to, actions did not match the words when, ultimately, political expediency got in the way of progress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276934">Importantly, there are many people in groups talking about what our post-pandemic recovery should or should not look like. There is talk of a green recovery and a just recovery. These are important conversations we all must listen to. For any meaningful recovery to work, especially if it is to be transformative in addressing the broader challenges of our time, we need Parliament and all our institutions of government to be more effective and to work better. This is something the Speech from the Throne does not address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276935">As we have worked together in the face of the common threat of COVID-19, we have adapted. Parliament has adapted. As we move forward, and if we truly want to build back better, as the throne speech opines, then we need to think about the tools we have to build the nation we want and how our government works. If we can work together and change the way this place operates on the fly because of COVID-19, then surely we can make the deeper changes needed to make this place more effective, more accountable and a place where the voices of members of Parliament matter.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6276936">We also know from dealing with the pandemic that there are still deep-seated issues with the provinces concerning division of power, including, as has long been the case, health supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276937">In our young country, we have an evolving system of co-operative federalism. There is a role for the government and a role for the provinces and territories. If we truly want to build back better when the immediate threat is over, we must ensure that we have the right foundation to build on, one that includes indigenous nations and governments that are recognized and constituted as indigenous peoples determine. We should, at the very least, be open to a conversation about governance reform, including constitutional reform, the Senate, Quebec, indigenous peoples, the environment and making the federation better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276938">In addition to parliamentary reform, there is a need for electoral reform. There is also much work to do to address true reconciliation with indigenous peoples. Simply adopting UNDRIP and making some program enhancements, although they are important steps, are not enough. With strong governance, we will be better equipped to tackle the big issues of our day, the issues that will still be with us after COVID-19, such as climate change, the breakdown of the international rules-based order, or wealth and equality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276939">As we come out of this pandemic, we should start with our institutions and make building them better a priority. This will be tough, but Canadians have always been strong and resilient, and able to show governments the way forward. Collectively, we are only as strong and resilient as the institutions that support us, beyond party and politics. I was raised to always seek balance and where everyone in the community had a role to play. Rooted in these teachings is the importance of our interconnectedness, our responsibility to one another and to our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276940">Our collective way of being, indeed, our humanity, is being tested as we respond to COVID-19. We are in a learning moment. There is a reason some groups are being hit harder than others during the pandemic. It is because they are the vulnerable and the marginalized. The disproportionate impacts upon them are, in part, a reflection of endured injustices, and of a legacy of colonialism and systemic racism, which manifest themselves throughout society and our institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276941">More and more, I have been thinking about what it would be like if we had a society in which we truly recognized and supported one another, our fundamental unity and our diversity. This is not a new idea. If we are able to recognize it and do something about it during a pandemic, then why not permanently? If we can see it, but do not act on it now, then when will we?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276942">Moving forward, we need more than a shopping list of policy ideas. We need a vision and we need to establish clear priorities. We need political will and we need resolute action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276943">We also need a better way to measure our social well-being and our collective health. Today, we typically use GDP to make assumptions about social well-being and our standards of living. The assumption is that the higher per capita amount, the better the standards are. However, as an economic tool, GDP can only make assumptions about the basic standards of living, which can be different across the socio-economic spectrum of a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276944">COVID has highlighted how standards of living are different across communities. Moreover, our welfare is affected by other factors, such as mental well-being, cultural resilience and very importantly, environmental health, which are all things GDP does not consider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276945">What we need are better and more inclusive socio-economic factors. We need indicators that would help us to develop budgets that aim to increase the social well-being of Canadians, not just the economic bottom line. We need to plan based on what we truly value. When all human potential is maximized, our society will be truly transformed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276946">This is the core of my teachings, the teachings of my people, the Kwakwala, who have survived for millennia. This is the road to recovery. This is building back better. <I>Gilakas'la.</I></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6276960">There are a number of things in the Speech from the Throne that I am pleased to hear. In fact, there are some sections that sound a lot like the Green Party platform I ran on in 2015 and 2019. There are also sections that echo the Green Party's road map to economic recovery from the pandemic, “Reimagining Our Future”. What the throne speech is missing are plans for the bold actions in those documents. To quote our new Green Party leader Annamie Paul, platitudes are not a plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276961">We are facing two unprecedented crises: a global pandemic and a climate emergency. Both of these crises require that we listen to the scientists and the experts. Both of these crises require bold actions. The Speech from the Throne does not reflect the urgency of this moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276962">We keep hearing that we are all in this together, but this pandemic has laid bare the inequality in Canada. Those who have been affected by the pandemic are seniors, women, people of colour, indigenous people, people with disabilities and low-wage workers. At the same time, the wealthiest Canadians have been making money, hand over fist. The 20 richest people in Canada have increased their wealth by $37 billion during the six months of this pandemic. It is time for a wealth tax in this country. It is time for the wealthy to pay their fair share for the public services their businesses and employees rely on. It is time that the Internet giants and multinational corporations that do business in Canada pay their fair share of taxes as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276963">Small and medium-sized Canadian enterprises are suffering from the economic fallout of the pandemic. In particular, the travel, tourism, hospitality and entertainment sectors need additional help so that these businesses can survive. The non-profit sector provides vital services to Canadians, especially right now. This sector needs additional targeted support as well. Small and medium-sized businesses are the engine of the Canadian economy and employ almost 90% of the private sector workers in this country. These businesses need support to get through the second wave of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276964">We need to do a better job of taking care of each other. We are the only country in the world with universal health care but no universal pharmacare. It is mentioned in the throne speech, but we have heard it before and we have not seen a plan. Universal pharmacare would save billions in unnecessary health care costs by ensuring people have the medicines they need. We need a universal dental program to complete our universal health care system. This too would save billions in unnecessary health care costs. A $90 filling today can save $10,000 in a heart operation down the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276965">Our recovery must focus on supporting women and families. Canada urgently needs a universal child care program to enable more women to return to the workplace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276966">Thousands of people across this country are homeless or at risk of homelessness. It is more important than ever that the federal government invest in affordable housing, in particular community-owned co-operative housing. The announcements on housing programs sound good, but the funding needs to flow right away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276967">We have an opioid crisis in this country. Thousands of people have died from drug poisonings. Addiction is a health and social issue. Our public health officers are telling us to follow evidence-based solutions to this crisis. We need to listen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276968"> We need a national mental health strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276969"> The Green Party has long been calling for a national strategy for seniors, including national standards for long-term care and additional supports for home care so that people can age in place. Seniors deserve a top-up of OAS and GIS to help make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276970">Many people with disabilities have been waiting for long periods of time for the benefits and protections that they need. The COVID-19 one-time support payment for people with disabilities was announced three months into the pandemic. It is now almost four months later and nobody has received a cheque. I understand those cheques are supposed to be sent at the end of this month. People with disabilities are sick of waiting and sick of being left behind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6276971">Veterans Affairs Canada had a backlog of almost 50,000 disability benefit applications as of March 2020. It will take three years to clear that backlog with the current resource levels. Veterans deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276972">Young people and students are not mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. The Green Party has been advocating for the elimination of tuition fees so that we can create an educated workforce without burdening our young people with unsustainable debt. Northern European countries all have free tuition. It is a matter of priorities. Let us prioritize our young people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276973">The Canada student service grant was a very bad idea from the beginning, and we know how that turned out. Those funds should have gone into the Canada summer jobs program to help youth and non-profits get through the pandemic. Canada summer jobs was underfunded. In my riding of Nanaimo—Ladysmith alone, there was 500,000 dollars' worth of unfunded applications. We need to bring our social programs in line with the northern European countries, where citizens have a real social safety net from cradle to grave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276974">The biggest opportunity that the government has missed in the Speech from the Throne is a guaranteed livable income. Our current patchwork of social programs allows too many people to fall through the cracks. A guaranteed livable income would create an income floor, under which no Canadian would fall. It would eliminate extreme poverty in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276975">I can hear the objections now. How are we going to pay for all of this? Let us go back to where I began. Canada needs a wealth tax. We need to close tax loopholes that allow people and corporations to avoid taxes in Canada and offshore their wealth. It is worth emphasizing that the costs of social inequality are far greater than the costs of taking care of people to start with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276976">Let us use this resource wealth we have to create maximum employment and benefits for Canadians, starting with first nations and indigenous peoples, who are the rightful owners of those resources. We need to implement all of the recommendations in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. It is time to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276977">We also need electoral reform. It was not mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, and that is no surprise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276978">There are good things in the speech, and there are a lot of things missing or things that need to be improved on, but the bottom line is that there is no real plan to do our part to stop our own destructive practices that are wiping out the biodiversity on this planet, destroying our climate and threatening the future of our children and grandchildren. We still have the climate targets set by Stephen Harper's Conservative government, pathetic and inadequate targets, and there is no plan to even reach those pathetic and inadequate targets. Since the first climate conference in Geneva in 1979, successive Canadian governments have been well aware of climate change. Only one government actually bothered to establish a plan to meet the targets that they agreed to. That was the Paul Martin government, which was brought down by the Conservatives and the NDP before those plans could be implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276979">Britain has set a carbon budget in law. It set plans and holds to those carbon budget targets, independent of the toxic partisan politics that dominate our electoral system. The U.K. has reduced its emissions by 42% below 1990 levels, while Canada has increased emissions by 21% since 1990. Canada is a climate do-nothing. I will not vote for a Speech from the Throne that does not include the targets that science demands and a real plan of action to meet those targets and address the crisis we are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276980">My work here is not to ensure that I get re-elected. My work here is not to boost the fortunes of the Green Party. My work here is not to play a game of partisan politics. My work and role here is to push the government as hard as I can to do the right thing, to improve the lives of Canadians and take real action on climate change. We owe our children and grandchildren nothing less than the full defence of their future on this planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276981">There are other members of other parties who know this to be true. I want them to know that their work here is to fight for the existence of humanity. Their party bosses and big donors may be interested in making the last chunk of money from fracking, but they need to question what their purpose is on this planet at this time, in this place. Members should think about those moments in their childhood when they saw a world full of wonder and possibility. We in the House have the power to make decisions that count, decisions that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276982">This is our time to meet the challenge of our time. The Speech from the Throne does not meet the challenge. It is time to do better. I will be voting “no”.</ParaText>

A year ago, I never really thought I would be in my home office in Mary's Harbour in rural northern Canada, in the wonderful riding of Labrador, or in any other community, logging in to the House of Commons to participate in parliamentary debates and votes. From that perspective, I think we have done well as a Parliament to ensure that parliamentarians' voices are being heard and that there is full participation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276998">In spite of COVID-19 and its horrible impact on people's lives, with the wake of tragedy and devastation that it has left for so many families, it has prompted a renewed defence in protecting our health, communities and country. We have all been forced to become more self-sufficient and resilient in the fight against COVID-19. It has also brought many of us together as Canadians and allowed us to comfort each other while modernizing the future for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6276999">The Speech from the Throne is being debated today in the House of Commons. There are many, on certain sides of the House, who really believe that the Government of Canada is not going far enough in our programs and support for Canadians. There are others who feel we have gone way too far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277000">I believe we have been fair and responsible in looking after Canadians at a time when they have needed it most. I really believe that our government has set out priorities that not only will assist Canadians today as we make our way through this pandemic, but will allow us to assist Canadians into the future and allow Canadians to move forward. In these uncertain and unprecedented times, there is no blueprint for what we are dealing with today in this country. There is no blueprint to show us a direction for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277001">Our government has listened to Canadians. We have been attentive and focused, and we have been listening to what our constituents are telling us. We know we must have a strong defence to protect our health and help Canadians, not just in weathering the pandemic, but also in weathering that which lays ahead in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277002">We are doing that by providing for the supports they need now and by laying down a concrete plan to build back better after this is over. We know that we must bridge the social and economic gaps that this pandemic has shown us. For many marginal groups, such as women, northerners, indigenous and rural Canadians, to name just a few, we know that those economic gaps have been glaring. We know that more is required if we are to build back better and address those particular gaps in society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277003">From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, cabinet and all MPs have been out there supporting Canadians who needed it most. This was done through the Canada emergency response benefit, for example. Because of it, over nine million Canadians were able to weather the financial hardship that was brought on by this pandemic. Many of my own constituents would not have come through these last number of months, some with even a roof over their heads, without the Canada emergency response benefit, so I know personally and first-hand from my own constituents how much this program benefited them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277004">We increased funding to the new horizons for seniors program, which helped deliver essential services and goods to the elderly in isolation and helped them improve their community supports.

              <ParaText id="6277006">In fact, we have invested in every women's shelter and food bank across Labrador, in both indigenous and non-indigenous communities, and we did that because we knew the demand was there. We knew there was a gap and it was evident that support from the federal government was going to assist those who were most vulnerable. We knew it was imperative for our government to act and, therefore, we acted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277008">Since March, our government has listened to the advice of Canada's top health and science professionals and we knew it was important that we follow direction from the experts among us. We needed to ensure that our heroic front-line workers were provided with the necessary equipment they needed to do their jobs and provide all Canadians with the most up-to-date information on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and support residents during this difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277009">We have made tremendous progress as a country already. We are already more resilient in our personal protective equipment and the manufacturing that goes with it.

This pandemic brought out the resilience in both individuals and businesses to fight this pandemic together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277010">As a government, we implemented historic economic and social programs to financially support individual Canadians and businesses across the country. We know that, in many ridings, Canadians would have lost their homes or businesses. There are still some who may lose those important assets that are essential to their lives, along with losing their jobs. However, we know that without the federal government stepping up with the supports that it has, it could have been a lot more drastic.

              <ParaText id="6277012">Not only that, our government worked hard. We worked with provinces and territories to fund wage top-ups for front-line workers. I think about all of the workers out there today who kept their doors open while we stayed home to stop the spread of this virus. They continued to work hard every day in the midst of a pandemic to ensure that there was first response, there were essential health care services and there was food security for those who needed it. Many caregivers worked on the front lines and in seniors homes. We will be forever grateful for the work they do and that they braved this pandemic to provide the services that so many Canadians were dependent upon.

              <ParaText id="6277015">In this pandemic, we also recognized the disparity that exists in food security and medical care in northern, Inuit, indigenous, first nations and Métis communities across Canada. We invested millions of dollars in the distinctions-based indigenous community support fund. We know that, without it, indigenous communities across Canada would have been left very ill-prepared to fight this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277016">We invested in first-time subsidies to help with heating costs, preparing emergency shelters and medical preparedness plans in case of an outbreak in indigenous communities in northern regions.

              <ParaText id="6277030">Madam Speaker, before the pandemic many Canadians were voicing their need for affordable and accessible child care. In fact, the Comox Valley Chamber of Commerce said it is its number one issue. The Liberals have been promising child care for 20 years, in fact, children who needed child care 20 years ago are needing child care now. This summer when the Liberals had the opportunity to invest in child care with transfers to the provinces, they refused to do what was needed. Parents, especially women who want to work outside the home, want to get back to work, but they do not have a safe place to send their kids.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277031"> We are fighting for safe, affordable child care. The Province of B.C. has been investing in child care. It needs a federal partner, a champion. I am asking the member: When will this happen? We cannot wait another 20 years. Does the member agree that this is not just a social issue, but a very important economic issue? We saw the success of the program implemented in Quebec. It grew the GDP, 70,000 people went back to work and most of them were women. This is the time to implement such a program as we recover from the pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277033">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise virtually in the House of Commons this morning on behalf of my constituents here on Treaty 1 territory, the homeland of the Métis nation, to highlight the many commitments our government has made to support Canadians as we continue to fight against COVID-19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277034">Our government knew that we needed to provide immediate support to Canadians as our country grappled with the most serious public health crisis and economic crisis of our lifetime. Within a matter of weeks, our government introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, the CERB, which provided direct and immediate income support of $2,000 per month to those who had suddenly lost their jobs. The CERB provided over 277,000 Manitobans with money so that they could make their rent or mortgage payments and put food on the table. Now, as we transition away from CERB, our government continues to support Canadians with an improved EI benefit that provides $500 per week for those who continue to look for work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277035">Canadians should not have to choose between their livelihoods and their health, and that is why we introduced a national sick leave benefit. We also announced a caregiver benefit for parents who need to take time off to care for a child or a loved one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277036">I know that these benefits have been absolutely critical to many families in my communities. I know many parents have had to make difficult decisions regarding their employment, and women in particular have faced the brunt of these difficult choices. The numbers we have seen are shocking. Women's participation in the workforce has dropped to levels we have not seen since the 1980s. Canada's economic recovery will not be complete without a strong return to work for women across the country. To achieve this, we have committed to a national child care strategy so that parents will have access to quality, accessible and affordable child care as they return to their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277037">During this difficult time, many of my constituents have emailed, phoned and sent letters regarding key policies they wished to see in the Speech from the Throne. Thanks to their thoughtful feedback, our government has made strong commitments to establishing national pharmacare, increasing old age security, supporting family reunification and many important initiatives that would have a significant and positive impact here in Manitoba and across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277038">I know that all members of the House will agree when I say that Canadians have truly risen to the occasion and supported one another in amazing ways in the last six months, and Manitobans are no exception. Let me take this moment to recognize the selfless efforts of our front-line health care workers in Manitoba, who have worked tirelessly under the most difficult of circumstances. I also want to recognize essential workers, such as our truck drivers and grocery store clerks, who have stepped up when we needed them most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277039">I want to take a moment to give a special mention to the folks at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. It has been at the forefront of incredibly important work to protect the health of Canadians, including developing the first Canadian COVID test on January 15, providing testing regimes for remote northern communities, and conducting essential research support for vaccine and therapeutic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277040">We have often heard the proverb that it takes a village. During COVID, we have seen it come to life in my community of Winnipeg South. Mosques, churches, temples and local organizations here have exemplified what it means to be a community and have come together to take care of those most in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277041">We know that the devastation facing our small-businesses community has been among the biggest challenges our country has faced through this pandemic. Small businesses are the backbone of the Manitoba economy, providing thousands of jobs in every corner of the province. Our government recognizes this, and has committed to supporting SMEs through a number of initiatives. Early on, we provided the emergency wage subsidy, which covered 75% of a worker's wages so that businesses could continue to keep their employees on the payroll. Not only have we made this program more flexible, we have also announced that we will be extending it to next summer so that businesses can plan ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277042">Other federal support programs have also been critical to the vitality of our businesses, including the Canada emergency business account loan program, which has provided $40,000 in interest-free loans to qualifying businesses to help them bridge to the other side of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277043">For businesses that have been unable to access these programs, Western Economic Diversification and our regional development agencies across Canada have been critical in helping us provide direct support to SMEs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277044">In May, the government earmarked approximately $1 billion to the regional relief and recovery fund, RRRF, which was designed specifically to aid small businesses that may have fallen through the cracks and were unable to access other business programs. In my home province of Manitoba, the RRRF has supported 85 different businesses, with a total funding of over $8.4 million. Just last week, our <Affiliation DbId="253380" Type="4">Minister of Economic Development</Affiliation> announced an additional investment of $600 million to the regional relief and recovery program so we can continue to support small businesses and help them weather this time of economic uncertainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277045">This is a very difficult time for so many, and our priority remains protecting people and saving lives. At the same time, we cannot forget that when it comes to protecting people there is another crisis on the horizon that will create even more health and economic disruption than COVID-19. I am, of course, speaking of the climate crisis. Nowhere is the climate crisis felt more strongly than in the disruptions to our water cycle and our freshwater systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277046">Decades of public opinion surveys record that Canadians feel no resource is more important than fresh, clean water to our economy, health and well-being. I am delighted the Government of Canada cemented its commitment, in the Speech from the Throne, to create a Canada Water Agency to work with provinces, territories, municipalities, indigenous governments and stakeholders to better manage and protect our precious freshwater resources. I am especially pleased and honoured that the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> has asked me to lead this effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277047">As Canadians, we are fortunate to have over two million lakes and rivers: approximately 20% of the world's freshwater. Our waterways support fisheries, tourism, shipping and navigation, and so many other industries. They are crucial for aquatic ecosystems and wetland habitats, which are vital for many plants and animals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277048">An important part of keeping our freshwater resources protected and well managed includes improving deteriorating water quality. To this end, in 2017 we invested $70.5 million in the Great Lakes and the Lake Winnipeg basin. Over five years, $44.84 million was provided to the Great Lakes protection initiative in order to address the most significant environmental challenges affecting the Great Lakes: water quality and ecosystem health. For the Lake Winnipeg basin, $25.8 million was allocated to address the increasing challenge of nutrient pollution and toxic algae in restoring the health of Canada's sixth great lake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277049">In this era of climate instability, flooding has had a major impact on communities and the public treasury. The government has paid out more in disaster assistance in the last 10 years than in the last 40 years. The Manitoba flood of 2011 alone saw more than 7,000 people displaced from their homes, critical infrastructure destroyed, and 70 states of emergency declared in local communities, resulting in a $1-billion impact to the Manitoba economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277050">To address these flooding and water challenges, the Speech from the Throne commits the Government of Canada to make investments in the Canada Water Agency, as well as in major water infrastructure to better manage and protect our waterways for the benefit of the environment, the economy and future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277051">Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has been the most serious health and economic crisis our community has faced in generations. In Manitoba, as well as in communities across the country, we have seen Canadians come together and work together in extraordinary ways to help one another through these difficult times. There has been unprecedented co-operation among the provinces, territories and the federal government. Canadians want to see that co-operation continue, and they want to see all parties in the House work together to help meet the challenge of COVID-19 and build a better Canada when the pandemic subsides. Let us not disappoint them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277059">I want to start by acknowledging how very challenging these last seven months have been for so many. I look at the people working in the hospitals and long-term care facilities and front-line workers everywhere, including people delivering groceries. It has been seven months and it has not been getting any easier for many of them. We know they are getting tired and we want to express our immense appreciation for what they are doing. I also want to recognize that many individuals and businesses also continue to face extraordinary challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277060">Regardless of the disagreements we might have in the House, I think it is fair to say that we are united in the agreement that we must do the best we can to support Canadians during this time. In these unprecedented times, it is healthy to have vigorous debate and at times disagreements on the best path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277061">About one year ago, we were on the campaign trail. Just a few short weeks later, the current government was given a new mandate by the people. It was a minority mandate, because the Canadian public did not have quite as much faith in the Liberals as they had in the previous election. There was an important message in that election for the Liberal government to hear, but I am not sure the Liberals heard it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277062">Since that time, we have had two Speeches from the Throne, but we have had no budget. We have had over 80-plus days of the morning show on the Rideau porch. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would come out on his porch and announce spending and extraordinary new measures. During that same time, we had 14 sitting days in the House. Let us think about that. We had a Prime Minister announcing extraordinary new programs during an unprecedented crisis and we had only 14 sitting days. The bottom line is that we heard about billions and billions of dollars, with very minimal debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277063">That is how mistakes get made. By bypassing Parliament, committees and process, the Liberals will make mistakes. That is why things like the loan program for businesses was such a disaster. The Liberals did not look to the brainpower, to the people and the experience within the Parliament, to take that extra bit of time needed to do things properly. That is on the government. It was 80 days of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on the porch and 14 days in Parliament with minimal debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277064">I went back to read a number of Speeches from the Throne as part of my process of thinking about what I would say today. I went back to 2008 and 2011 and I saw very workmanlike speeches. They were very orderly, workmanlike, telling Canadians what the vision and goals of the government were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277065">Then I went to the Speech from the Throne in 2015 from the current Liberal government. What it said was that the Government of Canada “will promote more open debate and free votes, and reform and strengthen committees.” Right now a committee is looking into some challenges of the current government, the WE scandal, and the government is doing its very best to shut that committee down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277066">That speech also said, “notable are the things the government will not do....it will not resort to devices like prorogation and omnibus bills to avoid scrutiny.” What did the Liberal government do in the middle of a crisis? It prorogued. No one believes it was anything other than to avoid the WE scandal and further testimony about how the government was helping Liberal friends in this time of crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277067"> I found it absolutely stunning that when we finally came back after the prorogation period, we had a fast-tracked bill. Again, there was no committee debate. Was this 2015 promise just for 2015 when the Liberals had a majority or was it a promise for what the Liberal government wanted to do?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277068">However, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> had the nerve to say to the media that we had to fast-track the bill because we had to get help to Canadians. I remember reading this and thinking about fast-tracking the bill. We had five weeks in which we were ready, willing, able and we would have done anything to do proper scrutiny of the bill to ensure it was done right so we would not be in the same position we are with the bills we have seen, such as the rent assistance program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277069">They did indicate that they wanted to trust their government. The Liberals say that they want Canadians to trust them. I do not know about other members, but as we hit ethical scandal after ethical scandal, I think that trust is eroding in many ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277070">I did not mention democratic reform, but that again was a strong commitment by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277071">After reading this Speech from the Throne, I am left with some doubt on whether the Liberals will do what they say they will do. They have a propensity to recycle their broken promises. Their promise on child care goes back 20 years, which is an awful long time. Their promise on pharmacare has been there for a while. The Speech from the Throne focused a little on the current issue and a whole lot on recycled, broken promises. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277072">On what is most important to Canadians right now, the Liberals have said that their number one pillar is to fight the pandemic and save lives. I think everyone in the House can agree with that, but we have to look at the execution of this. Who sent all our PPE equipment either to the dumpster or to China? Who failed to keep our stockpile up to snuff? Who failed to look at what other countries were doing with respect to rapid testing? Who failed to close the borders in an appropriate time and accused the opposition of being racist by suggesting we should close the borders? It was the government. However, we need to look forward now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277073">We now know that everyone expected a second wave would come. We knew that there was a bit of a window to prepare for that. What did the Liberals do about fighting this pandemic and saving lives?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277074"> The Liberals will set national standards for seniors, because those are the people who have been most impacted. A recent article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal talked about the issues with seniors, and standards were not one of those issues. They were issues of ensuring protective equipment, training personnel, licencing inspections and capital improvements. Those things would prevent issues in a second wave. Did the government make a move? I know it is the responsibility of provinces and territories, but did the Liberals say to the provinces and territories that a second wave was coming, that they wanted to support them, what could they do to help, was it just about money or were there other things they could do to help? If a second wave hits these seniors homes, part of it is on the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277075">For indigenous people, they were very specific 10 months ago. The Liberals would eliminate all long-term drinking water advisories on reserve by 2021. In the speech, they say they will make additional resiliency investments. What does that mean? I think most first nations know what eliminating all long-term drinking water advisories means, but do they know what additional resiliency investments are? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277076">I find much to be concerned about with the government's current approach. Certainly, from our side, we would have great difficulty supporting this Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>

Canadians do have a very different expectation and the government has risen to that, which is to work more with opposition parties. In fact, anything and everything that passes through the House now requires that support and we continuously reach out for it. Even the throne speech will have the support of at least one other political party in the House, otherwise it would not pass. It is the same thing with legislation. Canadians also sent a message to the Conservative Party, one of co-operation. What we have witnessed over the last couple of months from the opposition party is anything but co-operation. Those members seem to want a dysfunctional House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252619" Type="2">Hon. Steven Blaney (Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6277092">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate virtually today. I would like to take this opportunity to say hello to my House of Commons colleagues and everyone following our proceedings. I would like to point out that I am taking part in today's proceedings from the city of Lévis, which is currently in a red zone. I want to commend the resilience of the people of Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis who are experiencing the strains of the lockdown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277093">The purpose of my intervention today is to convey that I cannot support the Speech from the Throne delivered by the Governor General on September 23, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277094">The role of government and of parliamentarians is to help and support people, to minimize the impacts of the pandemic and to try to make things run smoothly. I simply cannot support the throne speech because there are two fundamental components missing from it, things that would help people in red zones, like the people of Lévis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277095">Measures need to be put in place immediately to deal with the resurgence of the pandemic. That includes quicker testing and results analysis. For example, the wife of one of my colleagues who works in the education system was tested for COVID-19 and has been waiting for three days now for her results, which means that my colleague also has to wait for the results. That is paralyzing the work of our organizations, despite telework being an option. It slows things down, not to mention the fact that some jobs require staff to be on site.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277096">In our region, there are a lot of manufacturing jobs. These measures are needed immediately to support public health authorities in order to make testing faster, something that is not clearly set out in the throne speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277097">Another necessary measure involves providing reasonable and targeted support to businesses and individuals during the pandemic so that the government remains agile and flexible once it is over. Unfortunately, even before the pandemic, the Liberals were already caught in a deficit spiral. Right now we are far from improving our situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277098">What is in a throne speech? As my colleague from British Columbia mentioned, we usually expect a throne speech to present a vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277099">This vision could have explained how to fight the pandemic and help people right now while presenting a plan for the medium term. However, neither of these elements is in the throne speech. On the contrary, it is chock full of all kinds of promises. Having many priorities means that there are none. It is just a jumble of words. Unfortunately, this does not meet our immediate needs as the pandemic surges and we are experiencing a second wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277100">In my view, the best analysis of the throne speech is the one provided by the Parliamentary Budget Officer. His analysis leads us to conclude that the throne speech is not what Canada needs right now to face the pandemic. We should remember that the Parliamentary Budget Officer is an independent officer and he is in some ways the government watchdog. He is there to remind the government that it must stay on track if it wants to prevent problems from arising further down the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277101">We have seen the warning signs. Before the throne speech, my old colleague and former finance minister, Joe Oliver, said that it is time for Canada to pick a fiscal anchor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277102">Of course we need to support people. In 2008, the Conservatives did that through massive infrastructure investments to stimulate the economy. Many projects got built in my riding, including the Lac-Etchemin arena, the Lévis water treatment plant and the Notre-Dame-Auxiliatrice-de-Buckland infrastructure project. Those were measurable outcomes of targeted investments, and the Conservatives also had a plan at the time to balance the budget.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277103">A former Liberal finance minister, John Manley, said it is important to have a fiscal anchor because that shows the financial markets that Canada is supporting people and knows where it is going in the medium term. Unfortunately, the throne speech proves that this government is going in the opposite direction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277104">According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's economic outlook, it is possible to get through the pandemic and stay on track with realistic fiscal anchors, but that will not be possible if the government engages in new spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277105">As my colleague from British Columbia said, the Liberals are interfering in programs that are provincial responsibilities. As the saying goes, they are throwing money out the window. That is not the sound management we expect. Moreover, financial markets are worried. Firms such as Fitch Ratings have downgraded Canada, and credit rating agencies such as Bloomberg and Moody's have warned Canada that if it does not stop spending shamelessly and keeps introducing poorly targeted measures, it is going to crash and burn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277106">We want to support Canadians, but we want to be able to do that now and in the long term. The measures proposed by the Liberals combined with the government's extravagant spending would threaten the social safety net in the medium term. That is troubling. We are not even close to achieving sustainable development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277107"> According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, there is a risk that the sustainable debt-to-GDP trajectory could be reversed. In other words, if we continue to spend excessively on extravagant and poorly targeted measures, we will be temporarily “doped” by a significant cash injection, but we will have to pay for the damage in the medium and long term, since this is borrowed money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277108">There is another aspect that concerns me. The Speech from the Throne says that interest rates are going to stay low for decades to come. Of course that is unrealistic. The Bank of Canada's key interest rate is currently 0.25%. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's assumption, that rate could remain stable for the next three years, but it is expected to increase by 1% within five years' time. That is five times higher than the current key rate. The rate would remain fixed at 1.25%, but that would still increase the debt by $8 billion. The government seems to be deluding itself regarding easy credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277109"> The third thing that worries me is the government's poorly targeted measures. People received more money than they lost from their savings. This is borrowed money, though. It belongs to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277110">Canadians' household income went up by 5.4%. That is nice to see, but since this is borrowed money, it will have to be paid back. The problem is that the Liberal government makes poor spending choices and implements measures that hurt the economy. For example, it did not encourage people to stay connected to their jobs or to return to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277111">I will not support the throne speech because it contains extravagant expenses, is devoid of any fiscal anchors and does not present short-term measures to combat the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277112">In conclusion, I would like to thank the Chair for coordinating the hybrid sitting. This is the first time I have participated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277113">I will now yield the floor to my colleagues and I would be happy to take questions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277131">I feel the federal government has done an excellent job of meeting the specific needs of all communities, especially those of my riding of Egmont.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6277132">I am impressed with the four foundations of the government's plan. Of course, we must fight the pandemic and protect the health and safety of all Canadians. Second, we have been on a consistent course of supporting the values of reconciliation, equality and the fight against systemic racism. Third, our immediate effort is to help Canadians through this difficult time. As I have heard from many people in my constituency of Egmont, there is an appreciation and respect for government's rapid and effective decision-making. Government responded in a way that was reliable and it built confidence in our country. Across my community, individuals and businesses feel they are supported and respected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277133">I think Canadians know that the government respects all communities and understands the needs of every individual.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6277134">While concerns certainly remain, there is a great sense that government will do everything in its power to protect the interests of every Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277135">Finally, the fundamental goal of creating jobs and continuing our support for the middle class truly looks forward. We need that aspirational language. We need to put together the constructive framework for future success and we need to provide a clear pathway toward better days ahead. In my opinion, government is meeting that test of leadership. Furthermore, I believe government has achieved its leadership role in partnership with individuals and communities. We have not worked in a top-down manner. Instead we have listened to Canadians. Thanks to the hard work of thousands of Egmont residents, we are building a stronger economy that benefits everyone. As a result, the people of my community have told me they believe they have a share in the community's progress. They believe that we are all in this together and will share the challenges and the opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277136">I want to thank all those in Egmont who reached out with clear, articulate ideas to move our community forward even in the context of our greatest crisis since the Second World War. In the largest sense, government has done well for the past five years to accentuate a spirit of partnership with Canadians. In my opinion, I believe that community partnerships that emphasize job growth through infrastructure is the best road forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277137">In Egmont, that forward-looking plan is helping to build one of the greenest communities in Canada. Our leadership role in renewable energy is well recognized across Canada. For decades, Egmont has adopted an approach that accentuates advances in wind power and now there are new projects that build on the promise of solar energy. The key part of these efforts is government is providing its expertise and investments in a way that benefits an entire community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277138">We all have the opportunity to share in Egmont's environmental progress. As we emerge from the current crisis, we will be in a tremendous position to take advantage of the world's changing energy demands. We are building, and we are building stronger and smarter. For that reason, I was very happy to see references in the throne speech to an Atlantic energy loop. For years, Atlantic Canada has worked on plans to co-operate on energy initiatives. The support signalled in the throne speech reflects my hope for an eastern partnership that permits freer flow of energy resources while rewarding hard-won advances in technological innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277139">From the perspective of individuals and families, I am also pleased to see further evidence of the government's ability to focus on people. During the spring, we were all deeply concerned about the effects of the pandemic on long-term care facilities. Mercifully, there were no outbreaks on Prince Edward Island, but every Islander shared in the pain and distress experienced across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277140">For that reason, I am very pleased to say that we will be working on national standards for long-term care, which will protect thousands of Canadians and build confidence in our systems. To achieve that confidence-building goal, we will need to work with our provincial partners and provide the resources needed to create safe and welcoming places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277141">Additionally, I am extremely pleased to see that we will embark in a new direction when it comes to disability supports. A program modelled after the guaranteed income supplement for seniors will make a tremendous difference in the lives of many people in my community. I look forward to the day that we make this commitment a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277142">In some ways that promise reminds me of the government's decision to reverse the decision by the former administration to push the retirement age to 67. Personally, I know many people who have worked more than 40 years and are looking forward to retirement at age 65. To move those goalposts was unfair. I want to commend the government once again for reversing that unfortunate agenda. Again, that is why I am proud to be a part of this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277143">The Speech from the Throne does not pick winners and losers. It does not favour one group over another. Instead, we are following a path that tailors itself to the needs of individuals, families and communities. We are not about the broad, sweeping generalizations of the past government, rather this is a government that embraces unique challenges faced by every Canadian in a way that responds to specific needs and recognizes opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277144">Along those lines I also want to congratulate the government on its rapid and effective response to COVID. All of us remember the difficult days of March and April when there was so much uncertainty and concern. Programs were designed that almost immediately addressed those worries and built a relationship of trust and confidence between the federal government and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277145">I admit that I was worried. I was concerned that the crisis was too big, that we would miss people and lose sight of communities, but we did not. We succeeded because this government has an understanding of the uniqueness of every individual and every community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277146">In closing, I would like to encourage the government to maintain that path, to remain vigilant about the concerns of the kitchen table and the need to build a stronger national economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277147">I want to thank all the residents of my community for their hard work, creativity and willingness to build a stronger community.</ParaText>

I also want to thank him for voting in favour of my unanimous motion to tackle ocean plastics. One part of that motion deals with ghost and derelict fishing gear. We were glad to see the government commit $8.6 million to dealing with the cleanup of that abandoned and derelict fishing gear, but it is literally a drop in the bucket. It is not the only solution. We need a polluter-pays model with tracking, marked gear, regulations, monitoring, better accountability and enforcement if we are really going to tackle this issue. Washington and Oregon have done a great job. The Global Ghost Gear Initiative has made many recommendations to the current government, but when it comes to the Speech from the Throne, it barely mentions oceans. It talks about a blue economy and our oceans protection.</ParaText>

We can listen to the rhetoric that we hear day after day coming from across the floor or we can look at the actual practice of Conservative governments. We have had two in the past, one in the late eighties that racked up the biggest deficit at the time in the history of the country when facing no extraordinary measures. Therefore, it is a bit ironic for the Conservative Party to lecture this government on balancing books when it barely did it on one minor occasion in about 20 years of governing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277163">I would like to acknowledge we are gathered on the ancestral land of the Mississaugas of the New Credit.</ParaText>

In no particular order, they include Canadians from all walks of life: personal support workers, police, bus drivers, military personnel, pharmacists, supermarket workers, nurses, doctors, drivers, public servants, waste-removal people, construction workers, cleaners, security guards, support staff, postal workers, our teachers and thousands more.

              <ParaText id="6277165">The war against this invisible enemy has truly been a team Canada effort to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to support workers and businesses. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have put Canadians first. The way our Liberal government, led by our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has collaborated and consulted with our partners, including the provinces, territories, municipal governments, labour, businesses, not-for-profit agencies, scientists, public health authorities and so many other stakeholders, has been essential to the successes we have had in our fight against the coronavirus. As was crystal clear in the Speech from the Throne, for our Liberal government, support for our workers and families is paramount. The health and safety of our workers and the recovery of our economy remain our government's top priorities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277166">I need to address what I feel in my heart of hearts was the saddest and most tragic aspect of this pandemic. COVID-19 has exposed significant ugly weaknesses in our health care system. Of all of Canada's deaths related to COVID-19, a staggering 85% have occurred in long-term care homes. Now with the second wave, we must do more to protect our most vulnerable. Our hearts go out to all those who have passed away from this terrible virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277167"> Many seniors from my riding were residents of Camilla Care long-term care home. Tragically, Camilla Care lost over 70 residents to coronavirus. The reports of understaffing, COVID-positive residents sharing rooms with residents who were COVID negative and a lack of basic care, including feeding, toileting and dressing, are unacceptable and cannot happen again. I heard from families, friends and loved ones who could not see or speak with their dying parents. They will live with these painful memories forever. The lives lost in long-term care homes to COVID is one of Canada’s greatest tragedies. Vulnerable seniors deserve to be safe, to be respected and to live with dignity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277168">Although long-term care falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government will take any action it can to support seniors while working alongside our provinces and territories. Canadians stand strong with us on this righteous cause. A recent survey showed 88% of Canadians agree that there is a need to implement extensive social and health programs to help and protect our seniors and most vulnerable citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277169">The Liberal government will work with Parliament on Criminal Code amendments to explicitly penalize those who neglect seniors under their care, putting them in danger. The Liberal government will also work with the provinces and territories to set new national standards for long-term care so that seniors get the best support possible, and take additional action to help people stay in their homes longer. Let us all thank the members of the Canadian Forces who were there in long-term care homes and shined a light on the neglect. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277171">The Speech from the Throne addresses gaps in our social system. The pandemic has underscored the inseparability of Canada’s economic, health and social well-being. Our sound recovery will address these stark gaps in our social safety net and ensure that the most vulnerable communities are not left behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277172">The government has pledged support, taken action and will continue to work with further targeted measures for personal support workers; help for vulnerable communities; support for the disabled; increased flexibility of systems to reach people at home, i.e., like we are doing here virtually; and the accelerated development of a universal pharmacare program. We will support our communities, investing in all types of infrastructure, including public transit, energy-efficient retrofits, clean energy and affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277173">The throne speech is a plan for a stronger and more resilient Canada. I can say unequivocally to workers in my community and across our country that if they have lost their jobs, we have their backs. Since March 15, almost nine million people have received the Canada emergency response benefit, also known as the CERB, helping millions of Canadians and their families avoid catastrophic household income loss while, at the same time, helping to keep our economy strong. People are still living in uncertain times and the government will continue to be there for them. So many residents in my area have emailed, written and called me just to say what these concrete investments have meant to them, and the financial stress and strain they have alleviated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277174">We are shoring up our employment insurance system. The government has created a transitional Canada response benefit to help Canadians transition from the CERB to the employment insurance system, which will be revamped to include self-employed individuals and those in the gig economy. A more flexible EI program, paid sick leave and a caregiver benefit will allow us to continue helping Canadians and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277175">The government will do whatever it takes and use whatever fiscal firepower to support people and the businesses that employ them. I have worked closely with the Mississauga Board of Trade and the many businesses that have been impacted negatively by this pandemic. I can think of no greater shock to a business than to have to stop cold, through no fault of their own, and live with the uncertainty of when things will get better or start to normalize. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277176">I have reached out to small businesses to identify needs and facilitate access to programs, such as the Canada emergency business account and the Canada emergency wage subsidy. These and other programs were greatly appreciated in my riding and the government's commitment to extending these programs is welcome. The wage subsidy program has literally saved tens of thousands of jobs and has prevented many businesses in Mississauga East and across Canada from going bankrupt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277177">The Liberal government will take the following steps to support struggling businesses. It will extend the wage subsidy into the summer of 2021, expand the Canada emergency business account, improve the business credit availability and introduce support for industries that have been hardest hit, like travel, tourism and hospitality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277178">In conclusion, the throne speech reflects our government's road map to manage the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the role that Canada will play in a world that has likely changed forever. When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country, I know we are already building back better. We are and will be more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and sharing. However, for now, we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives. </ParaText>

The government has always been there, every step of the way, working together with our provinces and territories to find ways to provide better health care. We did it with mental health services and home care services in previous budgets. We will continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277189">During this pandemic, we did it by deploying our military to help in our long-term care homes that were hardest hit. We will continue. We want a universal pharmacare program for our nation. We will continue to make this one of the strongest values in Canada, working with our partners, the provinces, and showing leadership to be able to provide the type of health care that we want to see from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277198">The past six months have been a time of tremendous trial for my constituents and all Canadians. Loved ones have been lost, families have been separated, businesses have shut down permanently and our government has failed to provide a clear plan for a way forward for this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277199"> Alberta and the other western provinces were hurting before this pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost, including in my constituency. The Liberals have refused to sign off on new resource projects, costing thousands of jobs and billions in investments. Their infrastructure bank and <Affiliation DbId="253366" Type="4">infrastructure minister</Affiliation> have failed to deliver billions of dollars in investments, costing our communities and many more thousands of jobs. Just the other day, Alberta was hurt again with the announcement that Suncor will be laying off thousands of workers, along with TC Energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277200">Canadians pulled together to get us through the first wave of COVID-19. We endured lockdowns in the spring that cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and closed tens of thousands of businesses. Yes, we saved lives, but what did the Liberal government do with the sacrifice of Canadians? It dithered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277201">While our government could have spent the summer procuring rapid testing or planning for an economic recovery, it focused all its energy on shutting down an investigation into its own ethical failures. We have yet to receive the full details of the WE Charity scandal created by the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and if the Liberals had it their way, Canadians would never know the full truth. That is why we are here today, not even a year since the last Speech from the Throne: Instead of governing the nation through this crisis, the Liberals chose to play political games, prorogue Parliament and shut down any committee investigations into their wrongdoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277202">Our Conservative team will not relent. We will hold the Liberal government accountable for its ethical failures. I know that on this side of the House, we are looking forward to sunny ways and sunny days indeed. While many Canadians may be dealing with a COVID pandemic, the government is dealing with an ethical sickness. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been fond of telling the opposition that sunlight is the best disinfectant, and we have heard him loud and clear. We will be taking his advice and prescribing a full dosage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277203">There is a pandemic, and everyone out west is talking about it, but it is not COVID-19; it is the joblessness pandemic. It is a disease that has been with us for years before COVID-19 hit us. Unfortunately, rather than working tirelessly to save our struggling energy industry and the western economies, the Liberals looked eager to dance on our graves and declare our economy bust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277204">Why else would nearly every decision since their election in 2015 appear to be targeted toward undermining our jobs and energy industry, whether it be the pipeline-killing Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, their carbon tax or now their mega carbon tax that is masquerading as a clean fuel standard? Why is it that whenever western MPs stand up for their constituents, they are accused of only playing to regional interests? Whenever our auto sector or aerospace sector is threatened, all Canadian MPs are called together to stand up to save jobs, yet we hear nothing when our energy sector is suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277205">Alberta was proud to support fellow Canadians in the 2008 financial crisis. We carried this country's economy when the federal government had to bail out an American auto company. We were proud to support our brothers and sisters in Newfoundland and Labrador when their offshore industry was suffering. When the Atlantic economy was struggling, it was the cheques sent home by Atlantic workers working in the Alberta oil patch that kept families going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277206">Today, Albertans are struggling and Saskatchewan is struggling. The west is struggling. The engine of Canada's economy is facing record unemployment. Where is our federal government to lend us a hand? We have shovel-ready projects that will create tens of thousands of jobs. We do not even need a bailout from taxpayers; we just need the Liberal government to get out of the way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277207">The Nova Gas Transmission line, which has been waiting for nearly a year for federal approval, would create 5,500 jobs. It is the next generation of polypropylene production in the Alberta industrial heartland. At least 2,500 jobs are on the line, yet the Liberals are pushing forward with their antiplastic manufacturing agenda. With the Liberal mega carbon tax at an estimated $350 a tonne, major players that produce fertilizer to feed our farms and produce fuel to heat our homes are at risk of packing up and moving south of the border. Western Canadians do not need a minister of the middle class and those working hard to join it; we need a minister of the middle class and those working hard just to survive and stay middle class.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277208">The Liberals are promising Canadians a lot of goodies in the throne speech, but nothing that has been promised has not been promised before by the Liberal government. The Liberals will say that this time is different, that they are working with the NDP, which holds the balance of power. We have heard this story before. I have a word of caution to my colleagues in the NDP. They can learn a lot from the B.C. Green Party or the Liberal Democrats in the U.K.: Things never really work out for the junior partner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277209">The throne speech should be praised for its commitment to recycling. By that I mean recycling old Liberal talking points. The Liberals have promised universal pharmacare and a universal day care system. They have promised universal broadband as well. Yet, they have been in power for five years and have failed to deliver for rural communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277210">All of this is happening while the Liberals continue to plow forward with the greatest expansion of government spending and debt financing in modern Canadian history. This is over $400 billion in federal deficit, not counting the hundreds of billions taken out by arm's-length Crown corporations such as the Bank of Canada, BDC, EDC and the CMHC. This is hundreds of billions off the government's books, but hundreds of billions that Canadian taxpayers will still have to pay for if things go bust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277211">How exactly are the Liberals going to finance this new pandemic debt, while also launching the most radical expansion of the Canadian welfare state in a generation? It is with low interest rates, cries the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We can afford everything, as if we can sustain low interest rates for decades on end without the consequences of massive inflation: inflation that will erode the savings of our vulnerable seniors, inflation that will risk the opportunity for millennials and those in generation Z to buy their first home and inflation that will devalue the hard-earned wages of the working class for the benefit of big business and debt holders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277212">If the government chooses not to go down that disastrous path, we are left with two alternatives: They will increase taxes to finance this new spending or they will cut spending in other areas to reallocate to these new promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277213">Will the Liberals be cutting the child care benefit and child care expenses tax deduction for families so they can pay for their new national day care system? Will families be denied the choice of whether to stay home with their young children or send them to day care? When the Liberals remove the Canada child benefit and tax deductions, that is exactly what they are doing. They are removing choice from parents who want to raise their children at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277214">How will the government pay for this new universal pharmacare system? Will they cut health transfers like the Liberals did back in the 1990s? Will they refuse to allow new life-saving drugs like Trikafta, which miraculously saved the lives of those with cystic fibrosis?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277215">If they do not cut spending, they will have to raise taxes. The throne speech talks a bit about this. It talks about raising taxes on digital giants and closing stock loopholes. This is not necessarily something I disagree with, but will these new taxes generate the tens of billions in new dollars that will finance universal day care and universal pharmacare? The fact is that they will not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277216">We are left with few alternatives. Will the Liberals raise the GST that the Conservatives lowered from 7% to 5%? Will they raise personal income taxes or capital gains taxes? Are they going to raise corporation taxes and risk capital and investment being taken to our neighbour to the south, a low-tax jurisdiction?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277217">It is time for the Liberals to be honest with Canadians about their fiscal plan. Canadians deserve that honesty. Will the Liberals allow mass inflation to destroy the middle class? Will they raise taxes on Canadian families? Will they cut spending and benefits? Will it be a combination of all three? Canadians deserve a real answer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277247">Ideas such as communism, state-imposed atheism and coercive family planning all had their genesis in western Europe, and yet they were never fully implemented there, outside of a few fateful months in 1993 and 1994. Generally speaking, while avoided at home, these bad ideas have been imposed in various ways for much longer periods of time on much of the world's poor in Central and Eastern Europe, and in various parts of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. This echo of colonialism, the use of the developing world to experiment with violent and coercive revolutionary policies, which were never really attempted at home, has led to untold suffering and loss of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277248">Revolutionary ideas from the west attacked free enterprise, faith and family. The destruction of pre-existing markets, traditions and family autonomy, with an eye to so-called modernization, obviously did not lead to actual improvements in happiness or quality of life. These experiments were a grand and tragic failure. China's destructive Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution and one-child policy are examples of the horrific impacts of this post-colonial echo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277249">The so-called Great Leap Forward led to between 30 million and 45 million deaths. The Cultural Revolution intentionally turned families against each other in a horrific never-ending show trial of revolutionary purity. These events in China earned Mao the dubious distinction of being the most violent person of the 20th century, but the communism he imposed had its genesis in the west and not in China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277250">The one-child policy led to forced abortion on a massive scale, as well as large-scale infanticide of baby girls, murdered at the hands of desperate parents who preferred a male child. An estimated 100 million missing women were killed or aborted across Asia as a result of the gendered impacts of coercive family planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277251">China's oppressive policies also hampered its development at a time when its neighbours were roaring ahead. Its effects will be enduring, as China deals with skewed sex ratios and a coming demographic winter. Some who work in international development want to talk about a demographic dividend associated with smaller families. However, we are now on the verge of the devastating social impacts that will follow an abrupt aging of the population, which is the result of the steep drop-off in population brought about through coercive family planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277252">The one-child policy was not a crime that the government of China committed alone. The United Nations population fund, while claiming to eschew coercive family planning, gave China's government an award for this policy and funded the data collection system that facilitated it. The UN population fund has yet to recognize and apologize for its complicity in this crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277253">Conservatives will champion a development policy that holds the UN and other multilateral institutions to account, leverages Canadian expertise and involvement, and promotes partnership with the global south. Rather than seeking to upend existing structures of private enterprise, faith and family, we believe in promoting partnerships that seek to help free enterprise, faith and family to flourish according to their proper nature and purpose. That is the true path to humane development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277254">We will restore a principled foreign policy that sides with free nations and freedom-seeking peoples against oppressive governments and coercive international institutions. We will oppose all neo-colonial coercive policies, which limit freedom and choice, and we will make the case for the power of free trade and free markets to fight poverty. This will be animated by the idea of solidarity as an individual and community virtue, and not as an excuse for coercive power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277255">We will support economic growth by seeking to deliver training and financing to the world's poorest entrepreneurs, giving them the capacity to build opportunity for themselves and their families. We will partner with willing nations to strengthen justice systems, fight human trafficking, protect collective security and promote the advancement of propluralism education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277256">Propluralism education is neither narrowly sectarian nor relativistic; rather, it celebrates the traditions and faith of one's own community as well as the rights and contributions of those with different beliefs. Supporting propluralism education is key to supporting the development of harmonious societies around the world. We will fight to restore Canada's historic role defending religious freedom and communal harmony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277257">Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Canada invested more in international development than it does currently. We also gave more to our military, and we even got more votes at the UN. The current government's platitudes tell one story about Canada and the world, but the numbers tell a very different story. The Liberal Party says it will spend more every year on international development, although they have not specified whether that means more in nominal terms, in real terms or as a percentage of gross national income, and currently its contributions are lower than they were under Stephen Harper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277258">The current government is spending larger and larger portions of our aid through multilateral organizations, instead of working with Canadian charities that engage Canadians directly in the delivery of vital assistance, which are often more efficient. This betrays a lack of confidence on the part of the government in Canada and in Canadian organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277259">Conservatives are building a different vision of how a strong international assistance policy can contribute to the advancement of our values. Conservatives believe that our approach to international development must be characterized by respect for and partnership with the global south, not by the imposition of failed revolutionary doctrines of collectivism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277260">I hope that 50 years from now Canada's international development budget will be zero, because the goal of international development is to put itself out of business and establish the conditions whereby nations no longer require the generosity of others in order to survive and thrive. Under the Liberals' economic policies, it is more likely that we will be a recipient of development assistance in 50 years, but I hope for a different path. I hope for a day when development assistance will no longer be necessary because reforms have taken place, education and financing have been made available, vestiges of authoritarian oppression have been dismantled, and free people have been able to prosper through their own ingenuity and with the support and help of strong families and communities.</ParaText>

Accelerated capital cost allowance is an incentive that encourages companies to make investments by allowing them to defer the taxes they pay, but I know that some of those on the anti-energy left are looking to count as a subsidy any kind of incentive program that encourages those kinds of investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277274">Accelerated capital cost allowance is important in my riding for encouraging the development of new, cleaner technologies, including the development of polypropylene, for instance, and other alternatives to make transportation and energy development more effective.

              <ParaText id="6277286">Today I rise to speak on the Speech from the Throne. I first want to acknowledge all of those who have lost their lives to COVID-19 and all of the families, parents, friends and communities that lost loved ones. For those who have recovered, like my good friend from <Affiliation DbId="252738" Type="2">Brampton West</Affiliation>, I am so glad for them, but unfortunately so many families lost people to this virus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277287">It is precisely that loss and the seriousness of this virus that made the Speech from the Throne so important. We needed a reset. This is a crisis that generations have never seen before. Legislators need to be at the forefront, sorting out measures to ensure that Canadians are safe and healthy, and to ensure that post-COVID we will rebound to have a greater economy than we saw pre-COVID, with nearly a million new jobs created. That is precisely where we want to get back to. However, the health and safety of Canadians is paramount, and that is why the Speech from the Throne was so important in addressing a lot of these concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277288">In particular, the long-term care community in my home riding of Pickering—Uxbridge was hit hard. I think that, in Orchard Villa alone, there were 78 deaths. Nearly a third of the population in that long-term care home passed away. It was an extreme tragedy. In Uxbridge, Reachview Village lost 14 members of the community. These are our most vulnerable seniors, and my heart goes out to the families and staff members at the homes who are working hard every day to keep the community safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277289">COVID-19 has demonstrated that there are gaps in long-term care homes, and I am extremely grateful to the Canadian Armed Forces members who went into Orchard Villa in my riding to provide help and support. Frankly, the report that they released was welcome news to many of the families. It was, in fact, just one week prior to that report being released that I was on a Zoom or Facebook call with family members who were describing the scenes in the long-term care home and what the residents were going through, but nobody was listening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277290">The families were frustrated because they could not go in to support their family members, and nobody was paying attention. Everybody was saying there were problems with PPE and with separating those who were infected from those who were not, that staff were going into wings that were COVID-free and then going into wings where people had COVID, and there was no reaction. When the Canadian Armed Forces released that report, those families were able to be heard. All of their concerns were now at the forefront, and we talked about them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277291">When the Speech from the Throne was delivered, my colleagues and I who worked on this file, and family members of residents in particular, were thrilled to see the acknowledgement of the need for national standards for long-term care homes. These are desperately needed. They were probably needed pre-COVID, but COVID really highlighted some of the gaps that needed to be addressed. National standards are a way to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again and that, no matter where one lives in this country, our most vulnerable seniors are going to have a standard of care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277292">The other thing in the Speech from the Throne, with regard to long-term care homes, was the acknowledgement and direction to change the Criminal Code to penalize any individual who neglects our seniors. We read some horrific stories in the Canadian Armed Forces report. In particular, in the home in my riding, we heard that PPE was under lock and key and critical tools were locked away in the basement. These might have prevented deaths had they been accessible to staff and those working hard for the community. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277293">Therefore, that additional Criminal Code change would be incredibly important, moving forward, to hold those accountable who are essentially responsible for some of our most vulnerable Canadians. I think it was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said that we as a country, we as a society, must really think about the fact that we had to send in soldiers to care for our seniors. That is something that I certainly have reflected on a lot. I hope everybody in this House and around the country thinks about it as we move forward with national standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277294">The next area in the Speech from the Throne that I think was important and has resonated with many, certainly for me and my community, were the impacts on women during this crisis. It was predominantly women who took time off work to care for loved ones when they were sick. It was women who often took time off, when schools closed, to care for young children. It was interesting to see a lot of my friends who were trying to work from home with kids in the background. It certainly has proven the need for child care. Reliable child care across this country is incredibly important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277295">I come from the GTA outside of Toronto and child care is incredibly expensive if people can even find it. This acknowledgement of a national child care program is something that we absolutely needed pre-COVID, but COVID once again has highlighted the need for child care and the need to ensure that women are not adversely affected by the changes in the economy, because it is often women who are the caregivers. We still have so much work to be done in terms of equal pay and ensuring that women are integrated into the economy fairly, so any sort of setback is now just hindering our progress in terms of ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277296">To address this issue, the other thing that was important was the action plan for women in the economy. We need to fully understand what the impacts would be, short term as well as long term, for ensuring that women get back into the economy as they were pre-COVID, and women should be into the economy even more. The statistic we had previously was that if women's participation in the workforce were at the same level as men's, it would mean an equivalent to something like 3% in GDP growth. That is the type of economic building we want in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277297">There was a lot in the Speech from the Throne, but another area that is particularly important is support for students. Students were adversely affected because the summer is often when they work to pay for their rent or their college or university. Students are among the people who did not have jobs and they still have to go back to school and still have student debt. Therefore, the supports that we will provide to students to ensure that they do not graduate with enormous debt and they do have jobs on the other side are going to be good, not only for students but also for the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277298">Another piece is our universal broadband fund. My riding is semi-rural, but urban. It is right next door to Toronto, and yet we do not have adequate broadband. This is something that, again, pre-COVID was an issue but during COVID when kids were home learning from school virtually or people were working from home, connectivity was a major issue and something that I am glad we are accelerating our commitments on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277299">I want to acknowledge that the wage subsidy as well as CERB really helped support my community. Businesses would have closed without those supports. I know that we are going to be there to continue to help Canadians as we move forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277300">In addition, the best way to help the economy is by dealing with this health crisis. On the other side, I know Canadians know that Liberals on this side of the House are going to be there to support them. We are going to be there to make sure they are healthy and safe. We are going to be there to build our economy back to pre-COVID and better, because we believe that investing in Canadians is the best way to grow the economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277304">In fact, we were there. We stepped up for communities, for people, provinces and municipalities when the Conservatives talked about not doing anything. They said to get out of the way and let businesses handle it. </ParaText>

Creating national standards is to ensure that, moving forward, every Canadian across this country can receive the level of care they deserve. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277319">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in response to the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277320">I would like to start by offering my condolences to the residents of my community who have lost loved ones and friends and, frankly, to the people across Canada who have lost loved ones and friends to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277321">We are rightly focused on the path ahead, and how we are going to support Canadians. However, it is always important to remember the toll this pandemic has taken. By keeping that in mind, it will motivate us all the more to make sure we are doing the right things going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277322">I also want to thank a few other groups of folks, before I talk about the throne speech. In my community, and I know in communities across Canada, heroes have emerged. One of those groups of heroes is our health care workers, those doctors, nurses, technicians, personal support workers and others who have stepped up, worked on the front lines and who have taken those risks, especially in the early going, to serve Canadians. I want to thank them for their service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277323">I also want to thank a lot of our front-line essential workers. Members will remember that early on, in March, April and May, when much of the economy had to shut down, or at least people had to work from home, some folks still had to go to work. They went out there and they kept our economy going, supporting our quality of life. I want to thank them for that, especially those in my community, in Etobicoke Centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277324">Last, I want to thank those in my community who stepped up to help others. A tremendous number of people in my community and in communities across this country are struggling. People in my community have stepped up, whether it is by volunteering at or donating to a food bank or delivering food to seniors or driving people to medical appointments or whatever the case may be. They have been there to help others, and I want to thank them for that. I have been really impressed with how our community and our country has come together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277325">Early in the pandemic, I imagine I faced what a lot of MPs faced, which was a tremendous number of phone calls and emails from constituents asking for help, asking for help to access health resources, asking for help because they wanted to weigh in on what government was doing, or asking for help because they were struggling, they had lost their jobs or their incomes had been cut or had declined significantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277326">I got a particular phone call, one that was very memorable to me, from a constituent asking for help. Before she got into what her ask was, she asked me how I was doing. I shared with her the fact that we were receiving a tremendous number of calls and emails, and that people needed a lot of help. I said to her that I had run for office to help people, and then she cut me off. She said that I was certainly getting my opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277327"> I share that story because to me it underlines an important point for us that I think we should all remember today, that we are at a critical moment in time and that we all have an opportunity, especially those of us in elected office in positions of decision-making or responsibility, right now. We are at a critical time where Canadians need us and we have an opportunity to support them, and to make our country stronger in the years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277328">I hope that we seize this opportunity. It is on that note that I turn to the throne speech, because when I think about what we need to do, I think about supporting Canadians, I think about making sure that we protect them from this virus, and I think about building back better. The throne speech focuses on those things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277329">What I would like to do is just highlight a few of the items in the throne speech that I think are particularly important. First off, on protecting Canadians, there are a number of measures that have been taken, starting with controlling the epidemic by encouraging social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, and tracing and quarantining of people who have tested positive. We have also increased health system capacity, made tremendous investments for the provinces so that they can boost their health system capacity and cope with the COVID-19 cases. We have been very active in investing significantly in treatments, specifically in vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277330">We have done a tremendous number of things to make sure that we have contracted for vaccines, that the manufacturing capacity is in place, that we have contracts with the various folks who are researching these vaccines, so that when a vaccine is ready, Canadians will be able to access it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277331">There is also the $19-billion safe restart agreement. It is interesting to hear the members of the opposition ask what the government has done to support provinces and their health care budgets in this difficult time. The $19 billion seems awfully significant to me, and a lot of that money went to health care. It went for testing and contact tracing. There was $2 billion for the safe return to class fund to make sure that when provinces opened their schools, they had our support in making sure those schools were opened safely, and that children and families were protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277332">These are some of the things that have been done to protect Canadians from the virus from a health perspective.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277335">To address this issue, our federal Liberal government took urgent action during the pandemic by introducing a $100-million emergency fund, $50 million for the surplus purchase fund and $25 million to nutrition north Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277336">Community Food Centres Canada, located in my riding of Davenport, is dedicated to addressing food insecurity and its root causes and is doing vital work across the country. According to a new report it published, 81% of food insecure people say it takes a toll on their physical health, 79% say it impacts their mental health and 53% say it is a barrier to finding meaning in life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277337">Community Food Centres let me know how excited it was to hear a commitment in the throne speech to specifically address food insecurity in Canada. It is time to build a stronger, more equitable Canada. I look forward to working with all my colleagues in the House to implement our government's commitments in the Speech from the Throne and to make sure all Canadians can have access to affordable, nutritious food.</ParaText>

People could expect a call at any hour of the day asking them to help a stranger out or what they were in need of. My own story is that on the night that my youngest daughter passed away two years ago, somehow Pastor Ray knew at midnight that something had happened. He gave me a call and asked whether I needed anything. Then, at 1 a.m. in the morning, he showed up at the hospital and stayed with us for hours until we were better.</ParaText>

The Liberal plan only aims to build 150,000 units of affordable housing over 10 years, effectively saying that it is acceptable to leave close to 100,000 Canadians without homes. The housing strategy was a planned failure from the start. A rapid housing initiative of building 3,000 units is not enough when, in Vancouver alone, over 2,000 people are homeless.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277580">Mr. Speaker, just before question period, I was speaking about some of the elements of the throne speech that are particularly important and will be impactful to members of my community. I had spoken about how the throne speech proposes measures to protect Canadians and now I want to talk about how we are supporting Canadians through the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277581">We all know very well that countless people across Canada, and in my community of Etobicoke Centre, are suffering economically as a result of the pandemic. Many have lost their jobs and incomes have been impacted and declined. There are a number of measures that we have implemented and will be implementing through the throne speech going forward to address these challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277582">The first category is supporting workers and their families. That is why we created the CERB, so Canadians could continue to pay their bills. We are also transitioning to a redesigned EI program, one that allows people to qualify more easily, one that will allow self-employed workers to qualify. A number of other programs we are launching shortly will support Canadians who need help through this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277583">Through the throne speech, we are also taking measures to create jobs. There is a plan to create one million jobs and part of that is an extension of the wage subsidy to help those companies that continue to struggle to keep their workers or hire their workers back so those people continue to have incomes and jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277584">Supporting businesses is another important component of this is. To those businesses that employ folks in my riding and across Canada, an extension of the wage subsidy is a big component of that. Many businesses have taken advantage of the wage subsidy and of course we will continue to provide that through to next summer. We are also improving the business credit availability program because providing credit is one of the key mechanisms in which we support businesses trying to get through this difficult period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277585">I often hear from some of my constituents saying these are great programs, but what about their finances and fiscal sustainability of this plan. One of the things the throne speech speaks to is that very issue. Obviously, these are costly programs, but I believe it is true and many economists believe it is true, that we would be much worse off fiscally and economically if we had not taken the steps we are taking and if we do not take the steps proposed in the throne speech. It is incumbent upon those members across the aisle who continue to talk about fiscal sustainability, who continue to talk about our economy, if they are going to support that, to vote for—</ParaText>

That is incredibly important for this generation and the next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277589">I also want to talk about seniors. There are a number of measures to support seniors in the throne speech. One is the commitment to increase the old age security once someone turns 75 and to boost the Canada pension plan survivor benefit to take action to allow seniors to stay in their homes longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277590">I am most proud of the government's commitment to work with the provinces and territories to implement national standards for long-term care. In Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 43 residents taken by COVID-19 at the Eatonville Care Centre. In May, we received a report from the Canadian Armed Forces that documented horrific conditions in a number of long-term care homes across Canada, across Ontario and Quebec, and one of those was the Eatonville Care Centre.</ParaText>

In the speech from the throne, the government has committed to that very thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277592">I have been advocating for national standards because I believe this is a crisis that touches every province across Canada. National standards are the only way to ensure that the necessary resources are invested and reforms are made to make sure our seniors in long-term care get the care they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277593">I started my remarks by talking about my constituent who called me and talked about how I had an opportunity as an elected official to make a difference for my constituents, particularly now in a moment of crisis. To me, that means protecting Canadians, supporting Canadians through this and building back our country even better in the years to come. To me, the Speech from the Throne articulates policies that will allow us to achieve those three goals. I hope opposition members support the Speech from the Throne so we can seize that opportunity together.</ParaText>

This is meant to impact all of those who are collecting CPP, including those who are 68 that the member alluded to. In addition, in the throne speech, the government has committed to increase the old age security once a senior turns 75 and boost the survivor benefits. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277609">Madam Speaker, this is a time when Canadians are looking for stability, safety and comfort. Ultimately, they are looking for a plan. They deserve more than simply a show, which, unfortunately, is what they got. They are looking for answers, for a solid plan, for a way forward, for more than simply the empty pages that they received. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277610">Instead of working collaboratively with opposition parties to come up with a solution, the Liberals made the decision to shut out those on the opposition side. In years past when there have been wars, it has been common that there would be a war cabinet. Individuals from different parties got together and were given the opportunity to contribute their thoughts and ideas to the policy that would bring us forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277611">What resulted from the team Liberal approach were significant delays in the delivery of support for Canadians. Tens of thousands of Canadians got left behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277612">Earlier in the year, provincial governments across the country pushed for temporary shutdowns so that plans could be created to get up and running in a very safe capacity. Parliament was also shut down, businesses were closed and people stayed home for long periods of time. Everyone assumed that it was simply a provisional pause that would allow us to put a plan in place to move forward within a framework of safety. Months have passed and still there is no economic recovery plan present. It begs the question: Why not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277613">On August 18, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had the Governor General prorogue Parliament. He justified this extreme action by saying that he would deliver a Speech from the Throne, and within it he said that he would deliver, “a “bold” agenda for [Canada's] economic recovery”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277614"> After the shutdown, many speculated that this was not in fact going to be the case, that really he prorogued Parliament in order to bring a stop to the scandal with respect to $912 million being rolled out the door and given to the WE Charity Foundation, a foundation that has benefited his friends and family. Those were the speculations; however, the content of the speech would prove that perhaps the speculations are in fact true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277615">There were three parliamentary committees that were starting to get to the bottom of the WE scandal. Documents that would bring light to the government's involvement were on their way to the committees, just when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pushed the big red stop button. Is it a coincidence? I think not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277616">A throne speech is an opportunity for the government to outline a vision and a plan, a way forward for the people of Canada. My colleagues and I were hoping the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would use this as an opportunity for a reset. He would have prioritized the approval for rapid test kits, the acquisition of vaccines and support for local communities across this country. We were expecting a detailed economic recovery plan that would emphasize the importance of two economic engines that are necessary for our recovery as a nation: namely, energy and agriculture. We anticipated a message of unity that would cast a grand vision to bring the people of this great country together from coast to coast toward a common goal called “recovery”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277617">There was no leadership taken. There was no vision put forward. There certainly was no plan presented. It was an absolute disappointment. The throne speech instead was filled with fluff, visions of rainbows and the promise of unicorns. Rather than presenting a concrete plan, the speech contained platitudes and regurgitated, recycled promises from Liberal platforms of old. There was nothing new, only a repackaging of what had previously been stated. There was no leadership, no vision, no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277618">What we can expect now is millions and millions of dollars to go out the door. Do not get me wrong: Millions and millions and billions have already left. There was no plan to balance the budget, but the money continues to roll out. Where is all the money coming from? No one seems to know. Following the speech, in his address to the nation, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “I don’t want you or your parent or your friend to take on debt that your government can better shoulder.” The fact of the matter is there is no money tree and governments can only get their money from one source: taxation, Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277619">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is spending the next generation's paycheques. He wants our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren to pay for his spending long after he is gone. Programs will be cut. Essential services will be cut. Taxes will skyrocket.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277621">Again, there is no plan, just a lot of money rolling out the door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277622">No other conclusion can be drawn, except that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament to distract Canadians from his massive ethical breach within the WE scandal. He shut everything down to protect himself. Once again, the Prime Minister proved that he is more about protecting his image than serving the well-being of Canadians by presenting a concrete way forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277623">He keeps saying that we need to build back better. What he really means is that he is taking his time to choose which sectors he believes are worthy of resurrection and which deserve to die. He is picking winners and losers based on his ideological agenda. Those in the west are entirely shut out. It is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277624">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has turned a blind eye to energy and agriculture, never mind that the need for energy grows day by day, or the fact that food is essential to life. These two industries do not make the cut when it comes to the current Prime Minister and his political agenda, so they just get left out in the cold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277625">The worst thing about having an activist prime minister is that he rarely focuses on the things that are good for everyone, that are good for the whole and that would unify this country. Instead, subgroups, pet projects and ideological agendas are what take the cake. They reign supreme, while entire parts of the country and key responsibilities of the government are shelved. They are completely ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277626">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> often speaks about clean growth and a green future, but what he fails to mention is that Canada's oil and gas industry has some of the highest environmental regulatory schemes of anywhere in the world. It has leveraged technology and Canadian ingenuity to continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are leading in carbon capture and storage technology worldwide. By punishing Canada's energy sector, the Prime Minister is indirectly boosting production in other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, where human rights atrocities are common and where environmental protections do not exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277627">The Prime Minister is standing for that type of energy development, instead of basing it right here at home, and that is wrong. A responsible government would insist on developing energy ethically. A responsible government would insist on taking care of the environment, and we can do that right here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277628">Here are the facts. Millions of Canadians are still unemployed and eager to return to work, but instead of showing leadership and presenting Canadians a clear path forward through the pandemic, the current government continues to let Canadians flounder. There was a time, not so long ago, when countries around the world were looking to Canada to help them navigate the 2008 recession. They were looking to us for leadership, but now we are at the bottom of the G7, and certainly not being looked to as an example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277629">What we have witnessed over the last several months is akin to a play where actors are delivering rehearsed lines to an audience that has been forced to watch and forced to pay. Trained actors give grand performances on a large stage, trying their best to tickle the ears of their audience members as they offer dramatic monologues in hopes of eliciting applause. As the evening show comes to an end and the curtain is drawn, the audience members leave with a massive bill in hand. Some feel wowed. Some are disappointed, and others feel utterly exploited. This show was not as advertised. Meanwhile, the actors gather backstage, patting one another on the back and going out for beers. They are excited to come back tomorrow and take centre stage once again. Meanwhile, the audience members return home, fighting for their very existence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277630">Canadians are full of ingenuity, hope and a vision for the future. They have the ability to help bring this country back. They simply need a prime minister who will empower them to do so. When will the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> recognize that leadership of a country is more than just a show?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277653">Parliament reopened two weeks ago. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada had decided to prorogue Parliament when Canada was in the midst of a crisis. This meant that the administrative process and committee meetings, among other things, were on hold. Furthermore, parliamentarians' rights were curtailed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277654">I remind members that the Prime Minister decided to prorogue Parliament six weeks ago to get the Liberals out of a jam. The government served its own interests instead of serving the interests of Canadians. This summer, we were talking about WE Charity. The Prime Minister's wife had received money from WE Charity. It was public money. Recently, the Liberals stated that we cannot do indirectly what we cannot do directly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277655">The Prime Minister's wife received money, the Prime Minister's brother received money and the Prime Minister's mother received money. Nearly $300,000 made its way into his family's pockets. That is unacceptable. This all happened just before Parliament was prorogued. That organization paid for trips taken by the former <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. He has since stepped down. His daughters were part of or associated with WE Charity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277656">Rumour has it that WE Charity helped draft the framework to ensure that it would be able to participate in the government tendering process. That is just a rumour, but where there is smoke, there is fire. WE Charity was awarded a nearly $1-billion contract without any competition at all. On top of that, they forgot to include rules for francophones in Quebec and across Canada. They were forced to subcontract to a bilingual company, one that was able to serve francophones but could not bid on the whole project. That was the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277657">Remember, this is a time of crisis. Today, Quebec reported the highest number of new cases since the pandemic began. More than 1,360 cases were announced. This is serious. We need to act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277659">I must admit that some measures made sense. Some of the measures brought in by the government were logical. A responsible government takes that kind of action. It helps people and businesses. Some programs that were brought in were good. I am not afraid to say it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277660">However, programs must evolve. The problem with this government is that it was unable and unwilling to advance and improve the programs. I am thinking about the CERB and the CESB, which disincentivized work. As the member for Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, I get up every morning to make sure that we have a good society that values work. That is the future and potential of a society. We have to value work and hard-working people. We cannot lower our standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277661">I would remind hon. members that we are in a crisis and that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to shut down Parliament. When Parliament resumed, we were treated to a Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277662">Since the government had six weeks to prepare it, I was anticipating a unique Speech from the Throne for a unique situation. I was expecting the Speech from the Throne to announce immediate measures for finding solutions to help workers, businesses, seniors, and persons with disabilities in our country. There is nothing like that, nothing concrete. It announced that money had been given to the provinces for school re-entry. That had already been announced two weeks prior.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277663">I was expecting to hear about a test deployment plan. Testing is a problem right now. People do not know whether or not they have COVID-19, and what is more, they cannot get a test. The Prime Minister and his government are supposedly in the process of approving tests that will arrive next week, from what I hear. The tests will arrive in Canada next week, but when will they be distributed? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277664"> I was expecting to see a clear plan in the throne speech for rolling out testing. The Prime Minister's friend, the Governor General, was given this pre-election platform to read. Then, since this is a serious crisis, the Prime Minister asked the national networks for air time to address Canadians and deliver a clear public service announcement. I will call it that since I cannot remember the right term. Unfortunately, I learned nothing from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277665">I watched the Prime Minister provoke the provinces, his allies, in a time of crisis. He looked into the camera and said that things needed to change and were going to change for long-term care homes and seniors. What has changed since? Nothing. It was all lip service, empty words. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277666">I was expecting to see a plan for economic recovery. France, Germany and South Korea have presented practical plans. I want to be proud to be Canadian. I want to be a leader. I want to emerge from this crisis with my head held high. Yes, it is a crisis, and yes, we need to help people, but we need to find a way through this crisis as quickly as possible. When he was facing an economic crisis, Prime Minister Harper implemented measures to ensure that we would be the first to emerge from it. I am proud of this fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277667">I look forward to my colleagues' questions. I expected much more from the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277668">Members will have understood from my speech that I will probably be voting no this evening.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277685">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for this opportunity to reply to the Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277687">Like other members, I have been out and about with constituents and others. The general pattern of the conversation is to lament the progress of this pandemic and then the conversation tends to move toward how we will pay for this. The programs the government has put in place are generally well received, very welcome and are life rests to people in real desperation. It is quite right to say that the government has made its balance sheet available to Canadian citizens. Nevertheless, there will be a day of reckoning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277688">I will focus a bit on the necessity of fiscal anchors, but before I do, I want to point to the central truth of the Speech from the Throne, and that is that we need to do all we can to restore the nation's health. This is the pre-eminent priority of the Government of Canada and should be the pre-eminent priority of the Parliament of Canada. Without the restoration of the nation's health, there simply will not be any restoration of the nation's wealth. The saying that the first wealth is health has never been more true than it is today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277689">In 1993, The New York Times nominated Canada as an honorary member of the third world. Our debt and deficits had risen to unsustainable levels, vulnerable to inflation, runs on the dollar and other economic shocks. In 1997 through to 2006, the Chrétien and Martin governments paid down the national debt by something in the order of $100 billion, taking the debt-to-GDP ratio from north of 65% to somewhere in the order of 25%. Fiscal discipline and a robust economy allowed Canada to exit its honorary status as a third world nation and become the envy of the G7, the G20 and other OECD economies. We have been living on that legacy ever since.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277690">The emergence of COVID-19 has driven our debt-to-GDP ratio much higher and it is now in the range of 49%. Recently the Parliamentary Budget Office issued a fiscal update. It has made three sobering assumptions: first, that there will be no widely available vaccine for the next 12 to 18 months; second, that current response measures will be withdrawn on schedule; and third, that the Bank of Canada will maintain a prime rate of 0.25% through to 2023 and further maintain its program of quantitative easing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277691">Between December 2019 and June 2020, Canada's real GDP collapsed by 13.4%, and the PBO does not expect it to recover to the December 2019 levels until March 2022. As the GDP goes, so also go the revenues of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277692"> I appreciate the PBO's candour and recognize that all projections, whether they are from the Department of Finance or the PBO, are subject to some very significant caveats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277693">Canada is a trading nation. It is both a strength and a vulnerability. Our most significant trading partner has been in turmoil for the last four years. We might all hope that November 3 might bring a more stable and predictable relationship, but we cannot count on it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277694">Our number two trading partner, China, seems to be determined to turn Canada into a vassal state, kidnapping Canadian citizens, making arbitrary trade decisions, practising a hectoring diplomacy and introducing mass surveillance, all of which make the Chinese Communist Party an unreliable partner. The pandemic has woefully exposed our dependence on any supply chain that runs through China. In addition, our third-largest trading partner seems to be consumed yet again by Brexit discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277695">In this gloomy context of unreliable trading partners, an unpredictable virus and unsustainable spending, what is a <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> to do? Ultimately, the finance minister is the Dr. No of cabinet. However, it is helpful when saying no to attach the no to a stated rationale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277696">I, for one, would like to see a joint statement from the Department of Finance and the Parliamentary Budget Office giving their best projections on the GDP of the nation. In addition, I would like to see some effort to reconcile any differences. It would be in the national interest to have a common understanding of our fiscal and economic picture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277697">Second, I would like to see a fiscal anchor or series of fiscal anchors. If there is no fiscal anchor, the ship of state will inevitably go in dizzying circles. There are plenty of anchors to choose from. A stable debt-to-GDP ratio has the advantage of being widely accepted and easily understandable. The disadvantage is in the short run: It will deteriorate very quickly, as both the numerator and the denominator are going in opposite directions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277698">Another fiscal anchor is a balanced budget. At this point it is an unrealistic fiscal anchor, as implicitly acknowledged by my friend, the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, who recognized that balanced budgets may be more than 10 years away. By the way, I was pleased to see him in the House and look forward to his being Her Majesty's leader of the official opposition for many years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277699">Another fiscal anchor is inflation. Some say we should let inflation be the only anchor, or otherwise simply let programs expand. Still others propose a cap on spending. The disadvantage of a cap on spending is that it is entirely arbitrary and lacks flexibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277700">David Dodge, the former deputy minister and former governor of the Bank of Canada, suggests a fiscal anchor tied to the cost of the national debt. He suggests that the cost of servicing the national debt should not exceed 10% of government revenues on an annual basis, and that, in addition, we should eventually reduce annual deficits to no more than 1% of GDP. Mr. Dodge also wants all government investments, all programs, tied to an increase in productivity. Canada has for quite a number of years now been a laggard in productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277701">My purpose here is to urge the government to pick a fiscal anchor or anchors to recognize that the Government of Canada is not the economy of Canada. At some point Dr. No has to say no, because to say otherwise would be to cut the ship of state from “wise and prudent management”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277702">Canada is not like the U.S. It can do wild and crazy fiscal things and get away with it because it is the world's currency. The Canadian dollar is a small currency in a very large pool. If either inflation or a run on the dollar occur, all the presumptions of cheap money are out the window. At this point we do have cheap money. Let us hope that it continues, because a number of the assumptions are based upon this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277703">With that, I hope the government will commit to fiscal anchors and we can have a realistic conversation about the program mix.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277705">He made a lot of very good points. He quite rightly gave credit to the Chrétien and Martin government for adopting balanced budgets and reducing our debt. He quite rightly pointed out that in the early 1990s this country literally ran out of money when finance officials went to lending markets and could not find a single person on earth willing to lend a dollar to the Government of Canada for fear it could not pay the money back. At that time, our debt-to-GDP ratio was 66.6%. A half-year ago, it was 30%. In other words, we had about a 36% buffer of space between where we were and where we could expect to go bankrupt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277706">Today, it is at 50% of GDP. In other words, the government has more than eliminated half of the buffer that existed between where we were and where we go off the cliff. That means the trajectory we are on is not sustainable. The problem with cliffs is that while one approaches them gradually, one falls off them suddenly, and once off the cliff, it is too late.</ParaText>

Now that the second wave has arrived, we must do everything we can to flatten the curve and help bring this virus to an end. We flattened the curve once and we can do it again, because we are all in this together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277721"> It is clear to me that the impacts of COVID-19 are going to be felt for generations. To rebuild a stronger Canada and ensure the safety of Canadians, we must look to the future and take some bold actions to protect everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277722">The Speech from the Throne is an opportunity for our government to step back, take stock of where we are and set out the priorities of where we want to go to come through this in a positive way. It is an opportunity for parliamentarians to discuss and debate the role and direction of the government. I know this government will help Canadians across the country. That is what we are committed to doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277723">I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few aspects of the throne speech that clearly will help assist the residents of Humber River—Black Creek.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277724">We all know, and continue to lecture, to wear a mask, wash our hands and keep our distance. These are not easy things, but they are inevitable if we want to save ourselves from the epidemic. Most importantly, we must make sure Canadians will be able to get a vaccine once it is ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277725">It is going to take all of us working together to keep each other safe and beat this virus. I have had to make requests for multiple test sites in my riding, as unfortunately it is a hot spot. I was pleased we were able to set up temporary sites at the Humber River Hospital, at Church Street and at the Gord and Irene Risk Community Centre, as well as at several other places, to get testing done. Until we can ensure that everybody gets a test when they need it and gets results in a timely fashion, with timeliness being key, we are not going to be able to end this pandemic. Contact tracing and testing are paramount, and I know that our government is committed to working with municipalities and the provinces to achieve this goal. I do not want anybody who needs a test to be turned away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277726">I know my constituency staff have done a wonderful job and have received a number of positive calls from constituents and business owners expressing their gratitude for the various programs our government has created. Without them they would have never been able to make ends meet. The CERB program has provided immense assistance and relief to the constituents of my riding. Frankly, I am immensely grateful to the government for creating programs that were very much needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277727">Let me give the House a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277728">My office staff helped a young single mother with two kids under five. She was laid off in March because of COVID-19, living on her own and managing everything without help. When my office first spoke to her she really did not have any faith that the government would help her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277729">She applied for the CERB and waited for it to come through. It came through just in time for her to pay the rent. My office was able to assist this young woman to successfully receive her CERB payment, a true success story at that particular moment. In the last conversation I had with this constituent, she said it had restored her faith in government and she thanked us very much. The woman has gone back to work and remains grateful for the assistance she received from my office staff every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277730">There are a number of cases like this where constituents are hopeless and if it were not for the CERB they would never have been able to survive. Everyone I have spoken with who has lost their job during this pandemic, which is a lot of people, would not have known what to do if it were not for this benefit and the many others our government has created that are helping Canadians every day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277731">Before I continue to highlight more of the positive benefits of our government's assistance for Canadians, I would like to take a minute to acknowledge the hard work of my staff and the staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, especially the member for <Affiliation DbId="252719" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>, who is the <Affiliation DbId="253803" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>. He is a true leader with a caring heart. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277732">During the start of the pandemic, he was an immense help to my office as we successfully repatriated numerous constituents and their family members from around the world. This amazing work should not go unnoticed. The repatriation of Canadians during these difficult times is heartwarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277733">The reason I am so aware of the repatriation process of Canadians is that my office worked closely with a local travel agency, which is the heart of the riding. Lina Matturro, a small business owner, operates Islington Travel in the Humber River—Black Creek riding. She has experienced many ups and downs during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277734">I would like to share some excerpts from a piece of correspondence my office recently received from Lina. She wrote, “The travel industry has undergone severe trauma, and while we are strong and resilient, we are definitely dealing with new experiences in unprecedented times. I have owned and operated a small travel agency in a local community for just over 43 years, and clearly was not prepared for COVID-19. Even before the Canadian government declared a state of emergency, our office was already working 24-7 to rearrange flights for our clients. We frantically worked on getting passengers back to Canada. The financial hardship has been unbelievable. I have zero income coming in and still have a ton of expenses. The rent relief program has been a lifesaver. Without that program, I would have had to close the door months ago.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277735">Small businesses in Canada, like Islington Travel, have been hit especially hard. We know this. Forced closures, reduced capacity, supply chain disruptions and reduced revenue are just some of the challenges our resilient small businesses have faced. We all know that small businesses are the economic backbone of Canada. We know that it will take some time for their businesses to return to pre-COVID-19 performance levels. That is why we have taken, again, decisive measures to help keep Canadian small businesses operational, such as with the extension of the Canada emergency wage subsidy to the summer of 2021. We have expanded access to the Canada emergency business account and made improvements to the business credit availability program, and that is just a sample. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277736">We are working hard to ensure that small business owners, like Lina, will have quick and easy access to meaningful financial support so that they can get through this tough time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277737">I have been advocating, alongside several of my colleagues, for national standards on the issue of long-term care. I was appalled at what happened with the long-term care home in my riding, Hawthorne Place, and many others. I have worked with my colleagues to push forward the request for us to have national standards of care. We have national standards for everything else in this country. Why would we not have national standards for something as important as how we treat our elderly in long-term care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277738"> I am pleased to say that the government, in the throne speech, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in particular, heard that call. He was appalled at what he saw and heard through that process. We will see the long-needed implementation of national standards for long-term care as soon as possible, and I am talking about actual implementation, not just a commitment, not just words on a piece of paper or a report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277739">I know that people will say that the federal government has no right to be into this as it is a provincial issue. I have said it myself, but that did not stop me and my colleagues from pushing forward. This is an issue for all Canadians. We have to improve on this area, and we are going to start now. It is an issue that will soon see progress with the implementation of much-needed standards of care across the board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277740">We are building back better. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, this is not necessarily the time for austerity. We are here to help Canadians. Ensuring that Canadians are supported through this health crisis is the best thing we can do for the economy. Canadians should not have to choose between their health and their jobs. We will continue to help Canadians to put food on the table, keep businesses open, create jobs, support women in the economy and ensure our fiscal sustainability.</ParaText>

None of us wants to be spending all this money, but the reality is that if we do not help Canadians now, then when do they need a government? They need a government now when we have a pandemic and that is exactly what we are doing. We are going to do whatever is necessary to help Canadians survive this terrible pandemic.</ParaText>

When we are trying to balance out what we can do with a reasonable amount of money, trying to increase the pension from age 65 and on in a way that would help many of those seniors, we utilized the GIS program to the best of our ability. We did make a commitment. We know that when one gets to be 75 years old, for many of these seniors, it becomes very difficult for them. There is an increased number of expenses at that time.

              <ParaText id="6277756">Before I get into the substance of my remarks, I would like to remind all of my colleagues that the pandemic we are facing has prompted a renewed focus on scientific studies and the mobilization of the entire scientific community around links that may exist between zoonotic diseases, pollution, climate change and the emergence of pandemic phenomena. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277757">Hundreds of specialists were already conducting research into this credible and well-documented area of study. In October 2019, the Canadian Public Health Association released its recommendations on the human health implications of climate change and the urgency to act on climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277758">Publications that have come out over the past few months point to an increased risk of pandemics with the loss of biodiversity. Global warming is altering temperate zones. Other zoonotic diseases are expected to emerge as did Lyme disease. Protecting biodiversity is not a pipe dream. It must be done. Biodiversity is the cornerstone of an effective strategy to address the impacts of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277759">By giving environmental issues the importance and prominence they deserve, we can take concrete action to prevent zoonotic diseases from becoming pandemics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277760"> I now want to talk about the environmental aspects of the throne speech, found in the section entitled “Taking action on extreme risks from climate change”. I have been the Bloc Québécois's environment critic since mid-March, and I want to point out that it is extremely important for the government to understand that a fair economic recovery and a green economic recovery can easily happen together. There is no doubt that we can work on economic recovery and protect the environment at the same time. However, investing in fossil fuels is not the way to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277761">We appreciate that the government realizes pollution requires immediate climate action, as it showed in its throne speech. However, I encourage members to read the Bloc Québécois's recovery plan to learn how we can quickly get moving on climate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277762">The Speech from the Throne states, “The Government will immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada’s 2030 climate goal. The Government will also legislate Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277763">Madam Speaker, do you know what the problem is with that statement? Canada is not even close to achieving its objectives. Environment Canada's projections show that we may reduce greenhouse gases by 19.5% at most by 2030. This represents a shortfall of 77 megatonnes. We are certainly going to need meaningful action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277764">Let's begin with legislative measures. The Bloc Québécois, through the member for <Affiliation DbId="252929" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation>, proposed framework legislation that would require the federal government to meet its own targets. There were promises, targets and projects, and we also see that the international community is critical of Canada's climate inaction with regard to its Paris agreement commitments. Canada's current environmental position is unenviable. It is high time that the government did something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277765">Given the decisions that the government has made since 2015 and all the deregulation that has occurred since the pandemic, it seems urgent and necessary to us that the House support the bill introduced by my colleague from Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277766">The throne speech indicates that the government “will ensure Canada is the most competitive jurisdiction in the world for clean technology companies”. Clearly, the government will have to put words into action and stop turning a blind eye to environmental issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277767"> Creating thousands of retrofit jobs? We support that. Investing in reducing the impact of climate-related disasters and figuring out how to adapt? We support that too. Reducing the impact? We agree. We understand that we need an emergency plan in case of disaster. That goes without saying. However, why not start by recognizing the need for prevention?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277768">We must do whatever we can to mitigate climate change and recognize new discoveries from around the world. That would help us move faster.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277769">The throne speech talks about modernizing the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Is that not what hundreds of organizations, researchers and reports have been saying we need to do for years?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277770">The 87 recommendations in the 2017 report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development gave Environment Canada an exhaustive look at what needs changing. This is no small task. The mountain is high, but we must climb it. It would be a very bad idea to modernize the act by making a few superficial changes of no real consequence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277771">The Bloc Québécois certainly welcomes the announcement about the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, but we want to be sure that this mission will really be taken seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277772">When the report came out, the authors clearly indicated that thousands of people in Canada who are exposed to toxic substances die prematurely and that millions more get preventable diseases. Ideas evolve. The Canadian act has not kept pace with scientific progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277773">With the emergence of COVID-19 and concerns about human health and vulnerability to the virus, I implore all my colleagues to recognize the intersectional nature of environmental issues, especially in relation to human health. The challenges of our time demand it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277774">Another possible path forward would be to pass a zero-emission law modelled after California's legislation. This is a very serious avenue that is having significant, positive effects on human health in relation to pollution levels caused by greenhouse gases. A bill was passed unanimously in the Quebec National Assembly recently. This could serve as a catalyst to increase the availability of electric vehicles in Canada. That was mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, but companies need to get up to speed and start producing more electric vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277775">On a slightly different note, it should come as no surprise to anyone, incidentally, that I denounce the elements in the Speech from the Throne relating to the environment because, as they are currently written, they encroach on the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277776">The Bloc Québécois supports protecting nature and green spaces in municipalities as it supports water management. However, it is up to Quebec and the provinces to determine how they want to address these matters. The federal government needs to take care of its own jurisdictional responsibilities, not those of Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277777">In addition to the carefully crafted legislative measures that absolutely must be passed swiftly, there will also be an unavoidable cost to begin the transition to a zero-emissions future. The speech outlines supports, programs and federal funding earmarked for consolidating climate goals. There are similarities to the Bloc Québécois's recovery plan starting with research incentives for developing electric heavy-duty and commercial vehicles. Given Quebec's enviable sectoral development in the field, it definitely needs to benefit from some of that support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277778">Quebec's SMEs proved to be ingenious, bold and resilient when they got into this industry 15 years ago, when this sector of the economy was emerging. Now, Quebec is North America's transportation electrification hub. A green and fair recovery must recognize the different expertise and strengths the various regions have to offer. We cannot pit one region against another. We must focus on how they complement each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277779">I will close by quickly saying a few words about the state of the country's finances. There has indeed been some deficit spending as a result of the pandemic in order to provide help to our constituents. Is it not obscene to carry on with the fantasy of the Trans Mountain project? Who would argue that $12 billion has to stay in this project? Nearly 100 signatories, including Canadian economists, experts and scientists wrote the government on September 16 to say no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277780">The Bloc Québécois traditionally stands in support of workers. Workers take a lot of flack for the endless aid that is given to the oil sector. In the Bloc Québécois recovery plan, we propose taking this money and allocating it to renewable energy projects in Alberta.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6277797">Madam Speaker, when he was the federal industry minister, the late Jean Lapierre said that the aerospace industry is to Quebec what the auto industry is to Ontario. That is true, because we are talking about 40,000 direct jobs, 100,000 indirect jobs, 220 businesses, including 200 SMEs, and $18 billion in sales, of which 80% are exports. It is the leading exporter in Quebec. With 12% of manufacturing exports, Quebec accounts for 50% of jobs, 60% of sales, and 70% of research and development in Canada's aerospace sector. The sector funds 55% of industrial R and D in Quebec. The greater Montreal area is the third-largest aerospace hub on the planet after Seattle, with Boeing, and Toulouse, with Airbus. It is an integrated industry. There are only three places on earth where we can find suppliers capable of providing all the components to build an aircraft from nose to tail. The greater Montreal area is one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277798">Continuing with the statistics, the number of times that the term “aerospace” or “aviation” appears in the Speech from the Throne is zero. This industry is in trouble. It was already struggling, but COVID-19 has made things worse. Certain economic sectors will be affected for longer than others and will need special assistance. The aerospace industry is one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277799">The Speech from the Throne mentions culture, tourism and agriculture. We will see how that goes. We will see if rhetoric becomes reality, but at least they got mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277800">The aerospace industry is probably one of the most important parts of Quebec's industrial landscape. Airlines are the primary clients of the civilian aerospace sector, and they are struggling. We know that planes have been grounded. There is no maintenance and no replacement parts. Orders for new planes are few and far between, and it will stay that way for years to come. Airlines that submitted orders are postponing taking delivery of the aircraft to avoid having to pay the balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277801">Since the spring, 4,000 aerospace jobs have been lost. The industry resigned itself to creating ties with the construction industry so it could send workers there, at the risk of losing expertise and the ability to bounce back. That also means that there are SMEs that might end up closing their doors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277802">We have always advocated for an aerospace policy. What exactly is an aerospace policy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277803">I often talk about this, as did several of my predecessors assigned to this file. The government says it has already provided help. However, a real policy means more than providing sporadic help. It means more than providing funding here and there, no matter how much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277804">I will take the risk of explaining what a real aerospace policy is, in the Parliament of a country that is rather foreign to the concept of economic nationalism. Very few sectors are protected and supported and have a real strategy dedicated to them. The aerospace sector should be one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277805">Of all the countries with a significant aerospace industry, Canada is the only one without a policy to support its development. That is why the Bloc Québécois plans to raise this issue before the standing committee on industry in order to identify the challenges and the vision needed, thereby forcing the government's hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277806">An aerospace policy means, first and foremost, a space where all stakeholders, including companies, workers and governments, have a seat at the table to convey their realities and needs. Ottawa already does this for the auto industry. It also means specific programs tailored to the reality of the sector. It means predictable support that allows stakeholders to anticipate and commit to longer-term projects. Of course, it requires a comprehensive vision that encompasses all the links in the chain, including a military procurement policy that strengthens the entire cluster. It means sharing the risks associated with the biggest projects. It means reviewing R and D support programs to ensure they are better adapted. It means credit for purchasers that buy aircraft from us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277807">Now, what do we want?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277808">I want to suggest some ideas that we could put forward and debate. However, we would have liked to have seen some initial thoughts on this in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277809">For example, there is recycling. To reduce the cost of keeping its planes airworthy, Air Canada removed 80 planes from its fleet. They are going to be sent to an aircraft boneyard in the Arizona desert. However, there is a company in Mirabel that dismantles and recycles planes. It is the only such company that is certified in North America. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277810">The accelerated removal of aircraft presents an opportunity if Ottawa decides to place environmental conditions on its assistance to airlines. This is in keeping with the very appropriate proposal put forward by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252574" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation>. Hundreds of technicians could continue to work in the field rather than having to seek work elsewhere until things take off again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277811">With regard to climate change, France put a condition on its seven-billion-euro bailout for Air France. Air France was told that the assistance was conditional on the preparation of a plan to make its fleet greener. If Ottawa had a similar program, it would guarantee sales of the A220, which is built in Mirabel and is the most fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft in its class. In Quebec, going green pays off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277812">I also want to talk about maintenance. Over the years, airlines have outsourced most of the heavy maintenance on their aircraft. The closure of the Air Canada maintenance centres in the late 2000s cost this country 3,600 jobs, 2,500 of which were in Quebec. Members will recall the Aveos saga. Today, those same airlines are knocking on the government's door looking for an aid package. We could take advantage of that to rebuild our industrial sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277813">Of course, they need cash flow too. We can expect major buyers to slow their activities during the crisis but to get through it eventually. Unfortunately, for the 200 SMEs in this sector that supply parts and components, the future is much less certain. If a supplier goes out of business, the part it supplies will not be available for planes. We are in danger of losing our ability to build an aircraft from nose to tail, which is something we are proud of and known for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277814">As I was saying, only three places in the world have that ability, and the greater Montreal area is one of them. The sector is highly integrated, so only an integrated policy will properly address its unique characteristics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277815">We need loans for buyers too. Airlines that have A220s are pretty much flying only those planes. Not only are they more fuel efficient, making them cheaper to fly, but they are also well suited to the pandemic. The A220 is the only plane that can replace the cabin air in flight. Other planes recycle their air. I am sure we can all agree that that is a priceless advantage during a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277816"> Airlines with no cash flow are not accepting delivery of the aircraft they ordered so that they do not have to pay the balance. The yard next to the plant in Mirabel is full. There are 16 aircraft parked there, ready for delivery, because the buyers cannot yet take possession. If they had credit, there is a good chance that they would do so. That would be a solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277817">We must also consider the defence sector. A number of businesses in the aerospace industry supply to both the civilian and defence sectors, in the areas of manufacturing and maintenance. Logically, the defence sector is less dependent on economic cycles than many other sectors. It provides more stable revenue, which helps companies through crises. Ottawa is preparing to replace its aging CF-18s. Strict local content requirements would give our industry a much-needed boost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277818">I also want to talk about research and development. The aerospace industry is very technology intensive. Designing an aircraft can take 10 to 15 years. The research and development of an aircraft is paid off in the years the aircraft is on the market. Under this business model, revenue pays for the previous research project, but what company is going to go into more debt to work on the next project? To reap the technological spinoffs, SMEs need to get in on a project during the early phases to design the part they will supply to the contract givers once the aircraft goes to market. They also need to incur debt in order to participate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277819">In times of crisis, research is the first thing a company will cut, since there is no immediate return on investment. This business decision makes complete sense. No one would disagree that the research and development tax credit is a good thing, but it does not generate cash flow in times of crisis. Direct assistance is required if we want to keep our companies from being downgraded once we emerge from this crisis. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277820">Of course, better tailored programs are needed. The research and development tax credit provides assistance for the development of a new product, but it is not available to those who want to improve an existing product. It should also be noted that this credit does not cover everything. For example, it does not cover costs such as—</ParaText>

We must understand that Canada is at a disadvantage compared to other countries such as France, the United States and Brazil, whose governments invest heavily in the aerospace and aviation industries through their military expenditures. That is not the case for Canadian companies. In those countries, the entire research and development process falls under military spending.

Well, it was not exactly empty; it was full of interference in areas under Quebec's jurisdiction, so I suppose it did have some content. Basically, we agree that the approach was unacceptable.</ParaText>

Today I am more proud of my hometown than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277849">Over the last six months, the strong sense of community that has propelled our city’s success over the last decade, with neighbours brought together by a shared purpose and pride of place, has been our strength and reassurance in a time of great uncertainty.</ParaText>

The key factor in our successful response has surely been our people: health care professionals who care for the sick, essential workers who put themselves at risk to keep the rest of us going, and neighbours helping neighbours.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277859">Of course we have not been entirely spared this terrible virus. Sadly, we mourn the loss of 65 Nova Scotians who succumbed to COVID-19. This number is too high. One person lost is too many. I want those families to know that our city holds them in our thoughts and in our hearts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277860"> We also know that we need to do better in our long-term care system in Nova Scotia. The province is actively working, with support from the federal government, to ensure that we have the equipment we need to protect the seniors who live in these facilities. After all, as governments rely on the hard work of everyday citizens to get through this crisis, citizens are relying on us, as government and parliamentarians, to lead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277861">That brings me to the government’s agenda, as laid out in the Speech from the Throne. It is difficult to believe it was only 10 months ago that we gathered in the red chamber to hear the speech that kicked off the first session of this 43rd Parliament. The world feels like a much different place than it did on that day last December and, in fact, very different from this time a year ago when I, and all of us, were on the campaign trail, asking Canadians for their trust. At the end of that campaign, Canadians re-elected our Liberal government for its strong record and our bold, hopeful plan for the future of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277862">In that election, Canadians looked at our achievements as a government, from creating a million new jobs, to enacting the strongest climate plan of any government in Canadian history; to our historic investments in community infrastructure, transit, and housing; to our important work on reconciliation, restoring Canada’s place on the world stage; and to the advancement of gender equality in all sectors of our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277863">Canadians looked at our record and they re-elected a Liberal government. They looked at our vision for the future: a net-zero-emissions future, ambitious conservation goals, national pharmacare, more affordable child care, more support for our seniors, lower taxes for clean tech, and continued investments in the communities that we call home. Canadians looked at our plan and they re-elected a Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277864">Yes, times have changed. Priorities have shifted, and new challenges have risen to the top, but I want all Canadians to know that we are that same government. We are the government with a strong record of results and a bold plan for the future. Now we are the government that has led Canada through the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also the government that will see us through to the other side, to a strong recovery and to brighter, sunnier days. In March, at the outset of the pandemic, we promised we would be there for Canadians. We have kept that promise.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277865">We put workers first with the Canada emergency response benefit, ensuring people had money to put food on the table and cover their bills. We provided small businesses with quick access to capital through the Canada emergency business account. We made sure people could keep their jobs and keep their businesses running with the Canada emergency wage subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277866">We topped up the GST credit, OAS and the Canada child benefit to help Canadians get by. We are helping people with disabilities with a special one-time payment. We have stepped up for charities and non-profits, and for cultural and heritage organizations. We have provided much-needed relief for the provinces and municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277867">Now, we find ourselves at a critical juncture, not only in the timeline of this pandemic, but in the history of Canada. Our next steps will determine the kind of Canada in which our parents will live out the rest of their lives, and the kind of Canada in which our kids will grow up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277868">We are at a crossroads, and the Speech from the Throne illuminates the path that leads toward progress and prosperity for Canada. It seeks to build a fairer Canada, where no one gets left behind or falls through the cracks; a more resilient and sustainable Canada, one that is clear-eyed about the challenge of climate change and what it will take to fight it; and a healthy Canada that protects and cares for its citizens, as we persevere through a deadly global pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277869">The Speech from the Throne lays the foundation for a once-in-a-generation, transformational shift in Canada to build toward a Canada-wide early learning and child care system; to set new, national standards for long-term care; to introduce a new Canadian disability benefit, invest more in housing and commit to entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277870">We are making the largest investment in Canadian history in training for workers, and making a commitment to create one million jobs. We are moving forward with the clean power fund, including projects like the Atlantic loop, which will connect surplus clean power to regions transitioning away from coal. We will modernize the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. We will continue the fight to dismantle systemic racism in our country through measures like law enforcement reform, including enhanced civilian oversight, modernized training and a shift to community policing. We promise all of this and more, on top of critical investments in public health to support our provincial partners through the COVID-19 pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277871">I mentioned earlier that Canadians put their trust in our record and in our plan when they re-elected the Liberal government last October. Of course, it is also true that we were returned to Parliament as a minority. The message to all parties was clear: Canadians want us to work together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277872">I hope Canadians see that, on this side of the House, we have heard their message loud and clear. As a government, we have worked respectfully and meaningfully with opposition parties on areas of shared interest. We have shown that we are a collaborative, flexible government that works with any party in the House that puts Canadians first, ahead of posturing and politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277873">Sadly, the Conservative opposition has chosen a different approach. They have chosen a self-serving agenda that seeks to tear down rather than build up. They would rather play games, and try to score political points, than work in the interests of Canadians. We have seen the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> push a divisive narrative that does nothing to bring our vast nation together in this time of crisis, choosing instead to disrespect the Canadians who sent us here to find common ground. He is choosing instead to begin his tenure as leader by planting seeds of division all across our country. He is choosing instead to leave the millions of hard-working, middle-class Canadians who voted for his party in the lurch as they have called out for help. He does this all because it served his party better to play politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277874">However, we have seen this cynical trick before, and Canadians will see through it. Instead, they will find pride in a Liberal government that is working hard for them, in partnership with other willing parties, to put their health first. We are working hard to keep families afloat, to fight climate change, to bring joy back to our streets and to build back better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277875">That is the plan we have outlined in the Speech from the Throne, and it will be a privilege to cast my vote on behalf of the good people of Halifax in favour of the hopeful vision it lays out for our country. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6277890">Madam Speaker, our government's throne speech and this debate come at a time when Canadians, and certainly those of us in Fleetwood—Port Kells, are paying more attention than usual to their governments. Of course, this is because these are exceedingly unusual times. These are times when we are experiencing a great reunderstanding of the role of government in the lives of our citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277891">Starting about 50 years ago, people in western Europe and most of the Americas looked for a new balance of influence, one that leaned toward smaller governments. This was after a long period during which those living through the Depression, the world war and recovery had seen national governments calling the shots on how the human, material and financial resources of the nation would be directed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277892">Now we find ourselves here, at a time when flaws in the free market and the weakness of globalization have shaken the ability of governments to maintain the resiliency needed to deal with the social and economic shocks of the pandemic. These have all combined to have us once again looking to government for leadership, ideas, the willingness to act and hope. That is what our government's Speech from the Throne intended to deliver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277893">We in Canada have certain advantages that have helped us manage the challenges this year has thrown at us. One of them is that, by and large, Canadians tend to believe in the power of the common good. We are generally prepared to set aside self-interest and assume some duty to act selflessly to help our neighbours. We know that when it is necessary, we draw lines in the sand and stand up for our values, principles and ideologies, because we honestly believe they represent the best direction for the country, but we have also demonstrated the good sense to set that all aside and pull together when efforts toward a common cause are needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277894">Our colleagues in the opposition have disagreed with some of the steps this government has taken in response to the social and economic damages inflicted by the pandemic, but when it really counted, the whole lot of us have worked to make our national response to the pandemic better. When so many countries have been torn by partisan political conflict, which stalled action in the public interest, Canadians have been able to count on us to act quickly. They understand the need to make course corrections as we go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277895">Another advantage we have is the lessons history has taught us in supporting Canadians in times like this. The economic shock we experienced this year looks very much like the sudden and drastic shock of the collapse of the stock markets in 1929, but our response this time is different. In the early 1930s, prime minister R. B. Bennett looked to Conservative ideology and decided that austerity was the right strategy. That served only to deepen the breadth and depth of the misery Canadians experienced in the so-called Great Depression. My parents lived through it and, believe me, there was nothing great about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277896">In 2008, unchecked excesses in our financial markets had the world teetering on economic collapse. This time, though, the Canadian government and prime minister Stephen Harper reacted in an un-Conservative way, going into deficit to stimulate the economy and take up some of the economic slack. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277897">There are, however, some things to learn from that experience, too. While Canadians escaped the kind of suffering experienced by our neighbours to the south, the malaise was not cured. Indeed, by the summer of 2015, Canada was still technically in a recession and unemployment was stubbornly high. Mr. Harper had reassumed his conservatism and believed that balancing the budget was what the country needed. His stimulus was too little, and it ended too soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277898">This time, the government has had the benefit of those experiences, and what we have learned, we have applied, but more than that, the strategies we brought to government in 2015 have served as a major advantage for Canada. Those deficits we recorded from 2015 to 2019 were not a response to an economic emergency. They were funding investments and, like all good investments, they delivered dividends. The total deficit in the first term was about $60 billion. Canada's GDP grew by just over $180 billion. If we like, we could claim a 300% return on that investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277899">Unlike the Conservative stimulus package in 2008-09, which funded projects across the country, the deficits in our first term were divided between infrastructure expansion designed to increase Canada's productivity and the economic well-being of Canadian families. </ParaText>

We should not overlook what the Canada child benefit has meant to families in these tough times.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277901">Our economic performance from 2015 to 2019 included the creation of over a million new jobs, real wage growth for the first time in a decade or more, hundreds of thousands of people lifted out of poverty and, by the way, a lift in government revenues, all without raising taxes and the program cuts that define the Harper years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277902">Something else we learned coming into the pandemic is that growing the economy and working to share the wealth more equitably means families and governments alike can do more. The things we learned, the things we proved prior to and after the pandemic shutdown in March, are now helping Canadians through another round of tough times, so let us recap them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277903">First, from the response to the stock market crash in 1929, we know this is not the time for austerity. Members may recall this being mentioned in the throne speech. From the response to the financial collapse in 2008, we learned we have to commit to doing what it takes to help Canadians and to take the country through recovery and beyond. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277904">We have proven that support focused on helping middle-class families and the families struggling to get to the middle class does more to deliver well-being, confidence and hope than tax cuts for big business and the wealthy. A strong middle class is good for everybody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277905">All of us in this place have proven that when the welfare of the country is on the line, we are all team Canada, where a good idea does not care who has it. The quick delivery of benefits is critical. We cannot let perfection be the enemy of good. We have learned that while globalization has done much to lift the prospects of people across the world, we cannot count on it when nations act in their own natural self-interest and fail other nations that depend on them for vitally needed products, such as masks, gowns and gloves. Sovereignty means self-reliance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277906">We knew that ignoring the problem of conditions in long-term care facilities would come back to haunt us. Some lessons are hard to learn and come too late. As a government, we know that our ability to fund the support Canadians need at historically low interest rates is far better than the ability of families that would have no alternative to credit card debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277907">Even adding on the borrowing for pandemic supports, low interest rates today mean Canada's annual debt servicing costs are billions of dollars lower than they were last fall. We can and have locked in these historically low rates for decades, and this makes sense for the nation when families would pay 19% interest on credit card balances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277908">We know that, with some notable exceptions, Canadians will do what is necessary for the sake of their neighbours and the good of the country. Social distancing, wearing masks and not holding big parties are not onerous gestures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277909">There is one other thing we know. We have an opportunity, one that this government believes we must take now, to reformat our post-pandemic economy. We are wasting too many valuable human resources in Canada with so many of us working precariously in the so-called gig economy. We can do better than re-establishing those conditions. We cannot pass on the opportunity to build and bolster in a number of sections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277910">That includes the low-carbon economy. The major oil companies get it. They are leading the transition in many cases. Our government's support for Canada's energy sector must build on that for the sake of good jobs in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and northeast B.C., and for the sake of our climate and the future of life on this planet. This too was incorporated into the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277911">Help will be on the way for our tourism and hospitality sectors. Our commitment to a national pharmacare program still stands. Family reunification is a priority, more important than ever in such an uncertain world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277912">Like all throne speeches, the one we heard last week provided the country with a strong commitment to deal with the challenges of the day and a high-level vision for where we think the nation needs to go. Day by day, the details are emerging on programs that signal our commitment to do what it takes to protect the health of Canadians, our communities and our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277913">The next step is to build on the foundation we have laid over the past five years to realize the full value of our natural national advantages. If members listened carefully they would have heard the essential elements of leadership, creativity, collaboration, flexibility, resiliency and thoughtfulness. These are not the exclusive property of the party in power. This is what Canadians have a right to expect from all of us in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277914">Yes, we will have different ideas about what to do and how to do them. Canadians will benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas, but the signals we send to our citizens must unfailingly give them not just the hope but also the confidence that their Parliament will work as a community of purpose for their common good.</ParaText>

For example, is it up to the federal government to decide how many health care providers work in our long-term care facilities? Is it up to the federal government to dictate delivery of care to the provinces? No. In our opinion, the federal government's role is to transfer in a sustainable way the money needed to meet these health care needs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277925">Madam Speaker, the government has had some foreign policy accomplishments. It has continued Operation Reassurance in eastern Europe and Operation Unifier in Ukraine, both military missions that we support. In trade, the new USMCA was concluded, a mostly defensive outcome that will see drop of 0.4% in real GDP relative to NAFTA, as outlined by the C.D. Howe Institute. A trade agreement with the European Union was also concluded, but, it must be said, it was largely negotiated under the previous government. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, also largely negotiated under the previous government, was concluded, but it was almost upended by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who failed to show up at a meeting for 10 heads of government at the APEC summit in Vietnam in November 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277926">However, whatever hope Canada had in starting trade talks with India was lost in the embarrassing antics of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> during his eight-day trip to the world's fifth-largest economy. So, too, it was with trade talks with China, when he opened with a progressive proposal on the environment, labour and gender rights, all non-starters for China. The deal was over before it had even begun.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277927">In general, the government's foreign policy has been a disappointment. The Speech from the Throne does nothing to change that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277928">The government came to office with a big commitment to resurrect Canadian peacekeeping.</ParaText>

As in many other cases with this government, these efforts were made for only a short time, barely a year. The government then lost interest in helping this country, as well as the political will to do so.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6277930">Now, just one year after the mission has ended, there has been a coup in Mali, with the government replaced by a military junta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277931">The previous foreign minister mentioned the rise of populism and distrust of the global economy as one of the two big challenges in foreign policy. She pointed at her government's economic plan as a solution. After five years in power, we can judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277932">The Canadian economy was in trouble before the pandemic had hit, with record-high levels of household debt. The OECD and the IMF predict that we will have a deeper recession and a slower recovery than our economic peers, an economy with the highest unemployment in the G7 and a middle class that is further behind today than it was in 2015. Under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canada has become less prosperous, less united and less respected on the world stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277933">The government came to office in 2015, telling the world that Canada is back, but the facts say otherwise. Canada lost its vote for the UN Security Council seat last June. It got 108 votes, six fewer than it got a decade ago. That is six fewer countries in the world today that see Canada as a leader on the global stage. That is a quantitative and identifiable indictment of the current government's foreign policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277934">The government came to office saying it was going to make Canada a global leader in helping the poorest around the world. The opposite has happened. Under the current government, official development assistance has declined. Under the previous Conservative government, ODA averaged 0.3% of GDP for the 10 years that government was in office. During the current government, it has averaged 0.27%, a 10% decline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277935">Bob Rae called out the government on its failure in foreign aid in a damning indictment. About Canada's ODA target number, he said, “Canada has never come close to that number, and if our rate this year looks slightly better than last year's, it is only because the GNI number is stagnant, if not declining. Despite this record, Canadians think of their country as generous, and deeply engaged on the international front.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277936">On climate change, the current government has been a disappointment. It came to office promising to do better, but the facts say otherwise. In 2016, the first full year the current government was in office, emissions were 708 megatonnes. In 2018, the last year for which we have data, emissions jumped to 729 megatonnes. Canada's emissions are increasing, yet the government said in the Speech from the Throne that it will not only meet the Paris targets, it will exceed them. Yet again, another yawning gap between rhetoric and reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277937">The Liberal government's foreign policy has been incoherent and inconsistent. For example, China is not upholding its responsibility to the rules-based international system. It is ignoring its condition of entry into the WTO. It interferes through its state-owned enterprises. It infringes on intellectual property, and it engages in cyberwarfare. It violates human rights in international treaties in its treatment of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the Uighurs and the people of Hong Kong. In short, it is threatening our interests and our values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277938"> In that context, it is really important that the government speak with a consistent, coherent voice. Unfortunately, that is not happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277939">In July, the <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> told this House that he was looking at sanctions on Chinese officials, and a day later the government told Reuters that is off the table. Just two weeks ago, the <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> told the Globe that trade talks with China were off the table, the same day Ambassador Barton said that we should expand trade and do more in China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277940">These are some of many examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277941">The government acknowledges its China policy is broken. That is why it is supposed to come forward this fall with a new framework, but I am not confident it is going to address the problem. Here is why. Foreign policy starts with who we are. It is about our projection abroad of what we are all about. The problem is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said that Canada has no core identity, that we are just a collection of different groups, that we are the first post-national state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277942">I could not disagree more. Canada is not simply a collection of different groups with no common identity or common purpose. We as Canadians are some 37 million citizens who live on the north half of this vast continent, who share together a common identity and common purpose, a shared citizenship, rooted in our two official languages, our shared history, our collective institutions and our future together. That is who we are as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277943">The problem with the Liberals' foreign policy is, if they do not know who they are, then their foreign policy will reflect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277944">Let me finish by saying this: foreign affairs matter. I know this first-hand. At the start of the Second World War, a young Chinese boy was defended by Canadian soldiers in Hong Kong. Half of them died or were wounded. At the end of that same war, a young Dutch girl was liberated by Canadian soldiers in the Netherlands. Some 7,500 of their comrades never came back home, and died in the canals, the fields and the villages of the Netherlands. That Dutch girl and that Chinese boy were my parents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277945">They came to Canada in search of a better life. They believed in Canada. They believe in our nation's ability, generation after generation, to look beyond a person's colour or their creed, to harness their ambition to build a better Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277961">Unless I am mistaken, I am not sure I heard my colleague's views on Canada's relationship with Saudi Arabia. He mentioned some of the very serious transgressions of human rights in the world. With Saudi Arabia, we have an absolute monarchy. Not only is it not a democracy, it does not even allow its citizens to vote. It is a known misogynist country. It is interfering in neighbouring Yemen, where we have maybe the largest humanitarian catastrophe on the planet, with children starving and civilians being bombed. We know that the Saudi Arabian government was responsible for murdering a journalist in Europe.</ParaText>

The government has been inconsistent in upholding those obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277964">The member mentioned Saudi Arabia, but there is another present example this week of Turkey. A year ago, the government halted exports of military equipment to Turkey out of concern that it was failing to uphold its obligations as a NATO member. Last April/May, it reinstated the approvals for those permits, and exports have allegedly gone to Turkey. These are being used in Azerbaijan in the conflict currently unfolding in the Caucasus. Then several days ago it reversed course yet again and put another halt to the export permits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6277966">Madam Speaker, I want to give a shout-out to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252827" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>. I congratulate him on his fantastic speech. I have had the honour of serving with him for over five years now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277967">This is a unique situation. We are in a hybrid situation. I am speaking from my hometown of Williams Lake, where I am very proud to be from, in my riding of Cariboo—Prince George.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277968">I could comment a lot on the Speech from the Throne, but as October 4 to 10 is Mental Illness Awareness Week, it has provided us a unique opportunity to view this global pandemic through the mental health lens. Now more than ever we need to turn our focus and see mental health in parity with physical health. Looking at COVID, the Speech from the Throne fell short in many ways, and I will focus my speech on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277969">I want to take members back to January 27 when I first raised the issue of COVID-19 with the government, and I was summarily dismissed by the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>. I was told that it was not an issue. I and my Conservative colleagues and other colleagues from the opposition were fearmongering. I was wrong to suggest that we needed to do more as a country. I was wrong to suggest that we needed to really focus. We were taking a non-partisan approach and we were challenging the government to look at and prepare us for what was eventually to come. The warning signs were there. The opposition saw it. I am not quite sure why the government did not see it coming. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277970">We know that prolonged isolation and physical distancing have a detrimental effect on mental health. From personal experience, the effects of this pandemic have been extremely detrimental. Our colleagues on all sides, and who are speaking all across our country, are hearing heartbreaking stories. They are talking with their constituents who are losing their businesses. Not only do they have their financial stressors, they also have their health stressors that are adding to increased anxiety. We need to be better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277971">A very serious issue with COVID has been raised, and it is our seniors. My father-in-law has been diagnosed with cancer. Early in May, we moved him to our home for palliative care. The end is near for my father-in-law. COVID has been both a blessing and a curse. We have the chance to spend an increased amount of time with him, time that most Canadians do not have. However, the stress on everyday Canadians and what we have seen in seniors care facilities across our country is shocking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277972">It is not the case for a majority of Canadians. We know that many Canadians are not as fortunate as we are, for example, for me to bring my father-in-law into our home. We have seen cases on social media as well as in the news where loved ones have had to watch at a distance. They have not had the opportunity to spend those final moments with their loved ones who are in senior care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277973"> Unfortunately, we know that seniors 50-plus are at a higher risk of COVID as well as mental illness and mental injury. Those who are 60 and 70 years of age are even at a higher risk. We are failing this important community in our nation. Underlying medical conditions put seniors at a higher risk. As high as eight out of 10 deaths related to COVID are seniors over 65. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277974">Another important segment are those people who are living with deadly illnesses such as ALS. I had the honour to meet with one of my constituents, Deane Gorsline. Deane was a young man serving in our Canadian Armed Forces. At the age of 29, he was struck with ALS. Just a couple of weeks ago, I met with him and his group, the ALS Action Canada organization.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6277975">The group shared with us that those who were living with these deadly diseases were suffering devastating impacts because of COVID. Some members in the chamber will remember our colleague, Mauril Bélanger, and the speed at which the disease wracked his body. It quickly took away his ability to communicate and it quickly took him from us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277976">We have all suffered through this pandemic, but those suffering life-threatening diseases are at a greater risk of physical and mental illness. Without access to hospital services, chronic health problems can worsen. Changes in sleeping and eating patterns can be detrimental to their mental health. Isolation, loneliness and increased anxiety are all factors in someone's mental well-being. We know that increased isolation and physical distancing leads to increased anxiety and high stress. It also leads to substance abuse, increased domestic violence and suicidal crises. We need to be better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277977">When I looked at the Speech from the Throne, I was hopeful. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament for six weeks. I was hopeful that it really was a reset. Instead we saw much of the same that had experienced over the first year of last session and the four years previous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277978">There was not much in the Speech from the Throne on mental health. Essentially, it was two lines. The first was that the government would further increase access to mental health resources for all Canadians. If they have the care they need when they need it, we will all be stronger for it. We need to ensure that whether it is somebody struggling with mental illness or injury in Newfoundland or British Columbia, we need to have consistent care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277979"> It is shocking for me to hear comments from ministers of the Crown, such as the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>, who make light of PTSD. That further minimizes and stigmatizes those who are struggling and suffering silently in the shadows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277980">The second mention in the Speech from the Throne about mental health was, “Expediting work to co-develop distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation, and a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy.” We all need to ensure we build awareness, but we also need action. I was looking for that. The stakeholder groups that I have met with in the last few weeks since the Speech from the Throne all say the same thing. It is not enough to create hope; we have to create action. That was missing in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277981">This is really shameful. Now more than ever we need a plan for recovery. We did not see that. We saw more platitudes in the over 7,000 words in the Speech from the Throne. I think Canadians across the country were looking for an economic plan and a recovery plan, and that has to include mental health. Right now more than ever we need that. We need a plan that will not leave seniors behind. We need a plan that will not further alienate those living with deadly illnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277982"> The Liberals are talking a good game, but are not doing enough. The Speech from the Throne is a failure. Seniors, like my father-in-law, will drop through the cracks if we do not change course very soon. What happens to seniors who do not have families like ours? What happens if families do not have the opportunity to move their loved ones into their homes for end-of-life care? What happens to a family who cannot afford to take on that extra responsibility?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277983">Those suffering with ALS and diseases like it need special care and consideration when developing plans for second and third waves of COVID. We are well into the second wave at this point, or just entering it, but we need to be thinking about that third wave. We need to do better and we must.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6277984">We also know that two to three years after a major crisis, such as the wildfires in Fort McMurray or in B.C., there is an increase in suicides, domestic violence and socio-economic issues such as alcohol and substance abuse. We need to have a plan to combat that. We can do better and we must do better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6278000">It is a pleasure to be here today, virtually from Surrey, B.C., during these extraordinary times. I am honoured to have this opportunity to speak on the Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278001">The coronavirus pandemic has changed the world as we know it. We find ourselves with the remarkable opportunity to make our country, and our world, a better place than it was before. We have the opportunity to build back better, to make sure Canadians have the support and resources they need to feel safe and to get through anything that may arise in the coming months and years. By making sure we support Canadians today and tomorrow, we are ensuring the success of our great country. The four pillars of the Speech from the Throne lay a road map for just that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278002">The last few months have been an incredible challenge in so many ways, but we have come far since the beginning of the pandemic. As we begin to see signs of the second wave in parts of the country, we need to remain vigilant. We must all continue to do our part by listening to the expert advice of our public health officials, keeping our social circles small, physically distancing from each other, wearing masks when keeping a two-metre distance from others is not possible, and practising good hand hygiene. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278003">Canada fared well in the first wave. Our hospitals did not become overwhelmed, and individuals did their part by staying home. We were able to keep our case numbers manageable compared with many other countries around the world. We know so much more about the spread of the virus now than we did in the early days of the pandemic. We know how important testing and contact tracing are. My incredibly hard-working and dedicated colleagues and their teams have been working around the clock to make sure that Canadians have access to PPE, testing kits and, in the future, vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278004">So far we have approved 36 tests, including two that are point-of-care, to help with rapid testing in specific populations, such as rural and remote communities. The Vaccine Task Force is helping the government with the procurement of new vaccine candidates. Just last week, Health Canada announced that it had received its first submission for authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278005">Half of our country's PPE needs are now being manufactured domestically, compared with nearly none a few months ago. We saw incredible resourcefulness and innovation across the country. Breweries and distilleries have restructured to make hand sanitizer, clothing companies are making gowns and face masks, and sporting goods companies are making face shields. In my own community, Surrey-based Central City Brewers and Distillers began producing hand sanitizer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278006">We have been working closely with the provinces and territories from the outset to acquire PPE, making sure Canadians and businesses had the support they needed to weather the storm. Over the summer, our government announced the $19 billion safe restart agreement with the provinces, and an additional $2 billion for the safe return to class fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278007">We are working hard to restore employment levels to what they were pre-pandemic. We created one million new jobs before, and we will do it again. However, we know that, even with the continued positive news from recent labour force surveys and the return of many jobs, there are still a lot of Canadians without work who continue to struggle. Nearly nine million Canadians received support from the Canada emergency response benefit and 3.5 million were supported by the Canada emergency wage subsidy. I know from speaking with many of my constituents in Surrey Centre that these benefits, and the measures introduced earlier on, were vital to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278008">To help Canadians return to the workforce, we will create direct investments in the social sector and infrastructure, immediate training to quickly skill up workers, and incentives for employers to retain workers. This will be vital to our energy sector workers as we transition to a greener and more sustainable economy so we are able to meet our environmental goals and slow climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278009">We also know that youth across the country have had a particularly challenging time, facing the loss of job prospects. We will scale up the youth employment strategy to create more jobs for young people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278010">While we work to return these jobs to address the continued needs of Canadians, we have begun transitioning many Canadians back to an expanded EI and have created the new Canada recovery benefit, Canada recovery caregiver benefit and Canada recovery sickness benefit. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6278011">We have also extended the wage subsidy until next summer so employers can keep their employees on the payroll. My community has many small and medium-sized businesses that have been relying on the wage subsidy, the Canada emergency business account and the business credit availability program to keep afloat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278012">To further assist small and medium-sized businesses, we recently announced $600 million in addition to the $962 million in funding already allocated for the regional relief and recovery fund. This funding will especially help industries related to events and tourism, including banquet halls, caterers and hotels in Surrey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278013">We continue to work with local organizations that know the needs of their communities best. Recently, the Surrey Board of Trade received $50,000 in funding for business economic recovery services, and SurreyCares Community Foundation has been distributing thousands of dollars in grants to local organizations through the federal emergency community support fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278014">The pandemic has shone a spotlight on the inequalities in our country. Women, especially low-income women and women of colour, have been hit hard by job losses. They have left jobs to care for their children or relatives, or are more likely to be working on the front lines in low-wage positions. We will be creating the action plan for women in the economy to make sure that the gains women have fought so hard for, socially and politically, do no reverse. We know the importance and benefits of having equal representation in our workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278015">Throughout the course of the pandemic, we have been assisting parents with child care support, including the additional $300-per-child payment as part of the Canada child benefit. We will continue to give parents access to affordable, high-quality and inclusive child care. We know this is needed in order to make sure that women have the opportunity to get back to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278016">We can no longer say we did not know. We know the struggles faced by Canadians. There has been grief and worry, and our government will continue to address the needs of our most vulnerable. These gaps in our social system need to be closed. In 2020, it is unacceptable that we continue to have members of our communities being left behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278017">We will build our communities back stronger and more resilient than before by investing in infrastructure like public transit, energy efficient retrofits, clean energy, rural broadband and affordable housing, particularly for indigenous peoples and northern communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278018">For seniors, we will continue to work with the provinces and territories to set new national standards for long-term care so seniors get the best support possible. We will also ensure those who mistreat and neglect seniors will be penalized, by working with Parliament to change the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278019">The disability inclusion plan will include a new benefit modelled around the GIS and create a better process to determine eligibility for government disability programs and benefits. Our government has been committed to achieving national, universal pharmacare and we will be working with the provinces and territories to ensure we move quickly to create it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278020">We also know the inequalities we are seeing in our society are not only a result of the coronavirus pandemic. They have much deeper roots in systemic racism and discrimination. Visible minorities in Canada are hurting, and have been hurting for years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278021">We are committed to walking the shared path of reconciliation with indigenous peoples by accelerating work on the national action plan and on the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action, as well as continuing to close the infrastructure gap in indigenous communities and working on a distinctions basis with first nations, Inuit and the Métis nation to accelerate the government’s 10-year commitment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278022">We will continue to support racialized Canadians. The Parliamentary Black Caucus has championed these rights, and their advocacy is reflected in the Speech from the Throne. The Black entrepreneurship program will ensure that those who face systemic racism and discrimination have access to tools for economic empowerment and increase the diversity in procurement. There is still a lot work to do, but we are moving in the right direction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278023">We have seen how coming together in the House and in our communities has benefited Canadians. We are still very much in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, and now is not the time to let our guard down. Cynicism and fear did not get us through the first wave and it will not get us through the second. The only way forward is through working together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278024">Most encouraging, though, is all the organizations that have contributed to a team Canada style support for their neighbours. Here in Surrey, Kiran Saluja and her volunteers at the Sewing Army, an organization of 18 seniors, made over 15,000 masks from their homes and gave them to non-profits and those in need.</ParaText>

One lady suffered through cancer and survived it, started a business and lost that business because of COVID-19. Just last week, she started yet another business. This is the kind of courage and relentless risk-taking that will bring back our country, stronger.

It is the entrepreneurs in small and medium-sized businesses and Canadians who have stepped up in this pandemic, whether it was to make PPE, to help neighbours or to help those who were quarantined by getting them necessary supplies, medicine and food. Seniors who wanted to help took out their old sewing machines and made masks for non-profits that could not afford them or avail themselves of them. Distilleries, as I said, stopped production to make sure that Canada had enough hand sanitizer.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6278066">Mr. Speaker, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, or the IPU, is a critically important international organization. It has been described as the United Nations of parliaments. Essentially, it is an organization of legislators that brings together parliamentarians from around the world. It plays an important role in helping to advance democracy and human rights through dialogue among different parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278067">I am very pleased to share with the House something I think members already know, in large part, which is that Senator Salma Ataullahjan, who has been involved in the IPU for a very long time and has used the IPU as a forum for advancing important human rights issues, is running for the presidency of that organization. I am very pleased that all members of our Conservative caucus are supporting her bid to lead the IPU. I know she has a great deal of support in other parties, including, for instance, within the government caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278068">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252591" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> told The Globe and Mail, “While we represent different parties, I’ve seen firsthand Salma’s thoughtful diplomacy at IPU conferences, and our Parliament would be lucky to have her represent Canada on the world stage”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278069">The Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="252608" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation> concurred. He told The Globe and Mail, “Salma would be a great leader of the IPU. It is good for Canada and for what our country represents.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278070">Senator Ataullahjan was encouraged to run for the leadership of the IPU by delegates from Britain and New Zealand. I know she has substantial support around the world for this bid. It would be good for Canada to have this prominent Canadian senator, a strong advocate of human rights, representing Canadian values on the world stage, bringing together and strengthening the work of the IPU, and continuing to use that as a forum to advance important issues of justice and human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278071">Independent senator, Mohamed-Iqbal Ravalia said that Ms. Ataullahjan is a “beacon of human rights and inclusive values…and as a Muslim woman, she will raise the profile of Canada’s place in the IPU.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278072">I would just say as well that Senator Ataullahjan has an extensive background in volunteering in various communities. She served on the executive board of the Canadian branch of the Citizens Foundation, an international organization that has built over 700 schools for Pakistan's poorest children. Senator Ataullahjan was appointed to the Senate by former prime minister Stephen Harper and was the first Canadian senator of Pakistani origin appointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278073">Senator Ataullahjan and I have had an opportunity to collaborate specifically on the issue of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. She put forward Bill <Document DbId="9206308" Type="4">S-240</Document> in the last Parliament, which almost got passed but did not quite make it, and has since put forward Bill <Document DbId="10873542" Type="4">S-204</Document> in this Parliament, another critically important human rights issue that just adds to a long list of the work of Senator Ataullahjan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278074">This is a great opportunity for Canada to have a strong Canadian senator representing us at the Inter-Parliamentary Union in this important leadership role. It is important, therefore, for the government to get behind this bid and show its support because I know countries around the world are looking for that signal of support from the government, from our diplomatic representatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278075"> It is very clear that the government has put the resources of government at the disposal of former finance minister Bill Morneau in his bid for a position within the OECD, and it is only right that Senator Ataullahjan have the support of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278076">We disagree in this place on issues from time to time, of course, but we should be able to work together on the world stage to advance our national interests. Conservatives were supportive, as supportive as we could be, of the government's bid to get on the UN Security Council. We try to work together in these international fora, yet the government has been strangely silent around the bid of Senator Ataullahjan. The minister said he is going to wait, he is going to meet with future candidates later on, and so on and so forth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278077">It is important for the <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> to send a clear signal of support for Senator Ataullahjan's bid for that strong Canadian voice on the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The minister and the parliamentary secretary have an opportunity right now to express that support, and I think it is very important that they do so.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6278078">Madam Speaker, it is very important that we start out by getting some facts on the table here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278079">We are standing in the House, or speaking remotely as the case may be, as parliamentarians to discuss the Inter-Parliamentary Union: an international organization made up of parliamentarians like us, like you Madam Speaker, and all the members from 179 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278080">The IPU is an important international organization that I joined when I became a member in 2008. I am very disappointed that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252804" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> is not a member of the IPU. I checked the membership today and was very disappointed that he does not have the confidence in the IPU that 85 people, senators and members of Parliament, have expressed by joining it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278081">The IPU is an interparliamentary association. It is not an intergovernmental association. It is very important to understand this is not a governmental organization. It is a long-standing practice that government does not interfere or intervene in our 12 parliamentary associations. This is very important to keep the independence of our parliamentary organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278082">I was the co-chair of one of our 12 associations for five years, and I appreciated our independence from government. I appreciated it, and in fact would expect or demand it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278083">This does not mean that the government does not wish the senator well in her campaign: in fact we do. The <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has spoken to her about her candidacy already, and will be doing so again. I have known Senator Ataullahjan for many years. I respect her greatly, both her work here in Ottawa and in the Greater Toronto Area, where we both come from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278084">I respect the work that she does and the issues she raises on human rights, equality, gender equity and anti-racism. However, the accusation that there is anything related to gender in the government following a long-standing practice on inter-parliamentary organizations is without any basis whatsoever. It is irrelevant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278085">What I would hope is that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252804" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> would actually join the IPU, would recognize the importance of it, and also cherish the independence of it. Our government is proud of our inter-parliamentary associations and the work they contribute internationally and domestically. We will continue to do that while we continue to support gender equity, making sure that our cabinet and organizations are always treated with the utmost respect and ensuring that we have equality and justice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6278086">Madam Speaker, there might be something fair in that reproof in that I have been so busy critiquing the disastrous policy record of the government over the last five years that I just have not had time to fully engage in all of the parliamentary associations I might well have wished to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278087">If the government stops keeping me busy with all these flaws and problems in its legislative agenda, I might find time to get more engaged in some of these other areas, but that is really sort of beside the point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278088">The important point here is that it is very legitimate, and I think it is important, for our <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> to send a clear signal. Without a doubt it is a signal that the government has been prepared to send in other cases, such as that involving the former finance minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278089">I hope this is not about partisanship or about looking for excuses. It would not take much for the <Affiliation DbId="253367" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> to send that signal and to work with our diplomatic representatives to say that we want to ensure strong Canadian representation, and a strong Canadian voice on the world stage. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6278094">Madam Speaker, I hope that the adjournment debate will help clarify some things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278095">First, I would like to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues who are here in the House. The Bloc Québécois team is the biggest team in the House this evening. I am very pleased to see them here. They say it is always the best who leave first, but that is not true in this case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278096">Last Wednesday, during question period, I asked the government some questions about why there is no real policy in this regard. Of course, there has been some sporadic assistance, given at certain times, a little bit of money allocated on an ad hoc basis. However, the real question is, why is there no real policy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278097">Why is this industry not mentioned in the throne speech? It seems to me that a post-pandemic throne speech should mention the industries that are struggling. Unfortunately, the answers were completely unsatisfactory. The government said, among other things, that it was working hard for Canadians. However, we would like the government to make real commitments regarding the aerospace industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278098">My humble opinion is that Canada could learn from Quebec when it comes to the aerospace industry. Quebec could serve as an inspiration, since it has had an aerospace policy for nearly 20 years. On top of that, it offers specialized workforce training, makes risk-sharing investments in major projects, offers a tax credit that is more appropriate for the sector than federal programs, and offers support to SMEs in the aerospace sector to help them integrate into their clients' supply chains. It has an integrated policy that has supported the development of the entire cluster. Since the sector is undergoing a radical transformation and is in a critical phase given the dismantling of Bombardier, Quebec is currently reviewing its policy, and consultations are under way. It is taking a proactive approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278099">Still, there are certain things that a province cannot do alone. Ottawa needs to get on the same page. Sad to say, all we get now is radio silence. Any time we ask a question about it, we get no answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278100">The aerospace industry is struggling, and it deserves real support. All members know that this is a massive and very important industry that includes 220 businesses in Quebec, 200 of which are SMEs. Since small businesses are the lifeblood of economic development in Quebec, we must give them all the support they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278101">The context of the pandemic has come up often. A number of people have talked about planes being grounded and no orders being placed. This will probably not change for a long while. During the pandemic, 4,000 jobs were lost in the aerospace industry. In some cases, the federal support, such as the research and development tax credit or the Canada emergency wage subsidy, were not in tune with the reality. We, of course, fully supported the Canada emergency wage subsidy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278102">All of this shows that the aerospace industry has completely fallen off of Ottawa's radar. This major, crucial industry tends to be left out when the government is developing programs that should be adapted in a pandemic.</ParaText>

In fact, as I am sure the member is fully aware, green aviation is an area where Canada is truly a global powerhouse. To be more specific, the two aircraft in the world that have environmental product designations are assembled right here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278111">We know that aerospace is one of the most innovative and export-driven industries in Canada. It contributed over $25 billion in gross domestic product and more than 210,000 jobs to the Canadian economy in 2018. The aerospace industry is also the number one research and development player among all Canadian manufacturing industries, with an R and D investment of $1.5 billion in 2018, representing, I might add, approximately a quarter of all manufacturing R and D undertaken in Canada. The industry is national in scope, with important aerospace clusters in each region of the country, comprised of maintenance work, suppliers or large manufacturers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278112">Canada, in other words, is an innovative global leader in the aerospace industry, and we know that Quebeckers, and indeed Canadians across the country, rightfully take enormous pride in this sector. Our government has provided significant funding since 2015 to support the aerospace and space industries through innovation programs, including of course the strategic innovation fund. These key investments are driving ongoing advancements in this sector as it transitions to be cleaner, more innovative and more competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278113">Our funding, in turn, has leveraged significant private sector investments to better position the aerospace industry in Canada.

              <ParaText id="6278115">Madam Speaker, unfortunately, that answer confirms what I feared. The member said the aerospace industry is important, but then he just repeated many of the statistics I included in my own remarks. I appreciate that, and I thank my colleague, but there is still the matter of turning that into a policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278116">The hon. parliamentary secretary replied that the government has invested money and that there are broad programs for struggling companies. We know that, but this industry deserves a specific program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278117">Why not do what Ottawa did for the auto industry and come up with a proper policy? Why not start by sitting down with all the stakeholders, including workers, companies and the Government of Quebec, which is a very important stakeholder and partner, and designing a real policy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278118">There are also a lot of programs that should be targeted, and we need a cohesive vision around that. Basically, the government needs to treat this as a truly strategic industry because, quite honestly, Canada is one of only countries in the world that has a real aerospace industry but does not treat it as such.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6278121">Madam Speaker, Canada failed to protect long-term care residents from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 840 outbreaks were reported in long-term care facilities and retirement homes across Canada, accounting for more than 80% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. This represents the worst record of all comparable countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278122">The situation was so dire that Canadian Forces had to be called in to long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario. Residents there were found underfed, abandoned and afraid. In some cases, they had been left to die alone in bed covered in their own urine and feces. These stories shocked our conscience and challenged our self-image as a compassionate and humane society. However, they were entirely foreseeable and avoidable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278123">Experts and advocates have been raising an alarm over the state of Canada's long-term care sector for many years, but successive federal governments have failed to act. Indeed, decades of research have demonstrated that insufficient staff-to-resident ratios and the reliance on precarious working conditions have led to hurried, dehumanizing care, high staff turnover and workforce instability in the Canadian long-term care sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278124">British Columbia's long-term care system entered the pandemic with several advantages because the NDP provincial government had made progress on these issues prior to the outbreak despite the void of federal leadership. This included implementing measures to promote better coordination between long-term care, public health and hospitals; increased funding for long-term care; fewer shared rooms; and more comprehensive inspections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278125">Moreover, Premier Horgan acted early in the pandemic to limit long-term care workers to a single facility to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Before the pandemic, workers were forced to pick up shifts at multiple facilities that paid differing and insufficient wages. However, the B.C. government has spent more than $10 million a month to level up the wages and benefits of long-term care workers so that they earn a standard income no matter where they work. Premier Horgan has pledged to make this increase permanent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278126">As Canada sits on the crest of a second wave of COVID-19 and outbreaks in long-term care facilities are flaring up once again, residents remain at extreme risk due to continued federal inaction. In order to prevent another catastrophe, Canada's leading scientists and scholars are calling on the government to act immediately to implement binding national standards of care tied to new federal funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278127">In its recent throne speech, the government did pledge to “work with the provinces and territories to set new, national standards for long-term care”. However, it failed to provide a timeline for action or a commitment to new federal funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278128">Can the Liberal government confirm whether binding national standards and funding tied to meeting these standards for long-term care will be in place in time to protect vulnerable residents from the second wave of COVID-19?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6278129">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Vancouver Kingsway for his excellent question.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6278130">One of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is the lives lost in long-term care facilities. Like all Canadians, we are alarmed by the events that have occurred. In a country like ours, we should not need to call in soldiers to look after our seniors, as my colleague mentioned in his introduction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278131">The pandemic has highlighted the challenges that the long-term care sector has faced for many years. It has also highlighted the essential work done by personal support workers across the country who deserve greater recognition for the contributions they make to our society. While long-term care is regulated by the provincial and territorial governments, the federal government works with the provinces and territories to ensure the safety of residents and staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278132"> Under the new COVID-19 resilience stream of the investing in Canada program, federal infrastructure funding can be used to modernize long-term care homes, making them more resilient to ensure the safety of seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278133">The safe restart agreement has invested $740 million in infection prevention and control measures in long-term care homes and among other vulnerable populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278134">We published guidelines for long-term care facilities to prevent and control COVID-19 outbreaks. We are investing billions of dollars in the procurement of PPE for health care workers, including the staff of long-term care facilities. We have provided $3 billion to the provinces and territories to increase the wages of low-income essential workers, such as staff at long-term care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278135">Members of the Canadian Armed Forces were deployed in more than 50 long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario, as my colleague mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278136">In the Speech from the Throne, our government presented ambitious plans to work with other levels of government to improve how our society cares for seniors in long-term care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278137">Our government is committed to working with the provinces and territories to establish new national standards for long-term care. Our government will include in the Criminal Code penalties for those who neglect seniors under their care, putting them in harm's way. Our government will also examine other measures specifically for personal support workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278138">Together with other measures, all this could help provide better protection for seniors and prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278139">In conclusion, seniors built our country and continue to make an important contribution to our economy, our families and our communities. Seniors need to know that they can always count on our government to be sensitive to their needs and work hard to meet them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6278140">Madam Speaker, families are incredibly worried that their loved ones in long-term care will not get the support they need. They do not want to see more jurisdictional wrangling or finger pointing; they need concrete action now. The long-term care crisis is a national problem and the federal government must play a leadership role to resolve it immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6278141"> When the Liberal government previously struck targeted funding agreements in budgets to improve home and community care as well as mental health and addiction services, all in provincial competency by the way, it did not use jurisdiction as an excuse not to act. Long-term care residents deserve equal protection from COVID-19 no matter where they live in Canada. Therefore, when can Canadian seniors expect concrete action to improve their care in these vulnerable facilities?</ParaText>
