And somebody skated up to me and said, 'Somebody wants to talk to you over there.' I'd never seen Foster Hewitt in my life. He was just on the radio. He said, 'How do you pronounce your name?

While it is vitally important that we have child care, particularly in the recovery, given that women have been disproportionately impacted, do not mind me if I do not hold my breath, given the fact that the Liberals have promised child care since the nineties. Since then, kids who needed child care have grown up and have kids who now need child care. We need a concrete action plan, at least $2 billion, to keep the existing child care spaces open and $10 billion a year to truly create a universal child care plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374176">Our government's highest priority continues to be the health and well-being of Canadians. That is why we are taking unprecedented action to combat the health emergency presented by COVID-19.

              <ParaText id="6374179">Canadians know how much of a threat climate change is to our health, our economic well-being and our planet. We are already experiencing the ravages of climate change, what with extreme weather events, catastrophic floods and devastating fires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374180">As with COVID-19, ignoring the risks of climate change is not an option. Such an approach will only increase costs and worsen the long-term consequences. To use a pandemic metaphor, if we want to flatten the climate curve and avoid its worst effects, the best available science tells us that the planet must reach net zero by 2050.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6374181">Reaching net zero by 2050 means that emissions produced 30 years from now would be fully absorbed through actions that scrub carbon from the atmosphere, whether through nature, such as planting trees or through technology, such as carbon capture and storage systems. This imperative comes at a time when the world is changing. We are seeing an acceleration of global momentum and healthy competition toward a net-zero carbon economy by 2050 as nations, investors and consumers recognize the ecological imperative and the economic opportunity of moving to a clean economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374182">Over 120 countries have made a commitment to be net zero by 2050, including many of our major economic competitors and trading partners. This will likely soon include our biggest trading partner south of the border. Low carbon and climate-resilient projects and technologies are not just good for the planet, they are good for business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374183">Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, recently said that the transition to net zero “...is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our age.” On the day before Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> was introduced in this House, Tiff Macklem, the current Governor of the Bank of Canada, said that “...we need to position Canada to seize the climate-smart opportunities that consumers, workers and investors are looking for.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374184">Major Canadian companies have already committed to net zero by 2050, including companies such as Cenovus, Teck Resources, MEG Energy, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Enbridge and the Canadian Steel Producers Association. Shell's global chief executive officer says that net zero is “the only way to go” for his company. Canadian companies such as Maple Leaf Foods and CAE are already carbon neutral. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374185">Leveraging climate action as we rebuild Canada's post-pandemic economy is simply the smart thing to do. It will ensure that we emerge stronger, better prepared and more competitive in a low-carbon world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374186">During the last election campaign, our government promised to come up with a plan that would allow Canada to exceed its pollution reduction targets and create a legally binding process for all future governments to set national climate targets that will achieve the science-based goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act, is the fulfillment of our commitment to Canadians to put these legally binding processes in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374187">This process is essential to our strategy for a sustainable post-pandemic economic recovery and long-term prosperity for all Canadians in a low-carbon world. It reflects our government's desire to stimulate our collective ambition for climate action and to do more than ever before in a considered and pragmatic way, guided by scientific data and evidence.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6374188">The proposed Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act is an important contribution to articulating a Canadian vision for a clean economy, and it sends a signal of the depth of our resolve to be a serious competitor in the clean global marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374189">To do that, we need to tool up for low-carbon advantage and demonstrate that Canada is meeting climate risk head-on. By doing so, we can provide the confidence and certainty required to attract investment and ensure that Canadians are delivering products and services that will be in high demand the world over now and well into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374190">The bill marks the first time a Canadian government has introduced emissions accountability legislation to address climate change and achieve net zero by 2050. One element of its importance is that accountability legislation has the muscle to depoliticize climate action by setting legal requirements on governments to achieve climate headway. It is intended to ensure that never again will Canada have a government like that of Stephen Harper, which established an emissions reduction target but never brought forward a credible plan to achieve it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374191">The Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act would be the first significant step in the second phase of our government's climate plan. In phase one, during our first term in government, we spearheaded the creation of a pan-Canadian framework to fight climate change that comprised over 50 separate initiatives, including a price on pollution, a plan to phase out coal by 2030 and historic investments in public transit, nature and renewables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374192">In the coming weeks, the government will be announcing an enhanced clean-growth plan and further investments that encourage, accelerate and support the work Canadian businesses are doing to move to a thriving carbon-neutral economy. The plan will also provide Canadians with visibility on how we will meet and exceed our 2030 Paris Agreement target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374193">Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> provides the legal framework to put the emissions reductions goal of that plan and future plans between now and the middle of the century into law. The act would provide a legally binding process for this government and for future governments to set national climate targets on a rolling basis every five years between 2030 and 2050 and to meet the goal of net zero by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374194">It would provide that this government and future governments must bring forward detailed plans as to how they would meet these targets. In the near term, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> would require the Government of Canada to establish the initial 2030 target within six months of the act's coming into force, along with an emissions reduction plan. Both would have to be tabled in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374195">A progress report would have to be tabled by 2027. If the government of the day is not on track to meet the 2030 milestone, it would have to detail how it will get back on track. In addition, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, supported by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada, would have to examine and report on the Government of Canada's implementation of the measures aimed at mitigating climate change within five years of the coming into force of this act and every five years thereafter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374196">For each subsequent milestone year, in 2035, 2040 and 2045, a target would have to be set and an emissions reduction plan established at least five years in advance of each subsequent milestone year. Both would have to be tabled in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374197">Finally, if a target is not met, the government would have to table a report in Parliament detailing the reasons why and identifying specific actions to correct course and catch-up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374200">The five-year targets and the plans for meeting them will be based on the best scientific information available.

              <ParaText id="6374201">The input and engagement from all parts of Canadian society are crucial. The Government of Canada simply cannot achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century on its own. That is why the act would establish the independent net-zero advisory body, a group of up to 15 experts with a diverse range of experience and expertise from across the country. It would include business, labour, indigenous, clean technology and environmental leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374202"> The advisory body's ongoing advice to government over the next 30 years would be informed by extensive consultation and engagement with Canadians. Its initial work would focus on identifying actions that support both net zero and economic recovery from the pandemic. The advisory body would provide its advice through an annual public report, and the government would be required to publicly respond to the advisory body's recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374203">All of the public reporting measures are designed to ensure accountability to Canadians and accountability built on transparency, both of which are vital to establishing credibility with Canadians. Moreover, transparency and accountability are key to fostering dialogue when friction arises on the ways and means of moving forward on climate change. Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> lays out a framework of accountability and transparency to ensure we reach net zero by 2050 in a way that gives Canadians confidence that as a nation we will succeed in this endeavour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374204">Should the bill pass, it will be extremely difficult for any future government to shirk its responsibility to take action on climate change. I believe the reaction in Parliament and among Canadians generally would provide severe sanction to a government that did not honour its legal obligations under the act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374211">I am confident that together, in the spirit of co-operation, we can achieve an outcome that allows us to continue to move another step forward to address the threat of climate change. I have engaged in constructive conversations with many of my parliamentary colleagues on moving forward with action to address climate change, and it is my hope that we can work together to pass the bill in this minority Parliament so that we can quickly move forward on its implementation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374212">At the end of the day, climate change is a science issue, not an issue of ideology. It should not be a partisan issue. It is my hope that MPs from all parties in the House will work together and collectively support this vital legislation.</ParaText>

From copper to nickel to energy, Canada has the resources needed to develop, produce and deploy clean technologies and proven expertise. We have a productive and resilient manufacturing sector. We also have the innovative spirit, talent and experience to be among the world's cleanest suppliers of natural resources, and we have the drive, born of a chance, to create a future we can pass along to our children and grandchildren with confidence and with pride.</ParaText>

Last week as parliamentarians we received a 13-minute briefing on the bill with zero opportunity to ask questions and to have those questions answered. We have to ask, why was that? Why was there no opportunity to ask questions? This is a bill that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> describes as an accountability framework, and on the very first day we are being denied the simple most important part of being accountable: the right to ask questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374250">I have read the bill and much of the media coverage, and on that note I have to give the Liberal government full credit for its media rollout on the bill. Many headlines read “A road map to net-zero emissions,” which is rather fascinating because while the bill is clear on where it would like to go, it is completely void of any actual detail on how to get there. In fact, if it were a map, it would simply show where we wanted to be but no map or trails on how to get there. That is kind of the point, is it not?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374251">In typical Liberal fashion, this bill will not hold the current government accountable for climate failures, only future governments. The easiest promises to make are those that do not require the maker to be held accountable, and that is exactly what the Liberals are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374252">The Liberals continue to promise both too much and too little when it comes to climate change. Their approach is obviously not working. The Liberal government's projections show that the government is not even close to keeping its current commitments, and yet it plans to set new, even higher targets to be met down the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374253">Let us take a look back in history. If we go back about 27 years, in 1993, former Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% relative to 1988 levels by 2005. What happened to those promises? They were broken. There are others.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374254">Let us go to 1997 when Prime Minister Chrétien signed the Kyoto accord. This promise was to reduce our emission levels by a smaller amount of 6% below 1990 levels. That would be achieved by 2012. What happened to that promise? In 2006, when the Liberals were voted out of office, Canada was 30% over that commitment. As a result, we know that former prime minister Stephen Harper eventually had to withdraw Canada from the Kyoto agreement because we could not reach that target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374255">Let us not forget that in 2009, at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, Prime Minister Harper matched the U.S. target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 30% by 2030 in what was a non-binding agreement. In 2015, shortly after the election of the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, he sent the largest Canadian delegation in history to attend the Paris UN Climate Change Conference and at excess cost, I would say, of $1 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374256">We all know that in Paris, despite often criticizing the former Harper government, ultimately the Liberal government adopted the same targets.

It has missed its 2020 target by 123 million tonnes. Once again, we are not meeting our greenhouse gas reduction targets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374258">Obviously, the government is following a pattern: It promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a certain amount by a certain date and then it breaks that promise. It makes another promise and then it breaks that one too.</ParaText>

I just firmly believe that when we debate the bill, we must be very candid about what is really up for debate, as it is certainly not a road map as some have described it. I will actually give the Liberal government some credit for that, because it did not follow the usual approach of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, which is to promise things he has no intention of delivering on. We know the Prime Minister is an expert at making promises he will never have to be responsible for. Setting targets 30 years down the line means that future governments have 30 years to figure it out. More importantly, industry has the time to come up with much-needed solutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374264">Indeed, the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> has spoken of improving energy efficiency in homes and businesses. He has talked about hydrogen fuel cells, as well as the potential for small modular nuclear reactors, although I will note on the last point that once again the Liberal government has delayed promised plans and details on that. The point is that what the bill would do, by making commitments so far in the future, is leave the door open for future innovation. We know that we will see more electric vehicles in our future, some built right here in Canada, a made in Canada solution.</ParaText>

I am pleased that our<Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> has recognized some of them. Personally, as environment critic, I love it when we can all agree on areas where we can use innovation rather than fiscal measures to reduce our emissions. We will not prosper as a nation by taxing ordinary Canadians and making industry foot the bill for costly regulations. That may be the Liberal way, but it is not the right way.</ParaText>

He pledged to recognize the importance of ensuring that Canada meets its greenhouse gas emission commitments. If we want to do that, we all have to work together on areas where we can come to an agreement. I believe that much of our time in the previous Parliament was spent talking about issues on which we disagree. When we do that, we are not serving the interests of future Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374268">The reality is, from my perspective, there is really nothing to oppose in this bill. In many respects, it is a <I>Seinfeld</I> bill. It is largely devoid of details or costs. In fact, I suspect that those who will be opposing this bill will do so for that very reason. Canadians agree on the importance of protecting our environment and natural spaces. It is an issue that our party and leader are passionate about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374269">In my speech thus far, I have not mentioned the Canadian oil and gas industry, much as this bill is also largely silent on this essential Canadian industry. We know this industry has publicly stated it is committed to the highest environmental standards in the world, and many of its members have committed to net zero by 2050. We need to ensure that these critically important Canadian industries will be part of the solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374270">We will be proposing amendments to this bill in committee that clearly state that Canadian oil and gas has the highest environmental standards in the world, and that any action plan must draw on that expertise and ensure that oil and gas play a necessary role in providing the world with energy. This legislation must also recognize that Canadian energy is not the enemy, as many Liberals believe, but part of the solution. As I mentioned previously, we need to find ways that we can work together if we are to succeed.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6374271">We also need a mechanism that can, over time, figure out how much it will cost Canadians to remain on that path to net-zero emissions by 2050. The Parliamentary Budget Officer indicated that, in order to meet our current commitments by 2030, the carbon tax might have to increase to over $200 a tonne, but the Liberals still refuse to be honest with Canadians about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374272">I know some people will say that it will cost a lot more to do nothing. However, consider for example someone on a fixed annual income who lives in a 70-year-old house when winter temperatures fall below -20°C. Their monthly heating bill could force them to choose between heat and groceries for the month. We cannot ignore this. We cannot ignore the fact that many rural communities do not have public transit. In many cases, they have lost Greyhound as a private carrier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374273">Millions of Canadians depend on imported fuel oil to heat their homes because no other options are available. We cannot forget about those Canadians, and they should not be forced to carry a disproportionate share of the cost burden.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6374274">I mention this because when it comes to putting a price on pollution, as the current Liberal government likes to say, we know that all too often some of the biggest industrial polluters typically get exemptions from the price they pay on their pollution because of carbon leakage, which is a big concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374275">What is carbon leakage, for those unfamiliar with the term? When an industry in one jurisdiction is paying carbon taxes and cannot compete with that same industry in another jurisdiction that is not paying carbon taxes, the situation is called carbon leakage. We know that if an industry loses market share to heavier-polluting competitors, it affects our economy and does not reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374276"> Carbon leakage is not the only example of where big polluters get a break from paying a price on pollution. In British Columbia, although the B.C. NDP government signed on to the Liberals' carbon tax framework, the new B.C. LNG investment will be exempt from the carbon tax increases called for in that agreement. This is not an isolated incident where a polluting industry in B.C. has secured some form of carbon tax relief.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374277">Why am I raising these points? Because we cannot ignore the fact that more and more major polluters in Canada are being exempted from paying the price for their pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374278">These carbon tax exemptions rarely make the headlines for various reasons, but they do happen. However, the average citizen or the small business owner has to pay for their pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374279">This brings me to the last, but not least, part of my speech on this bill. Since it will take 30 years to meet the targets, we have an opportunity to try to work with our biggest trading partner, the United States. Hopefully, we will have a clearer idea of the policies and regulations required to help us collectively reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374280">These emissions are a global problem. Climate change has had devastating effects on many sectors in my riding over the past year. Forest fires and floods have caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage. Local farmers have been hard hit by changing weather patterns. I am sure that other members in the House have had similar experiences.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374282">It may raise some eyebrows that my party will be supporting this bill at second reading, but if we are going to have any success, we need to find those things that we can agree upon and take action. There are things we can and must agree on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374283">In summary, I see very little in this bill to oppose. It is not a road map. It is essentially a piece of paper with a destination on it. Fighting climate change at home and around the world is an important goal that requires work. It will be current and future governments that will start to fill in the map and show how they intend to reach that destination, but we must agree on a starting point. I would submit that is precisely what Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> is: a starting point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374284"> I, for one, will be supporting this bill for what it is, and what it can and must become. What I do not support is the Liberals' failed record on climate change. They are on track to miss their 2030 climate commitments, and they have failed to plant a single tree. My wife has planted more trees than the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374285">The Liberals continue to over-promise and under-deliver when it comes to climate change, and their approach is clearly not working. Conservatives will build a climate policy that respects the jurisdiction of the provinces, focuses on making industry pay rather than taxing ordinary Canadians, and is founded on proven market-based principles for incentivizing positive economic change. Conservatives understand that reaching net-zero is a goal that Canadians care about and want to see action on. We must preserve our shared environment for future generations without sacrificing the jobs Canadians need today or damaging the economic engine that helps fund our vital social programs. Canadian workers are counting on it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374323">Let us talk about Bill C-12. There are several interesting terms in it, like “transparency”, “accountability” and “net-zero emissions”. I have to admit, it is certainly a good first step. The government is taking this further than probably any other government before it. However, the reality is that, when you read the bill, you soon realize that it is nowhere near sufficient to address the climate emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374324">I will say it right out of the gate: Bill C-12 is dishearteningly tame. It needs to be more binding. If the Liberals are serious in their desire to protect the environment, ensure a green future for the next generation, implement a fair, green economic recovery plan, put an end to the cycle of broken promises and missed targets on greenhouse gas reductions and respect their commitment made around the Paris Agreement, they will surely be open to amending and enhancing the bill to make it more binding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374325">The emergency is real, and the health and financial crisis we are experiencing should not be an excuse for setting aside the climate crisis and the measures required to address it. Canada’s performance in reducing greenhouse gases leaves much to be desired. I would even say that it is embarrassing. Canada has never met its targets. It had to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol and will likely not meet the Paris Agreement targets. If it could, the government would have put that in the bill and shown more boldness and ambition. It would perhaps have been a little less concerned about 2050 and a little more about 2030. It would certainly be more concerned about the importance of meeting our international commitments than honouring its own election promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374326">Climate change should not be a partisan issue. Unfortunately, that is what we are seeing with this bill. During the 2019 election campaign, the Liberals promised to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and they are repeating that promise with this bill, without telling us how they are going to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374327">I want to act in good faith, but Bill C-12 is so easy to criticize, even for the government. According to Environment Canada’s most optimistic projections, we will miss the 2030 target. We must stop burying our heads in the sand; Canada will not achieve its emission reduction target of 30% by 2030. We are a whopping 77 megatonnes short, even if we take into account the impact of the reduction measures that have been announced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374328">When you are about to miss a target, your logical priority should be to do everything in your power to quickly rectify the situation, reverse course and preach by example. The Bloc Québécois is not the only one to say this; environmental groups are saying the same thing. The Association québécoise de lutte contre la pollution atmosphérique says that the bill is extremely vague and not particularly binding, and that it shows that the Government of Canada has not done the work since 2015. Like us, they are still waiting for a serious and responsible commitment on the part of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374329">We are hearing the same thing from the Climate Action Network, Ecojustice, Environmental Defence Canada, the West Coast Environmental Law Association and Équiterre, although I am not naming any names.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374330">I will say it again: Canada failed to meet any of its international climate targets. In its current form, Bill C-12 provides very little guarantee that this trend will change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374331">We know that we want to move toward a net-zero economy and way of life, but we still do not know how to get there. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that it will take more than one or two somewhat stringent measures to get there. For now, we have no idea whether the most polluting industries will have targets to meet, which is regrettable, whether we are moving toward the electrification of transportation or whether we will support some form of circular economy. We do not know any of this because there is no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374332">With Bill C-12, the Liberals are asking us to vote on a plan we have not seen yet. For now, what we know is that we will probably achieve net-zero emissions in 2050, even if we do not really know what that looks like.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374333">Now is the time for concrete measures that will actually help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374334">The bill must ensure real accountability, not only for meeting the targets that are already on the table, but for aligning Canada with the Paris Agreement and its ultimate goal of limiting average global warming to 1.5°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374335">It is crucial that Canada have a five-year accountability cycle, that it start in 2025, not 2030 or 2050, and that it align with the Paris Agreement’s five-year inventory cycle and its goal of raising the stakes. That is the demand of every environmental group worth its salt and every individual who believes in the need for energy transition to ensure our survival on this planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374336">I have trouble understanding the government’s lack of ambition and initiative with respect to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>. We should be past the point where we need to plan for an energy transition. In fact, we should be making the transition now, because 2050 is in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374337">We have to be realistic; the solution to the economic, health and climate emergencies does not lie in the perpetuation of an oil-based economy. We need to invest in natural resource processing, research and innovation in our institutions and the production of our own clean, renewable energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374338">We must admit that Quebec has a lot to offer in this area. That is where our wealth lies; Canada’s wealth lies elsewhere. That is why, we in the Bloc Québécois think that the government should provide substantial assistance for the energy and economic transition of certain provinces toward a sustainable wealth creation model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374339">Economic development based on green technologies, such as biomass, wind and solar energy, hydroelectricity and geothermal energy can sustainably fuel progress and it can certainly be used as a model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374340">The Bloc Québécois can propose a number of concrete measures. In this bill, we would have liked to see a plan outlining concrete measures for achieving our goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374341">I want to get back to the Climate Action Network. I could not agree more with their desire to decarbonize the economy. It is an interesting concept that is now more relevant than ever. People often say that the environment should go hand in hand with the economy; you cannot have one without the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374342">I had an interesting conversation recently with Paul Fauteux, an environmental lawyer who was the director general of Environment Canada’s Climate Change Bureau and co-head of the Canadian delegation to the international negotiations on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. He is an optimist, but he is disappointed with the government’s inaction. We were discussing the fact that we should not be afraid of the energy transition and that we should not see it as bad for the economy or as a destroyer of high-paying jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374343">The opposite is true. Moving away from fossil fuels will result in net gains in employment. Whether for installing solar panels or renovating homes to adapt them to climate change and make them more energy efficient, the potential is huge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374344">However, decarbonizing the economy does not only mean that we are trading oil industry jobs for jobs in the solar and wind energy industry. We can build a low-carbon caring economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374345">Some members may be wondering what a caring economy is. It is an economy where we care for the planet as much as we care for each other. The lowest-carbon jobs are the ones that do not extract anything from the land, that do not create any new waste and that have a limited impact on the environment. These jobs, often performed by women, need to be more highly valued. This work of caring for the most vulnerable members of our communities must be better understood. As part of our economic transition, care work needs to be become a good job, with union benefits, fair pay and safety protections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374346">Last Sunday, Laure Waridel, an associate professor with the Institute of Environmental Sciences at the Université du Québec à Montréal, said that it will take profound change, binding measures, systematic measures, because we are at the point where we have to completely transform the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374347">We are driven by development. This development brings in money, of course, but it is costly in terms of greenhouse gases. There is a cost, not just an environmental one, but also a social one, and that is fundamental.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374348">The problem is that we are individualistic and think only of ourselves. The government is certainly not setting a good example. We need to stop working in isolation. We need to join forces. That is how we will build a society that is a bit greener and a bit fairer. In fact, I hope it will be a lot greener and fairer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374349">For that to happen, we need a government that can put partisanship aside and stop with the hypocrisy. It needs to walk the talk, as we say. A government cannot claim it wants to achieve net-zero emissions and in the same breath say that it will make the Keystone XL pipeline a priority in its relations with the United States. That makes no sense. It is literally an example of saying one thing but doing another. The government needs to choose between investing in the future and driving straight into a wall. I am sure members would agree that the right choice is to invest in the future. However, this cannot happen without real measures to reduce our carbon footprint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374350">Even the Canada Energy Regulator has projected that if Canada strengthens its climate policies to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, neither the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion nor the new Keystone XL pipeline will be necessary. That is interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374351">Why does the government stubbornly support projects that are harmful to the environment? These projects are not even embraced by the new U.S. administration. These projects are not sustainable in the long term, as current events constantly remind us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374352"> A group of over 100 economists and natural resources experts from all across Canada recently urged the government to abandon Trans Mountain before sinking any more of taxpayers' money into it. As I was saying earlier, this money should instead be used to accelerate the transition to a greener economy, particularly in Alberta, Canada's leading oil producer. We need to be far more aggressive in immediately transitioning away from oil and gas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374353">The International Energy Agency recently calculated that the demand for oil should drop by 30% over the next two decades if the countries that signed the Paris Agreement on climate change respect their commitments. The oil-based economy is no longer viable in the long term, and experts are doing all they can to remind us of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374354">On Monday, the World Meteorological Organization published a report showing that, despite the brief decline in greenhouse gas emissions because of the COVID-19 crisis, concentrations of these same gases have reached record highs. Once again, these data show that urgent action must be taken because, as greenhouse gases continue to rise, the social and economic costs of inaction rise with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374355">This could not be any clearer. We have to rework Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> to give it more teeth because the way this bill is currently worded, it does not measure up. The government has to work with the opposition to improve its bill by adding a target for 2025, a more ambitious goal for 2030, and a requirement to meet the targets instead of simply preparing to present reports that will outline yet another failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374356">Again, the mandatory target for 2030, in other words Canada's commitment under the Paris Agreement, should be enshrined in law, and unfortunately, that is not currently the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374357">I will come back to the particularly important words that the bill puts forward: “transparency”, “accountability”. The one that seems to be missing is responsibility. Instead of making the government responsible to Parliament, this bill wants to make the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> the one who sets the interim targets. Clause 11 even gives him the right to amend the targets and emissions reduction plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374358">If the minister and the government think that they will not be able to meet their greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, all they have to do is amend the targets and once again become fake climate champions. The government could change its targets to suit lobby and industry groups. That is not a serious approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374359">The only limits that Bill C-12 imposes on the government, if it decides to amend the established targets somewhere along the way, is that it must consult its own federal ministers and provide an opportunity for comment to the public, the provinces and territories, indigenous groups, and advisory bodies created by the government itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374360">Consulting an advisory body is good, but it is not the same thing as evaluating the measures and the progress towards the goal. Can these really be called limits? No. In addition, the minister reserves the right to choose which comments to share with civil society. The advisory bodies are window dressing, just like the role of the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development in the bill. The bill does not even have the commissioner assess the minister's action plan based on progress towards the Paris targets. Once again, with no independent authority to assess the targets, tools and progress, this is not a serious approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374361">We need a climate bill in which achievement of targets no longer depends solely on the will of the government of the day. The government must be accountable for its climate action. It must answer to the thousands of people who are counting on it simply to ensure healthy living conditions on Earth in a future that is nearer than we think.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374362">I will give another example of the government's lack of seriousness when it comes to accountability. According to clause 16, the minister himself will state, in his own report, the reasons for failing to meet the target and the actions taken to address the failure. That means that the minister will be assessing his own performance. Self-assessment: is that what the Liberals' commitment to transparency comes to?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374363">According to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the reports on the targets, whether or not they are achieved, must be submitted to Parliament and made public. That is fine. However, once again, there is a big loophole, because nothing in this bill requires that the content of the reports be assessed by an independent authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374364">We have a lot of work to do, and I sincerely hope that every party in the House will collaborate to improve this bill and make it a truly binding text that will make all of our constituents proud. I am thinking of the mothers who are fighting on the front lines for their children's future, and the young people who are taking to the streets and to our courtrooms to demand that we fulfill our commitments. They are the people to whom the government should be accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374365">That is why I introduced my bill, Bill <Document DbId="10866095" Type="4">C-215</Document>. We need a transparent, accountable government. We need to measure progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions based on targets. Let's talk about my bill, because I hope that the government and the other parties will be inspired to set stronger limits on the governments that take office between now and 2050, no matter their political stripe. I believe that is the approach we must take. Once and for all, we must pass climate legislation that does not change with the political party in power. The climate emergency demands it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374366">With Bill C-215, we are proposing to require that the government announce the suite of measures that it plans to take to reach its targets. The government would thus be accountable as soon as the bill is passed, and it would have to respond publicly if it failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374367">With Bill <Document DbId="10866095" Type="4">C-215</Document>, we would entrench in Canadian law our international commitments under the Paris Agreement and make them mandatory in Canada. It is essential that we do so. Bill C-215 also requires the government to establish additional measures to ensure that its action plan meets the requirements of this act. If not, the government must inform and explain to the House why it failed to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374368">Under Bill C-215, the minister's action plan must include interim targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to be achieved by 2025, 2030, 2035 and 2040, measures to be taken to achieve these targets, the method for calculating Canadian greenhouse gas emissions, tools or instruments for measuring the progress made and tools for assessing the impact of emission reductions. Those are what I call real constraints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374369">Of course my Bloc Québécois colleagues and I support climate legislation, but we think it must have truly binding measures so that future governments have the legislative tools they need to stay on course for a healthy and hopefully carbon-neutral future, a future in which, most importantly, greenhouse gas emissions will be significantly lower, not just compensated for by bogus measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374370">Regardless of whether we are in government or in opposition, as parliamentarians, we must do better. As I said, the climate crisis must not be a partisan issue. That said, I am very much looking forward to studying this bill in committee. I do have reservations, but climate legislation is crucial. I am impressed with the minister's involvement on this file. I know he wants to ensure a healthy future for the next generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374371">The legislative process presents a perfect opportunity to establish the robust accountability framework we need to ensure that Canada meets its international commitments and to support the aggressive action needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Let's work together towards that goal.</ParaText>

I am talking about accountability here as well. The government must be accountable to the public. People want to know where we stand with our reduction targets. They want to know if these targets have been met and what needs to be done.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6374411">Madam Speaker, climate accountability legislation is so important. Why is it important? I had a question asked of me a few times this week by journalists. They asked why people should care about this. When I say we have missed every international climate target we have set, every single one, it does not really get to the heart of what is happening. We are so used to broken promises. We are so used to a government telling us we are on track, that it is taking action and that it understands the urgency, when its actions and urgency in no way match the scale of the crisis we are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374412">Why does this matter? For one thing, it is because we are stealing the future from our children. The young people know it, and they should not have to feel that fear. They should not have to march in the streets because politicians are not protecting their futures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374413">Before I ran for office, I taught a course at the University of Victoria that covered climate change and social movements. I remember that during one of the breaks, a young woman in my class came up with to me tears in her eyes. She asked me how she should study and work on the things we were talking about when scientists are telling us that we have a decade to turn this around. She said that if we fail, it means the collapse of ecosystems, mass extinctions and millions of people dying, along with our food systems and our future. We talked about how we maintain hope, how we make space to grieve and how to tap into fear and pain while continuing to fight for a livable planet. She went on to help organize climate strikes in Victoria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374414">Her wisdom and leadership, and the wisdom and leadership of kids across Canada and around the world, often bring me to tears. They motivate me to action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374415">What this young woman was doing was listening to the science and looking at the challenges we face, straight on. She was seeing and feeling the urgency. When people do that, when they choose not to look away and let themselves feel the real threat of what we are facing, what our children are facing and what it means for their futures, it is devastating, heartbreaking and terrifying. If people are willing to stay with that feeling, then they have no choice but to act and no choice but to act with the urgency that matches the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374416">When Greta Thunberg said to world leaders, “How dare you...look away”, this is what she was talking about, and given that the government has put forward a bill that puts off climate accountability for the next 10 years, I can only assume that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> and every Liberal MP are choosing to look away. Maybe they do so because it is politically inconvenient to feel. Maybe they do so because it is unparliamentary to show emotions while debating legislation. Maybe they do so because it is scary to stand up, speak out, act with courage and face the consequences. However, whatever the reason, I say, “How dare you look away.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374417">However, it is not too late. We could still turn this small step in the right direction into something meaningful and real, and something that would give those young people some hope that the politicians who have so often betrayed them feel the urgency and are going to do something to turn this around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374418">We could still amend the bill to put in a milestone target of 2025. We could strengthen the accountability measures in the bill. We could ensure that the targets we set are in line with the best available science, our international obligations and equity principles.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374419">I encourage every member, especially those on the government side of the House, not to look away and to take a moment to feel the scale of the crisis we are facing, the urgency. I hope they will work with us to make the bill something our children can be proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374420">In that spirit, I want to go through the parts of the bill I was really glad to see and then the parts that are missing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374421">I will mention the top three pieces that I appreciate about the bill. First, putting a commitment to net zero by 2050 into law is essential. The bill would not only ensure that the net-zero target is put into law, but also ensure we legislate our other long-term targets. Second, it was good to see the bill explicitly name the government’s commitment to upholding section 35 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Third, I am glad there would be progress reporting two years before each milestone target, with an opportunity to adjust and take additional actions if we are off track.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374422">When it comes to the things that are missing, of course the most egregious omission is the lack of any real accountability for the next 10 years and the glaring omission of a 2025 milestone target. Scientists have been clear that this decade is the most important. The next 10 years are the ones the IPCC says are crucial if we want to have any hope of avoiding catastrophic climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374423">It is hard to wrap my head around how the government can put forward a climate accountability bill that would put off and avoid accountability for the most important 10 years. It is hard for me to understand how Liberal members of Parliament, especially those with children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, can stand behind the bill, how they can look young people in the eyes and tell them they have to wait another decade. It is an easy fix: Put in a 2025 milestone target. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374424">The second big gap is in the need for stronger accountability mechanisms, both with the arm’s-length advisory body, which only gives advice right now but does not have a defined role in assessments or reviewing progress, and with the environment commissioner, who, in the bill, would only have to do one report every five years. Neither of these bodies have the capacity or mandate in the bill to properly hold the government to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374425">As it stands, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is mainly accountable to himself. The government determines what targets should be set, opening up the opportunity to set weak targets, and whether the government is on track to meeting those targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374426">To fix these issues we need to strengthen and clearly define the advisory body's role in establishing targets, reviewing climate plans and evaluating progress reports and assessment reports. We also must guarantee that this body is composed of independent experts from all regions of Canada, and that it includes indigenous and worker representatives and does not include fossil fuel executives or industry representatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374427">These fixes would strengthen the advisory body, but we also need to ensure the environment commissioner is reporting on whether our targets are in line with the best available science, whether our climate plan will actually get us to our target, whether our progress report and the assessment report are accurate and whether our proposed corrective actions are adequate for addressing the times when we are not on track. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374428">The environment commissioner could play an important role in this legislation, but we learned last week that the environment commissioner currently does not have the resources to do its regular environmental work, and that its staff and environmental experts can be reallocated to other projects by the Auditor General. We need to make the environment commissioner an independent officer of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374429">The third gap is the fact the government has given itself up to nine months, after the bill gets royal assent, to set a target for 2030 and therefore create a plan to meet that target. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374430">This means it could be up to a year from now until we see a plan to reach our 2030 target, yet in the Liberal government's most recent throne speech, the Liberals said they would immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada's 2030 climate goal. They said “immediately”. I do not know who defines “a year later” as “immediately”. I feel like we need to remind the government, again, that a plan to create a plan is not a plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374431">We know that climate accountability means nothing without climate action, so where is the government's climate action plan? When will we see the new target that exceeds our 2030 climate goals, and when will we see the plan to get us there? We need to see investments in green infrastructure, in transportation, in building retrofits and in building green affordable housing. We need a just and sustainable recovery, a green new deal that creates good family-sustaining jobs in the low-carbon economy. We need a just transition for workers, and all of this needs to be outlined in a climate plan that will get us to our targets, ones that are ambitious and that are based on keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374432"> There are a number of gaps that I will not cover in as much detail, but we should be talking about carbon budgets instead of milestone targets, about Canada's fair-share contribution to 1.5°C, and we should be requiring the minister to meet strong standards when setting targets, as well as strong standards when creating and adjusting plans. Currently, the bill would allow future governments to set weak targets and create plans without much detail. If we fail at strengthening the bill, we have to tell young people and tell Canadians that we were not courageous enough to put the measures in place to avoid catastrophic climate change, that we were not courageous enough to protect their future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374433">For most of this speech, I have been speaking about the future and the severe consequences of our present action and inaction. That future outlined in the IPCC report is scary, but this is not just about our future. The impacts of the climate crisis are already being felt in Canada. In my riding of Victoria and in B.C., it was not too long ago that we were choking on the smoke from the climate fires south of the border. We know that temperatures in Canada are increasing at twice the global rate. The impacts are felt particularly in the Arctic along the coasts, and are disproportionately felt by indigenous, rural, marginalized and racialized communities. Canadians want real action on the climate crisis, and they want a government that not only promises to fight climate change but will actually deliver on that promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374434">When I say, again and again, that our government has missed every single climate target and that the current Liberal government is not even on track to meet Stephen Harper's weak targets, I hope that the members in this chamber feel the seriousness of this failure, that they do not look away and that they feel the urgency. We need climate accountability now, not in 10 years. We need climate action now, not in nine months to a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374435">It was back in 2008 that the United Kingdom created its climate accountability framework, the Climate Change Act. This act was the first of its kind in the U.K., and it remains highly regarded and has served as a model for legislation in other jurisdictions, including Sweden, New Zealand, Denmark, France, Germany and Spain. The U.K. has set five-year carbon budgets covering immediately from 2008 onward, and regular reporting to Parliament has enhanced transparency and accountability. The U.K. also has an expert advisory committee, the Committee on Climate Change, that is much stronger than the advisory body proposed by the current government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374436">Two years before the U.K. implemented this bill, in 2006, Jack Layton, the leader of the NDP at the time, originally introduced the first climate accountability act in Canada. The bill passed at third reading by a vote of 148 to 116. The Harper Conservatives voted against it, but the bill died in the Senate. The NDP has introduced the climate change accountability act as a private member's bill in the 39th, 40th and 41st Parliament, by Jack but also by former MP Megan Leslie. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374437">Imagine where we would be if we had passed strong climate accountability legislation back then. Since implementing climate accountability, the U.K. has successfully reduced its emissions over the past decade, in stark contrast to Canada, whose emissions continue to increase despite the government's empty words and claims to climate leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374438">In this Parliament, my NDP colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252759" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>, have both put forward legislation in Parliament that calls for strong climate accountability. I want to thank my Bloc colleague for introducing Bill <Document DbId="10866095" Type="4">C-215</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374439">I want to highlight one important piece of the member for <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>'s bill, Bill <Document DbId="10866248" Type="4">C-232, an act respecting a climate emergency action framework</Document>. It provides for the development and implementation of a climate emergency action framework. It explicitly outlines how a climate emergency action framework and climate accountability legislation must be built on a foundation that recognizes the indigenous inherent right to self-government, that upholds the provisions in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and that takes into account scientific knowledge including indigenous science and knowledge as well as the responsibilities toward future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374440">While I was glad to see that the government included a commitment to upholding section 35 in UNDRIP in the preamble of the its bill, so far the Liberals have failed to enshrine UNDRIP into law. When will the government put action behind its words when it comes to reconciliation and put the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into law? We have a lot of work to do and we must come together if we want to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374441">As I wrap up, I want to note again that there can be no climate accountability without climate action. The government has missed every single climate target that it has set. Climate accountability is important, but the Liberals are not only putting it off for 10 years. They are also putting off a new target and a plan. They are putting off a climate action plan for up to another year. Where is the government's climate action plan? Part of that plan has to include an end to all fossil fuel subsidies. Stop giving away billions of dollars to profitable oil and gas companies. Stop throwing good money after bad at the Trans Mountain expansion. Please invest those billions of dollars in creating the good, sustainable jobs that people need right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374442">We need investments in green infrastructure, in transportation and in building retrofits. We need a just and sustainable recovery, a green new deal, one that creates good jobs in a low-carbon economy. We need a plan that is based on science and in line with keeping global temperatures below 1.5°C. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374443">We must move forward with climate action and climate accountability legislation immediately. We needed it in 2006 when Jack Layton first put it forward and Jack would not want us to wait another 10 years for climate accountability. We needed it in each iteration of the IPCC report. We needed it when we read about the catastrophic impacts of global warming. We needed it last year when young people were marching in the streets, begging politicians, begging decision-makers to listen to the science, to not look away, and we need it now. </ParaText>

It would seem that it would simply be unfair to exclude their voice from the consideration of things that should be done.

              <ParaText id="6374477">Private members' bills give us the opportunity to set aside our political allegiances, to rise as parliamentarians and to champion the causes of issues whose time has come. In that spirit, I reached out to all the MPs in this House from other parties, to speak about this legislation back before the first reading. I want to specifically thank Guy Caron, who spearheaded this legislation in the last Parliament. Now it is up to us to pick up where he left off and pass it into law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374478">The essence of this bill is pretty straightforward. Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> would allow small businesses, farm families and family fishing corporations the same tax rate when selling their operations to a family member as they would if they sold it to a third party. Currently, when a person sells their small business to a family member, the difference between the sale price and the original purchase price is considered to be a dividend. However, if the business is sold to a non-family member, the sale is considered a capital gain. A capital gain is taxed at a much lower rate and allows the seller to use the lifetime capital gains exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374479">It is completely unacceptable that it is more financially advantageous for a parent to sell their farm or small business to an absolute stranger than it is to their own children. I want to give two specific examples this afternoon on how this legislation will help families transfer their operations when they decide to make that transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374480">Imagine a bakery that a couple have owned for about 30 years. The couple running the bakery are now ready to retire and another bakery has reached out to indicate that they would like to purchase it from them. However, their daughter has worked with the couple throughout the years in that bakery as she has grown up and has indicated that she wants to take over the family business. Like a lot of small business owners and farmers, they could not afford to put large sums of money away into RRSPs and other saving vehicles, as any extra money that they had went into their own small business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374481"> This couple would rely on the sale of the bakery to basically fund their retirement plans, so they call upon an accountant to start a conversation about different planning scenarios. Their accountant comes back to them, saying if they sold the bakery to the other company, rather than their daughter, they would have an effective tax rate of 10% after using their lifetime capital gains exemption. Their accountant also told them that if they sold the bakery to their daughter, she would be obligated to repay their loan with personal tax dollars, which is a significant penalty. Compared to selling their bakery to the other company, it would render the effective tax rate to be significantly higher. With that information in hand, they have a family huddle and discuss the options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374482">The couple is now seriously considering selling the business outside of the family as they do to want to put the burden of their tax obligation on their daughter. It would inhibit her ability to make a living and grow the business. On the sale of shares to the bakery, this couple should be indifferent to selling shares to their daughter or the other company. Their daughter should not be penalized for purchasing shares from her parents and should be able to fund the purchase with corporate funds, as she would if she were to purchase the business from an unrelated party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374483">Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> would allow the next generation to become business owners and to keep businesses locally owned. With this bill, Bill C-208, we can fix this injustice once and for all. Right now many small businesses are struggling. This pandemic has been one of the most disruptive times in our lifetime. Across our country, no community is immune from its impact. To those entrepreneurs who are listening to this speech tonight, I have their back. Anyone who has ever run their own business understands the massive responsibility and stress that comes with being one's own boss. They are risk takers and job creators.

That is over 34% more in tax. I think we can all agree that it is completely unfair for the tax rate to be significantly higher when the farmer sells his operation to his son rather than to a third party who, in many cases, is a complete stranger.</ParaText>

The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252933" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> designed that package with Prime Minister Harper. The big problem, which I just found out yesterday, is there has been no compensation to those supply-managed chicken producers in Canada in the last few years at all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374517">I am pleased to take part in the debate today on private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>, which aims to facilitate the transfer of family businesses between family members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374518">Ensuring the sustainability of small businesses, family farms and fishing corporations is essential to our economy and to the communities that they serve. This has been underscored by the critical need to support families and communities as we continue to fight COVID-19. Our government understands this. From the outset of the pandemic, Canada's economic response to COVID-19 has introduced a range of support measures for small businesses to help bridge them to the other side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374519"> Simply put, we have their backs. That extends to helping family businesses thrive for generations to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374520">Encouraging the sale of family businesses to family members often means those businesses will remain in, and continue to benefit, their communities as well as the families that fought hard, sacrificed and succeeded through pure determination and entrepreneurial spirit. It is with this spirit in mind that Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> bears careful consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374521">Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> seeks to amend two of the Income Tax Act's most important and complex anti-avoidance rules. These rules deal with inter-corporate dividends, share sales and circumstances under which the lifetime capital gains exemption is charged. Any relieving changes to these sections of the act must be done cautiously, following rigorous study and debate, to avoid unintentionally creating loopholes that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy instead of protecting the middle class and those working hard to join it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374522">Section 84.1 of the act, in particular, is in place to apply an anti-avoidance rule where, when appropriate, an individual sells shares of one corporation to another corporation that is linked to an individual, such as a family member. When an individual sells shares of a Canadian corporation to a linked corporation, section 84.1 of the act deems, in certain circumstances, that the individual has received a taxable dividend from the linked corporation rather than a capital gain. This prevents the individual from realizing the proceeds of the sale on a tax-free basis using the lifetime capital gains exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374523">This rule is meant to ensure that taxpayers cannot use linked corporations to, in effect, remove earnings from their corporations, using a sale as a basis to do so. Without this rule, such sales between related parties could be used to convert what should be dividends to an individual shareholder into capital gains that are tax free under the lifetime capital gains exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374524">Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> proposes narrowing the scope of section 84.1 by removing the sale of shares of small businesses, family farms or fishing corporations from its application, when they are being sold by an individual to another corporation that is owned by their adult child or their grandchild. This change would allow the owner-operator of a family business to convert dividends to the corporation into a tax-free capital gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374525">It is important to note that there is currently nothing in the act stopping a parent from selling the shares of a family business directly to their child or grandchild on a tax-free basis using the lifetime capital gains exemption, which currently shelters up to $1 million in capital gains on qualified farm and fishing properties. The issues sought to be addressed by Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> arise only in multi-tier corporate structures, where one corporation owns a second corporation. Adopting the proposed changes to section 84.1 could open the door to new tax-avoidance opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374526">Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> also proposes amendments to section 55 of the act, which generally applies to corporations that seek to inappropriately reduce capital gains by paying excessive tax-free dividends between corporations, which the act considers to be a capital gain.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374527">Two exemptions to these anti-avoidance rules authorize businesses that are restructuring to allow company shareholders to split company shares between them while deferring taxes. The first exemption applies to the restructuring of related corporations and the second applies to all corporate restructuring. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374528">Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> would broaden the first exemption so that it applies to brothers and sisters, despite long-standing tax policy that considers brothers and sisters to have separate and independent economic interests for these purposes. Any change to this exemption would risk eroding our tax base. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374529">Spouses, as well as parents and their children, are already eligible for this exemption, because it is presumed that they have shared economic interests. Although brothers and sisters cannot restructure their participation in a corporation on a tax-deferred basis under the related corporations exemption, they can do it under the second exemption of section 55, which applies to all corporate restructurings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374530">This is called the butterfly exemption, and there are few tax avoidance opportunities under it. If the proposed amendments under section 55 included in Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> were passed, siblings could undertake business restructurings in which otherwise taxable capital gains realized between corporations would be converted into tax-free intercorporate dividends, which would create new opportunities for tax avoidance in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374531">I will conclude by saying that we know many businesses are continuing to face stress and uncertainty due to COVID-19. Our government has stepped up to the plate to make sure that they have the support during these unprecedented times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374532">We have made unprecedented support available to Canadian businesses, including the Canadian emergency business account, which has provided 758,000 business loans totalling $30 billion. The Canada emergency wage subsidy has supported the wages of more than 3.5 million employees totalling $36.7 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374533">Just this week applications were opened for the new Canada emergency rent subsidy, which will provide simple and easy-to-access commercial rent support and an additional lockdown support of 25% for businesses that have temporarily shut down due to mandatory public orders. Combined, this will mean the hard-hit businesses subject to lockdown will receive rent support up to 90%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374534">Our message to businesses remains the same. We have their back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374535">There are important considerations to take into account when we are reviewing the merits of Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. Our government remains committed to working with family businesses, including farming and fishing businesses, to make it efficient, or less difficult, to hand down their businesses to a next generation. However, we must exercise caution when making amendments to the Income Tax Act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374536">Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374537">Before I got into politics, I was the secretary to the Fédération de la relève agricole de l'Abitibi—Témiscamingue. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>, might be interested to know that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374538">The matter of transfers, particularly transfers to family members, is very important in Abitibi—Témiscamingue. I remember participating in a workshop about transfers hosted by the Réseau Agriconseils. A number of people attended because they were concerned about this issue, particularly since land value is different in Abitibi—Témiscamingue. Since our land is worth less than land in other parts of Quebec, it cannot be used as security as often. That is not the subject of this speech, but it is relevant when we are talking about the facility of transfer when a business is being transferred to a family member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374539">I had the opportunity to talk about this when I participated in the convention of the Fédération de la relève agricole du Québec, which took place in March in Rouyn-Noranda, located in my riding of Abitibi—Témiscamingue. As impossible as it may seem, still today, business owners are better off transferring their business to external shareholders than to a member of their own family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374540">I want to thank the member for Brandon—Souris for introducing his bill. I would have liked to introduce it myself, much like the member for <Affiliation DbId="253051" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>, as it is a fundamental issue. The Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. For several years now, my party has been calling for measures to encourage and facilitate the transfer of family businesses, especially in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. In fact, I would point out to my colleagues in the House that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252625" Type="2">Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères</Affiliation> introduced Bill <Document DbId="8283905" Type="4">C-275, an act to amend the Income Tax Act regarding business transfer</Document> in the previous Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374541">The Bloc Québécois has been calling for measures to encourage and facilitate the transfer of family businesses for more than 15 years. For Quebeckers, for the Bloc Québécois, and for me, business succession is important. The next generation is important for the future of our SMEs in general, but especially for the family farming businesses in the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374542"> Business succession is a major and promising phenomenon across Canada and especially in Quebec. Nearly one-third of Quebec's small and medium-sized businesses were buy-outs. In 2017, one-quarter of Canadian SMEs were takeovers. In Quebec, the majority of business buy-outs are in rural areas, where 44% of the SMEs belong to entrepreneurs who have taken over a business. In Canada, that figure is around 31%, according to UQTR professor Marc Duhamel, a regular researcher at the UQTR's small business research institute. Unfortunately, the government's unfavourable tax rules do little to encourage business succession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374543">The risk of sales to foreign buyers and businesses being lost is very real. In 2018, it was estimated that between 30,000 and 60,000 Quebec businesses would not find a buyer in the years to come and would die as a result. That represents around 150,000 jobs and $8 billion to $10 billion in revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374544">Right now, Quebec is losing one farm a day. That is alarming. The risk of sales to foreign buyers and businesses being lost is very real. In Quebec, the next generation of entrepreneurs is suffering badly. Unfortunately, this Parliament is not doing enough to support business succession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374545">Why does the Liberal Party not want to put a family member on equal ground with a foreign investor? Here are the facts. Under the existing legislation, the transfer of a business to a family member is treated as a dividend and not as a capital gain, unlike a sale to a third party. As a result, owners are not entitled to the lifetime capital gains exemption if they decide to sell the business to their children. The existing legislation is an affront to common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374546">Why does the Liberal Party of Canada refuse to amend the Income Tax Act? As we just heard, they appear to be worried about condoning tax evasion. That would explain why the Income Tax Act makes no mention of the notions of transferring, shuttering or selling a small business to a family member, for fear of potential abuse or tax fraud. If abuse and tax fraud are actual reasons, I am having trouble understanding why the Liberal Party continues to do nothing about tax havens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374547">As the member of Parliament for Abitibi—Témiscamingue, I have had the honour, along with members of my team, to speak with many farmers in my region week after week. I want to acknowledge the president of the Fédération de la relève agricole, Meghan Jarry. The federation and all business owners in Quebec see business succession as a key way to stop the outflow of businesses and Quebeckers to urban centres and to make it easier for young entrepreneurs to take over the family business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374548">Business succession is essential for Abitibi—Témiscamingue. It is essential for all of Quebec. The future of the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region is in the hands of the next generation of farmers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374549">I want to quote a farmer from the region, Simon Leblond, who is also a friend and a member of the Fédération de la relève agricole du Québec. He was the president of FRAQ when I was the secretary there. He said the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374550">

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I am certainly going to have challenges, starting with the financing and development of my company, of course. There are also other issues unique to my region, including maintaining a large enough pool of producers to maintain services for farms and, more generally, to ensure the vitality of the industry and make it known to those outside the world of agriculture. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374551">The next generation of farmers is essential because it ensures the vitality of agriculture, which in turn ensures the vitality of the towns in our regions. The vitality of our regions ensures the vitality of Quebec, the dynamic use of our land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374552">I think we need to talk about distress. In Abitibi-Témiscamingue and other parts of Quebec, farmers young and old are struggling. They have to deal with red tape, paperwork, long hours of work, their roles as mothers or fathers, bills, the stress of everyday life, the stress of being in debt, equipment that breaks down and has to be repaired or replaced, short production and crop seasons, poor weather conditions and all of the other pressures they are under.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374553">Farmers are in real distress. Encouraging and facilitating the transfer of family businesses could alleviate some of that distress. I think that is an important reason for members of the House to support Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374554"> Now I would like to talk about what things are really like for new farmers. We all know farmers are stubborn and tenacious people. They are probably the most resilient members of our society. Young farmers are constantly looking for ways to access assets and encourage the transfer and start-up of agricultural businesses in Quebec. They face major challenges, including land grabbing and land financialization, income security, vet services for farm animals, crop insurance and agricultural drainage. These are major challenges. Improving access to land and improving quality of life for Quebec's young farmers is one way to ensure a future in agriculture for Quebec's youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374555">It is the duty of this Parliament to create conditions conducive to establishing the next generation of farmers in order to attract that next generation and secure the future of small and medium family farms. That cannot happen without easier access to land. Transferring a farm is the best way to get a start in farming because starting a farm from scratch is very hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374556">On top of that, land prices, the cost of quotas and production standards are increasing every year. Farm values are increasing. It takes longer and longer and is increasingly difficult to transfer the farm to one's children. Paying back the loans needed to purchase a farm takes so long and the red tape is becoming increasingly cumbersome, making it increasingly difficult for farmers to access land and operate their businesses. Farmers want the process for purchasing a farm to be simplified. Some are calling for a single-desk model to avoid having to speak to too many stakeholders in a transfer process. Everything I have mentioned from the beginning of my speech reflects opinions expressed by the Fédération de la relève agricole du Québec, which works to improve the lives of young farmers in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374557">Just today, actually, I spoke with Julie Bissonnette, the president of the FRAC, and its executive director, Philippe Pagé. Regarding the transfer of a family farm, the Fédération de la relève agricole du Québec is unanimous: It is just wrong that it is more advantageous to sell the family farm to a stranger than to a family member. Julie Bissonnette told me today that she is always asked about this issue no matter where she goes. Young farmers in Quebec and the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region have been calling for legislative changes for several years now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374558">She also told me that it was a problem on both sides. The transferors also want this to change. The oldest farmers in Abitibi-Témiscamingue want to transfer their farms to family members. This means that local farming will be put on hold. Dozens, if not hundreds of young future farmers and transferors want to be able to make transactions. This is a global issue. This desire to transfer their farm to their children is part of what has been driving older farmers to work as hard as they do and invest so much time in it for 30, 40 or 50 years. It may even span two, three, four or five generations. Farmers work like mad to provide a future to their kids. Selling their farm to a stranger can lead to feelings of failure or profound grief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374559">For farmers, it is a big step to hand over the farm to their children out of love and devotion. That is what I have heard from FRAQ members, young and old alike, who feel concerned. Their greatest wish is to be able to hand over their farms to their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374560">I will conclude by mentioning that the tax arguments raised when the last point was rejected do not hold up well if we look at the PBO study. In my opinion, if things are not moving right now, it is because there is a flagrant lack of political will on the part of the Government of Canada. This lack of will needs to stop, and that is why the Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374562">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the NDP caucus today at second reading of Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>. We will be according our support at second reading to take it to committee. As I already indicated, we will be looking potentially for some clarifications around the bill when it goes to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374563">I need to praise Guy Caron, the former member of Parliament for Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, for his good work in advancing this issue. This is not an insignificant issue. It is extremely important for the next generation of people running small businesses across the length and breadth of our country, for family farms to be passed down from one generation to the next and for fishing corporations to be passed down as well to maintain the vital fishing industry on our coasts across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374564">These are important points that Guy Caron brought forward to Parliament which we are now debating to take to committee. These extremely important things must be put into place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374565">I am a long-time member of the New Westminster Chamber of Commerce and the Burnaby Board of Trade. Because of that long-time involvement in the Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce, I have worked with small businesses. I also ran a social enterprise myself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374566">It is extremely important to maintain those family-run businesses across the country. In many communities, family-run businesses are really the backbone of a community's economic development. Ending what is a very perverse aspect of our tax system and facilitating, in a sense, small businesses under $1 million to be passed from one generation to the next without penalties being incurred makes a big difference for family-owned business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374567">As well, I come from a farming family. My mother's family ran a farm in Alberta when it originally came from Norway and settled in the Cariboo Hill area of Burnaby. The area now known as Cariboo Park was the family farm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374568">Families that have run farms for generations have nothing but my deepest respect. Again, we have to end the perverse penalties that exist right now for families that want to pass their farms from one generation to the next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374569">I am going to set aside my speech for a moment because I would like to respond to the member for <Affiliation DbId="253010" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>, who spoke to the bill on behalf of the Liberal government. He basically questioned the impacts on the tax base of putting forward these measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374570">The Liberal government has completely collapsed the tax base in the country. I find it incredible, quite frankly, for any Liberal to stand in the House and say that he or she is concerned about the tax base for something that is of far less significance on the scale of the federal budget than it is in the positive impacts small businesses and farms would feel across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374571">The reality is, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer has pointed out, the government has undermined the tax base to the point that we lose over $25 billion a year to overseas tax havens. In terms of housing, education, health care expanding to pharmacare and dental care, $25 billion lost each and every year, $125 billion since the Liberals came to power, is an astronomical amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374572">CRA representatives who came before the finance committee indicated that the reason nobody had ever been prosecuted for the Panama papers or the paradise papers, the well-known documentation around the use of overseas tax havens, was because they had never been given the tools by the Liberal government to crack down on these overseas tax havens. For the government to pretend its concern is the tax base, when it has done anything but, as an excuse, a pretext, for opposing the bill is difficult to believe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374573">In addition, as you well know, Madam Speaker, the NDP has brought forward provisions around the wealth tax and the excess profits tax. The leader of the NDP, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, has been very clear in this respect. The federal Liberal government has simply refused to undertake those measures, even though we know Canadian billionaires have added to their wealth, over $37 billion since the beginning of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374574"> The banking sector has received over $750 billion in liquidity supports and their profits have been astronomical as well. Just in the first two quarters, over $15 billion in profits have been supported by federal government institutions, ensuring, with as much largesse as possible, that they have everything taken care of during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374575">In previous crises that the country has gone through, for example, the Second World War, there were strict laws against profiteering. There was an effective corporate tax rate to ensure we were all in this together. The government has refused to do the right thing, whether it is cracking down on overseas tax havens, bringing in a wealth tax or proposing an excess profits tax. It has undermined and destroyed our tax base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374576">What many Canadians are concerned about is the fact that this could well lead to austerity when Canadians are not getting the supports, in so many cases, they need to get through this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374577">The last point I would like to make in reply to the member for <Affiliation DbId="253010" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation> is that he seemed to be very proud about the government support for small businesses. If he spoke with small businesses, the member would know that nothing could be further from the truth. The NDP put pressure on the government to bring in the wage subsidy. The NDP was able to achieve that in this minority Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374578">However, the rent relief program was a massive failure. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252992" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation>, the NDP small business critic, has raised this repeatedly. Now we have a rent relief program that will fix all the problems with the old one, but the federal Liberal government has refused to put into place the retroactivity that would allow small business that did not get any rent relief in the first version, because it was so badly botched, to apply retroactively for rent relief. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374579">The pretensions of why Liberal members would oppose the bill are disingenuous, to say the least, when the Liberal government has done everything to destroy our tax base, while at the same time has not offered the supports for small business, which are so desperately needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374580">A number of people have talked very positively about the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374581"> Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, has said, “Many small business owners are telling us that tax rules discourage them from passing on their firm to their children.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374582">This time Mr. Kelly was speaking about Guy Caron's work, when he said that the “Bill addresses this unfairness and will help small business owners ensure their firm remains locally owned, creating and protecting local jobs.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374583">Ron Bennett, president of Canadian Federation of Agriculture, has said, “Simply put, if taxation barriers aren't addressed, we will see fewer and fewer family farms in Canada. We support Mr. Caron and his colleague's commitment to addressing these tax burdens that could cause significant administrative burden.”</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6374584">The bill introduced by Guy Caron, the former member for Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, was supported by many organizations, including the Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec, the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, the Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec, the Agricultural Alliance of New Brunswick and the Producteurs de lait du Québec, not to mention several other organizations representing supply-managed farms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374585">This is part of what should be done to preserve family farms while above all continuing to support a stronger supply management system. We will be supporting the bill and hope to discuss it at greater length in committee.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252712" Type="2">Mr. Richard Lehoux (Beauce, CPC) </Affiliation>
            </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6374586">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document>, an act to amend the Income Tax Act with regard to the transfer of a small business or family farm or fishing corporation, which was introduced by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252569" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374587">The amendments made by this bill are necessary to standardize the process for selling family businesses. These amendments would considerably improve the Income Tax Act with respect to the transfer of a small business or family farm to a family member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374588">In the current state of affairs, the sad reality faced by business owners is that they must pay more taxes if they sell to a family member than if they sell to a third party. The current act puts operators who want to transfer their family business to their son or daughter at an unfair disadvantage. This forces owners to decide whether they want to keep their life's work in the family or sell it to the highest bidder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374589">If this bill were adopted, it would facilitate many more family business successions. It would also guarantee the retirement savings that business owners worked so hard to earn and enable more local businesses to prosper, which would strengthen the Canadian economy and local economies. We must never lose sight of the fact that SMEs are the cornerstone of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374590">Everyone in the House knows a factory, a family restaurant, a corner store or a farm in their riding that has been around for generations. These family businesses are well liked and extremely important to the local economy. These small businesses are the backbone of our society. Some of these businesses not only help feed our communities, but they also provide important jobs for the people in our ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374591">The dynamic of keeping a family business in the family is unprecedented. The idea that an owner could be forced to sell their business to a third party simply because of overtaxation is simply shocking. When a third-party purchaser buys a business, many unknowns come into play. Will the new owner cut jobs? Will they move the business to a different region or even a different country? These are the questions the seller must keep in mind, but also their employees and family members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374592">We know that Beauce is a haven for SMEs. I will provide two real-life examples from my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374593">My first example is Eddy Berthiaume, the owner of Les escaliers de Beauce, located in my hometown of Saint-Elzéar, who was forced to make the difficult decision that I just explained to the House. He owned 50% of this business for many years. He is a good, hard-working man who spent years building his business. When he was ready to retire, he decided to sell his shares in the family business to his children, but unfortunately, he was unfairly forced to pay thousands of dollars in transfer fees. The worst part of this story is that his business partner was able to sell his 50% stake to a third party and pay a pittance in taxes. He paid essentially nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374594">Some may wonder how this is unfair. There are other examples like this one that show how the government is letting down business owners across the country. We need a government that is prepared to grant exemptions to Canadians and that does not penalize tenacious families like the Berthiaumes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374595">My second example is Estampro, a business in Saint-Évariste-de-Forsyth owned by the Fortin family, who dealt with the same rules for transferring the business to a family member. The business, which was founded in 1984, is already run by the third generation of Fortins. The family had to work extremely hard to get there, however. The time and money they spent on filling out forms for the transfer certainly could have been used to hire extra machinists or to make more progress on automation. Instead, the family was trapped in all of the red tape required by the existing legislation, and we cannot underestimate the impact this has had on the family. I spoke with them this week, and I know that they are seriously wondering what problems they will encounter if the business is transferred to the next generation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374596"> I am sure many of my colleagues are aware of cases like these. There are many others throughout my riding. If the House does not act now, then wonderful, healthy, viable, proudly Canadian companies will end up in the hands of people other than the families that built them or, even worse, in the hands of foreign countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374597">This bill will also help Canadian business owners by advancing women's entrepreneurship. Only 16% of businesses and 29% of family farms are majority female-owned. If the government stopped penalizing owners of small businesses and family farms who sell their businesses to their daughters, it would help foster entrepreneurship among women and increase their participation in the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374598">It is very unfortunate that our party is obliged to introduce bills like this one when we have a government that claims to always be there for women and small businesses. We need the government to get involved and quickly examine the issues raised by bills like this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374599">This bill is not partisan in any way. I think that the amendments to this private member's bill are not only a matter of fairness, as many of my colleagues mentioned, but also a matter of common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374600">I cannot believe that this government has not already introduced amendments to the Income Tax Act in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374601">We need to treat business owners fairly. These tax policies are unfair when the time comes for them to step down from their family business. Leaving a family business can be a positive thing if they know they are leaving it in the hands of someone they love and, more importantly, someone who will love and honour the values and culture of the business, as the owner did for many years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374602">Business owners should not feel like they have to sell their business to a third party simply because it will cost them less. Business owners must also obey the law. We would not want them to make concessions or act fraudulently in order to save the hard-earned pension or retirement savings they would otherwise lose in taxes. That is why it is important that Bill <Document DbId="10866042" Type="4">C-208</Document> pass in the House as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374603">I heard some of my colleagues say that changes to this bill could lead to more fraud and tax evasion. That is why our party wrote protection mechanisms into the bill. To forestall those potential problems, the bill provides that the family member purchasing the business must keep their shares for at least five years to avoid the penalty. This will thwart attempts to exploit the system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374604">Right now, and especially during this global pandemic, Canadian businesses need our help, not just to stay afloat while we fight the pandemic together, but also in the future when the time comes to sell and buy their family businesses. Canadians want to remain self-sufficient. They want to support their local businesses. Most of all, they want their local businesses to succeed from one generation to the next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374605">I hope the Conservative Party can count on all parties to vote for this bill, which is so important to our family businesses. I speak from experience, because I myself was part of the fourth generation of a family business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374607">What concerns me is that members from different political entities in the House have tried to give an impression that I do not believe is accurate. We need to recognize that virtually from day one, the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have recognized the importance of small businesses, whether they are the family farms in our rural communities or the stores and shops in our urban centres and rural communities. We have seen this amplified over the last number of months in different ways. I encourage my colleagues on all sides of the House to, at the very least, recognize some of the ways we have done that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374608"> This legislation talks about the issue of taxes, a sense of tax fairness and wanting to see family businesses continue on as much as possible through family members, in a fair fashion. On the issue of tax fairness, the government has demonstrated very clearly where our priorities have been, and we have seen significant tax changes take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374609">I want to focus, in what little time I have, on an area of concern that members have talked about in the last hour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374610">Small business is the backbone of our Canadian economy. It even goes beyond our economy, to our society and lifestyle. It has been such a positive force for decades and will continue to be a driving force into the future. That is why, virtually from day one of the pandemic, we have invested so many resources, whether through the wage subsidy program, the rent assistance program, or working with banks so small businesses would have the leverage to get the loans that are necessary.<ForceColumnBreak /></ParaText>

It is the language of a proud and open people who live and sometimes survive in the middle of a sea of anglophones. It is also the language of a respectful people who defend the rights of linguistic minorities. It is a language that is both beautiful and fragile. It is our language that we share with thousands of francophones from every region in Canada. We must love, cherish, share and protect it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374629">Today, I will talk about the French language. I will obviously do so as the member of Parliament for Honoré-Mercier, government House leader and Quebec lieutenant, but first and foremost as a Quebecker, father, friend and huge fan of Quebec music and culture. French is not my first language, but to me, it is the most beautiful language in the world. It is the language of Quebec and Quebeckers. It is a language of giants. It is the language of extraordinary people like Félix Leclerc, Réjean Ducharme, Michel Tremblay and Gaston Miron. It is also a language that is our own, the language we speak every day, the language in which we love, laugh and cry. It is the language in which we keep in touch with our friends and ask, “Hey, how's it going, big guy? What's up?” It is the language I use every night when I call my daughter. It is the language in which I have fun with my buddies and chat with my colleagues. It is the language in which we tell each other, “Hang on, we can do it, we will soldier on and make it through”, a language of survivors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374630">It is the language in which we tell bedtime stories to our little ones to help them sleep, with varying degrees of success. It is the language in which we comfort them. It is the language in which we speak with our parents and grandparents and tell them we love them. It is also in French that I learned to play songs by Harmonium, Paul Piché and Beau Dommage on the guitar—again, with varying degrees of success, but with a lot of spirit. It is the language in which my father, my mother, my sisters and I were welcomed here and immediately felt accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374631">I remember that when I first came here, I could not understand a word. I spoke only Spanish. When I came here, I learned a single word, “ici”, meaning “here.” With only three letters, it was not too hard. I ran to one place and said “ici”, then ran someplace else and repeated “ici”, and so forth. Eventually, it got a bit repetitive. I understood that I needed to hurry up and learn a few more words if I wanted to make some friends to play hockey with and play outside with. I learned French, and I learned it quickly. I fell head over heels in love with the language. It is a complex language at times, but that complexity gives rise to the subtleties and nuances that make it so beautiful. It is for these reasons, and many more, that we must do everything possible to protect it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374632">French is declining in Montreal. This concerns me as a Montrealer, as a Quebecker, and I would say as a Canadian as well. It also concerns my colleagues in other parties, I am sure. It is gut-wrenching, because we see it, we feel it and we live it. We have to keep in mind that there is no simple solution. We cannot look for a panacea that will make everything better. No single measure will fix the problem all by itself. There is no magic bullet. I believe that any solution will require a healthy dose of courage, willingness and collaboration. I mention collaboration because, obviously, the Government of Quebec has a central role to play in protecting the French language.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374633">We must work together because we can do a lot here in Ottawa to protect French in Quebec and elsewhere in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374634">The Speech from the Throne states that the federal government must protect minority language communities, be it our English-speaking friends in Quebec or our French-speaking friends outside Quebec, but that it must also protect French in Quebec. For the first time in the past 150 years, the government recognizes its responsibility to protect French in Quebec, even though it is the majority language there. It must be protected because of its minority status in the rest of Canada and North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374635">Protecting French can be done in many different ways. One of them is the modernization of the Official Languages Act, and my colleague is working on that every day. She will have an opportunity to tell us about her work a bit later. Modernizing the act will allow us to do a lot. The act is already a powerful tool, but its scope will be expanded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374636">Then there is culture. By investing in culture, we invest in our language and our identity. We have more books, television programs and music in French. Is there a better way to learn our language than by listening to Michel Rivard, Daniel Bélanger or Cœur de pirate, by watching <I>Tout le monde en parle</I>, <I>District 31</I> or <I>Infoman</I>—I am sure that Jean-René is watching us—or by attending a play at Théâtre du Nouveau Monde or Théâtre Jean-Duceppe?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374637">Culture must be protected, and protecting French is protecting culture. It can be done in traditional media, but today we ought to go much further and extend the protection online because the world has evolved. That is exactly what we are doing with our broadcasting bill. We have to legislate to protect and promote French content online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374638">Much work also needs to be done internationally, through international institutions, so that French continues to spread its influence in the world.</ParaText>

By giving them a helping hand, one way or another, we are helping small businesses in Quebec keep good jobs in Quebec. Quite often, these jobs are in French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374640">I believe everyone here acknowledges that we need to do more. We will do more, but we need to do it together. Individual actions by individual members of Parliament will not change everything. Governments can and must work together. Quebec is doing its share and will continue to do so, as will we, but all of us here must pitch in, as members of Parliament and as individuals. We have a responsibility, as individuals and as a society, to take action and rally together, to express our linguistic pride, to step up, to stand up for and promote the French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374641">We can obviously defend and promote our language through big political gestures, for example by creating programs, but small, everyday actions are just as important. I would even say that there is no small gesture, just meaningful gestures in support of our language, such as buying Quebec music and reading works by one of our many authors.</ParaText>

Like all Canadians and Quebeckers, he heard the member for Saint-Laurent question the fragility of French in Quebec in a manner that was extremely offensive. Like all Quebeckers, the political lieutenant heard his party's top official in Quebec express doubts about the fragility of French. Like all Canadians and Quebeckers, he saw two prominent Liberal Party figures back down and apologize.

              <ParaText id="6374672">Before beginning my speech, I want to address all francophones in Canada. I want to tell them that I am proud to live in a country that was born in French. French is not just an official language, it is a national language. It is part of the core identity of our country, our culture and our heritage. It is the flag of the Quebec nation, Acadians and many francophone communities across the country from Restigouche to St. Boniface and from Grande Prairie to Grand-Pré.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374673">Many Canadians have personal stories about the French language. I was born in Quebec but moved to Ontario when I was only 18 months old. Unfortunately, I had not mastered French before turning two years old. I learned French in the Canadian Armed Forces when I was 18. I am proud to be bilingual. It was important as an officer in the air force and it is important to me now as a member of Parliament. Canada's English-speaking and French-speaking politicians have a responsibility to protect the French language in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374674">Being the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada means being the leader of the party that united our country through an alliance between two founding peoples, a union that was always enriched by the contributions of first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374675">I often speak against the destruction of statues of John A. Macdonald, but I started to speak against the cancel culture three years ago by defending one of the French-speaking Fathers of Confederation, Hector Langevin. Quebec's true blue Tories played a central role in the creation of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374676">Yes, being the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada means following in the footsteps of Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir George-Étienne Cartier, monumental figures in our history who recognized that, together, we can do great things. It means leading the party that fought to include Quebec in our Constitution, with honour and enthusiasm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374677">It also means being the leader of the party that fought to recognize the Quebec nation, while the Liberals have done everything in their power over the last 60 years to suppress Quebec nationalism. The truth is that Quebeckers have always been better represented by the Conservative Party, and that still holds true today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374678">The Internet, Netflix, Instagram, Twitter, iPhones, none of that existed when the Official Languages Act was adopted. It needs to be updated. The Liberals refuse to do it quickly. They prefer to focus on other issues, they prefer discussion to action. However, what the Liberals do not want to discuss is the need for much stronger action in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374679">Montreal, the city where I was born, is the second-largest French-speaking city in the world, and it has to remain so. There are seven million francophones in Quebec in an ocean of 779 million people in North America. It is normal for Quebec to have laws in place to protect French. Not only are these laws necessary, they are desirable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374680">Between 1996 and 2016, the percentage of people whose first language is French dropped from 52% to 46%. For a long time, Liberals refused to protect French in Quebec because they did not want to harm linguistic minorities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374681">Some commentators suggested in bad faith that the anglophone minority in Quebec is the equivalent of the francophone minorities in other parts of the country. But that is a false equivalency. There is no comparison at all between the two groups in the North American context, where hundreds of millions of anglophones live. Among the two languages, only French is endangered. For Liberals, a francophone Quebec is not even a reality we have to live with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374682">For us Conservatives, a francophone Quebec is a source of pride. It is a part of a heritage we must fight for. The Conservative Party proposes to apply Bill 101 to federally regulated businesses in Quebec. We will support the measures the Legault government will take to defend French. Protecting the existence of the only francophone nation in North America is a worthy project. It is a patriotic and Canadian endeavour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374683">The Conservative Party will take part in the fight to protect and promote French in Quebec and in other parts of the country. We will step up.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6374719">Madam Chair, I rise this evening to speak about issues that I think are important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374720">I will begin by talking a little about Quebec culture. We recently talked about the program <I>La petite vie</I>. We are going to talk about it a little more. In one of the most popular episodes, Ti-Mé has a watch that vibrates when he tells a lie. If it were the member for <Affiliation DbId="252678" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>, his arm would have fallen off a few minutes ago. Saying that applying the Charter of the French Language to federally regulated businesses was the NDP's idea is just one of the countless foolish things that those members have said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374721">However, I have good thoughts and good words for the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. I understand that the official opposition will support this bill. I believe that his affection for the French language is sincere. The leader of the opposition's fluency in French has improved dramatically since he took up his current position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374722">I respectfully submit to his attention, however, that Quebeckers are not asking federalist parties to protect French. They are asking federalist parties to respect Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction and the absolute legitimacy of Quebeckers when it comes to protecting their national language. This belongs to Quebeckers only.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374723">If the Official Languages Act is to play a role for all francophones outside Quebec and for our Acadian friends, we will be very happy to be their voice here, in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374724">In fact, the Bloc Québécois put forward a bill to apply the Charter of the French Language to federally regulated businesses. The Bloc Québécois also introduced a bill which would mandate a minimal knowledge of French for any person wishing to become a Canadian citizen while living in Quebec. I again count on the support of the Conservatives, given their respect for the French language in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374725">Recently, the Liberal Party of Canada swept under the rug, a very thick rug given the amount of dust piling up, the comments of Liberal figures, taken from a whole anthology which was alluded to. The same party, instead of taking its responsibilities regarding French and the official languages, wants to have a white paper. That is an excellent name because its pages will probably be completely white also. It will be an utterly empty document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374726">Lastly, there is Bill <Document DbId="10926636" Type="3">C-10</Document> on broadcasting. The minister bragged about the fact that the industry did not ask for a minimal percentage of French content. What a feat! Welcome to the Liberal Party, where people are thrilled to see there is no obligation regarding French content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374727">The Liberal Party is a bit stuck. Given the attention that this subject is attracting, the Liberals could very well lose a lot of ground in Quebec by going that route. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374728">Why would the issue of French be dealt with differently this time? After all, this issue has been raised many times. The Quebec National Assembly has frequently spoken out about it. The federal government has attacked French many times. Those attacks have been accumulating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374729">A few months ago, the Liberal Party, mainly through its NDP butlers, started sending the message that the Bloc Québécois is a bunch of racists. The same thing was being said about the Government of Quebec and, by extension, all Quebeckers since they support the Quebec government's policies. Quebeckers got fed up and said that they supported the state secularism law and Quebec values on freedom of expression. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374730">Once again, there were attacks and a denigration of the French language condoned by the highest power in this country. Of course the jurisdictions and expertise of this government are highly questionable. We will not get into the issue of vaccines again. We will come back to that another time.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374731">The issue of language has come up again at a time when there is friction. Quebeckers are fed up, not just of being told what to do, but even worse, of being told that they do not have the right to be. For a long time, Quebec society has been seen as a bunch of hippies with flowers in their hair and with very left-wing values. Perhaps that is not too far off the mark. A lot of work went into giving Quebeckers a bad reputation, even though Quebec is a progressive, welcoming and generous society. At a certain point, people get fed up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374732">That is the context in which the issue of language has come up again. The argument that this is discrimination against anglophones, a historic minority, comes up again and again. I always say that Quebec would not be what it is today without that valuable contribution. This is a source of some confusion, but the historic anglophone minority in western Quebec, which now extends well beyond Montreal, has rights and privileges. Of all the rights and privileges enjoyed by the anglophone community, the right to integrate immigrants who choose Quebec into the English-speaking community is not one of them. There is no such thing. The national and common language in Quebec, the only official language in Quebec, is French. In exchange for the generous welcome offered by Quebeckers, those who choose Quebec, who are most welcome of course, are legitimately expected to have a minimum knowledge of this language. This seems to be a value, a request, a healthy and legitimate expectation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374733">I would go even further and say that the generous welcome offered to immigrants comes with obligations. When I talk about the integration of immigrants, more often than not, I am talking about economic integration rather than cultural and linguistic integration. Indeed, the main thing these individuals want when they choose Quebec is to rebuild their lives there with a minimum chance of prosperity. This brings us back to language. Language proficiency is the first and most important tool for harmonious economic, social and cultural integration in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374734">Quebec would not be doing its job if it did not ensure that all people who live on the inalienable territory of Quebec have at least a minimum knowledge of French. It is our duty, economically as well as linguistically and culturally, and for the survival of the nation and the culture that we represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374735">For all these reasons, the issue must indeed come up again. The first tool for many things is a common language, and the common language in Quebec, no matter what some Liberals might say, will not be English. Let us be very clear, that language is French. That is what Quebeckers want. Good old-fashioned guilt trips will not work on Quebeckers anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374736">I will conclude by saying this: People can go ahead, keep on provoking Quebeckers, but they should watch out. Once Quebec stands up, it will not stop.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374769">Madam Chair, I am very pleased to rise to speak this evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374770">I would like to start along the same lines as the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">Leader of the Government</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263909" Type="7">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> and point out that there are 78 members of Parliament from Quebec, and each one of these members is as legitimate as the others. The NDP represents 454,000 Quebeckers, which is not insignificant and must be respected in our discussions in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374771">No one has a monopoly over Quebec or over defending the interests of Quebec or the French language. I think this is something we all care about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374772"> I am so proud to participate virtually in this evening's debate because the French language is something I hold very dear. I was fortunate to grow up and live in a home filled with French books, songs, movies and music. The songs of Félix Leclerc and Gilles Vigneault filled my childhood and teenage years. I was immersed in the music of Pauline Julien, Gérald Godin, Claude Gauthier, Robert Charlebois and Diane Dufresne. I could not get enough of Quebec comedians like Yvon Deschamps, Les Cyniques and Sol, and of French comedians Pierre Desproges and Raymond Devos. They were all so unbelievably talented at eloquently using the language, making us laugh and also making us think, all of which made me want to understand and learn more about the beautiful French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374773">That is why debates like the one we are having tonight are so important, because this is not simply about a bill or a motion. For many Quebeckers, as well as Acadians and francophones outside Quebec, I am sure, it is a vital and fundamental issue that goes to the core of who we are collectively and individually. Quebec's language and culture are inextricably intertwined. I think this debate is extremely important and needs to take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374774">I heard a lot of partisan attacks in the previous interventions. I am not saying I will shy away from those completely, but I will try to refocus the debate on verifiable, objective facts that will help us assess the situation, and on constructive suggestions for improving the defence and promotion of French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374775">Last week, I was proud to be the member moving a motion calling for the French language to be defended and promoted in Quebec and across Canada. That motion was passed unanimously by the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374776">Let me point out that, according to 2018 stats, 94.5% of people in Quebec are able to have a conversation in French. We can agree that it is not necessarily a very sophisticated or complex conversation, but it shows that all the hard work of past years is bearing fruit. Michel C. Auger mentioned that percentage when he was on <I>Tout le monde en parle</I> two years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374777">There are four indicators for the French language: mother tongue, language spoken at home, language used in public, and language of work. Personally, I do not feel they are all equal because I think language of work and language used in public are the most important indicators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374778">There has been a slight decline in the use of French at home. From 1996 to 2016, 82% of households spoke French regularly, but not exclusively, at home. That percentage dropped to 79% in 2016, a slight decline of 3%.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374779">The numbers for spoken language at home by immigrants, by newcomers, are interesting. Before 1981, only 30% of them adopted French, nearly 33% opted for English and 37% used a language other than French or English. Between 2011 and 2016, more than 41% of newcomers adopted French, 49% chose a language other than French or English and only 9% chose English. In 30 years, we have seen an increase in the use of French at home by newcomers. A 2011 report by the Office québécois de la langue française found that a growing number of immigrants chose French over English as the language of use at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374780">The real problem, and this is why it is important to have this discussion, is the language of work. According to a 2019 report by the Office québécois de la langue française, French is in decline in retail businesses. People are more often welcomed in English or in a bilingual manner than before. The same report also noted that once the desire to be served in French was expressed, the person received the service in French in Montreal more than 85% of the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374781">There is a problem of perception and hospitality, but it is no catastrophe. We must be vigilant and we need to do more, but we also need to make decisions based on objective facts and the reality on the ground. Efforts do need to be made to help businesses, especially those with 25 to 50 employees, report more to the Quebec government on the linguistic quality of the services offered by their employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374782">I want to commend the work being done in this area by the Quebec labour movement, especially the FTQ and the CSN, which work mainly in the private sector. They have good programs and work a great deal on French integration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374783">French integration is key. Bill 101 must apply to companies under federal jurisdiction. That has been part of our platform since the days of Jack Layton. It was taken up by Nycole Turmel and Thomas Mulcair, as well as our current leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>. It is also a question of equal rights for workers. They must have access to documents in French in the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374784">The matter of French integration is a major issue. I think that considerable efforts must be made to improve access to French language courses by making them free for newcomers. Right now, they face obstacles, such as the requirement to get a study permit. These obstacles may have been put there by the Government of Quebec or to the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374785">Some members of my staff teach French to newcomers. They tell me that people who do not yet have permanent status have a hard time accessing French classes. This is a major problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374786">When the leader of the NDP and I met with the Premier of Quebec before the last federal election, we made it clear that there must be sufficient federal resources to help Quebec teach newcomers French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374787">There are other things that can and must be done as well. I think that has already been said tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374788">The bill to renew the Broadcasting Act was tabled recently. It is vital to establish very clear goals, principles, approaches and directives for the CRTC, but also for the Canada Media Fund and the Canadian Television Fund, in order to have the necessary resources to create original French-language content, as opposed to translated content. We must secure the means to do it, whether through CRTC regulations, general policy or directives to the CRTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374789">In my view, the Bloc Québécois bill requiring French tests for refugees and family reunification applicants is inappropriate and would be hard to implement in reality. It is kind of a bogus solution, not a real solution to a real problem. That is why we in the NDP are quite critical of the idea at this time.</ParaText>

I remind the member that there are three types of immigration: economic immigration, which is managed exclusively by Quebec and which awards significantly more points for knowledge of French; family reunification; and refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374796">I find it hard to justify the idea of forcing a French test on people applying for family reunification or on refugees who are fleeing poverty, war or exploitation. In addition, the argument for requiring French tests does not account for movement between provinces. If someone becomes a citizen in Ontario, Nova Scotia or British Columbia and then moves to Montreal, any theoretical benefit of this bill is lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374797">In our opinion, this is not fair to refugees, and it would be hard to enforce when someone moves between provinces. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374810">I find that extremely fascinating. It is a wonderful story. Now Quebeckers know that, in his teenage years, as part of his personal and family life, he chose to learn French out of curiosity and a love of that language. I think that will resonate with many Quebeckers. I also think that he was absolutely right in saying that we need to invest the necessary resources in teaching French to newcomers. The NDP prefers to take a constructive, positive approach that helps people to learn the beautiful language of Molière and integrate into society. We do not want a restrictive or punitive approach, particularly if it is less effective and harder to enforce. That is why, in my opinion, the New Democrats committed to not only apply Bill 101 to federally regulated businesses but also to allocate additional resources to French education.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374811">Mr. Speaker, my colleague quoted Yvon Deschamps during his short presentation. Yvon Deschamps was a master of irony, which is a convenient little device that allows us to say the opposite of what we really mean. People use irony often. I think it is funny coming from my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252678" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>, especially when he tries to claim the NDP was behind the legislation to apply Bill 101 to federal jobs. Sadly for him, that is not so. It was the MP Pauline Picard who introduced the bill for the first time in 2007. As is often the case when Quebeckers are interested in something, the Bloc Québécois made the first move and introduced a bill like that one. The NDP picked the idea up afterward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374812">The irony does not stop there. The NDP's strong presence here today illustrates how important its members think French is. The seats are all full. What a strong contingent. I would like my colleague to set the record straight, at least. When he spoke to the leader earlier, he said it was an NDP idea. If he has any decency, he will set the record straight.</ParaText>

It is not only a good way to defend and promote French, but it is also a concept that affects equal rights for workers. We want employees at Caisse Desjardins and employees at Royal Bank to have access to the same rights, the same services in French and the same job contracts in French. We are so in favour of workers' rights that unlike the Bloc Québécois, we have never voted in favour of closure to impose back-to-work legislation in order to prevent striking workers from exercising their right to strike. That is what the Bloc Québécois did in 2009.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374827">It is a privilege for me to speak this evening to a topic that combines my two great loves: the French language and the City of Montreal, my language and my city. Both need our attention and some serious help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374828">Montreal has been hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis, which has emptied all the high-rises downtown and brought many of our businesses to the brink. Montreal, which had excellent momentum before the pandemic, is now a shadow of its former self, according to some observers. However, I know that with love and attention it will rebound.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374829">Then there is the status of the French language in our Quebec metropolis, which everyone is talking about lately, and rightly so. The issue of the French language in Quebec and in Montreal is fundamental, and we have to do everything we can to protect it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374830">I come from the Joly branch of the family with roots in Saint-Canut and the Racine branch from Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines. I can trace 13 generations of francophones in Quebec. I still tease my mom when she sometimes tries to use her English. As a teacher, my mother, Laurette, did everything she could to pass on to us, her three children, her love of French. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374831">We had big families where I come from. We would get together regularly, and during the holidays, we would always watch <I>Bye Bye</I> on French CBC. About 40 of us would crowd around the television. Christmas and New Year's Eve celebrations were always fun. All my life and to this day, I laugh, I cry and I love in French. I learn and I work in French. I live every day in French with Félix, whose grandmother, Gabrielle, fled Germany during the Second World War.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374832">As Quebeckers and Canadians, we must constantly remind ourselves that we are francophones in America, having come from around the globe, a linguistic minority in an immense space, and we are therefore in a situation of survival. We must always do more and go a little further than what is expected of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374833">Our government recognizes that and offered a historic recognition in the Speech from the Throne last September. We recognize that we have a responsibility to protect and promote French, not only outside Quebec, but also within its borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374834">It is with that objective in mind that we will modernize and strengthen our Official Languages Act, and we will do it properly because it is too important for our country and our identity. This means that we must have the courage of our ambitions, ask tough questions and draw the necessary conclusions, such as the decline of the French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374835">It also means that all of us here are duty bound to work together, not against each other, to strengthen our French language in Quebec and in Canada. Language-related anxiety is very real among Canadians and we have to take appropriate measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374836">I am extremely concerned by the data that shows a decline in the use of French in Montreal. Obviously, people should have access to services in French in their day-to-day lives. As a francophone, I want to be able to go to a coffee shop and be served in French. I want to make sure that my children will grow up and get a good education in French in my own city.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374837">Passing on one's language is integral to our identity, our roots. Every parent would say how important it is. It is visceral. It is an issue that touches us deeply at the very core of our being and, as a Montrealer, proud member of Parliament for Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Minister of Official Languages, I want to tell people that I hear them and I understand them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374838">We will work together to ensure that Montreal remains Quebec's crown jewel of the French language for the generations to come. All levels of government need to participate, and we must all work together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374839">Let us be clear: The common language in Quebec is French. Any work to strengthen one person's rights must not come at the expense of another's.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374840">The city of Montreal is woven together by diverse cultures and steeped in the history of the francophone and anglophone communities that have been coexisting, intermingling and working together to build a future for generations. Has it always been that simple? No, it has not, but this intricacy, this mosaic, makes the city stronger and fuels creativity. French has flourished for years and continues to do so, thanks to the existing laws and strong institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374841">Today, the conclusion is rather simple. We must do more. Times have changed, and society has as well. I urge those elected officials who are tempted to turn official languages into a political issue to take a step back. We can all work together to strengthen the French language in Montreal and ensure that everyone's rights, including those of the anglophone minority, are respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374842">I hope we can rise above partisanship in this debate, above the notion of “Montreal versus everyone else”, above the divisions that are so easy to create. When Montreal is doing well, all of Quebec does well and breathes a little easier, and so does the entire country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374843">As we deal with the COVID-19 crisis, which is, let's face it, already extremely stressful, now is not the time to exacerbate tensions. Rather, we need to defuse them. This is the time to be conciliatory. We owe it to our fellow citizens. I know that I have valued allies among my francophone and anglophone colleagues. Regardless of our origins, this is a subject that motivates us and brings us together. Our language is beautiful; we must take care of it and we must be proud of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374844">Let us work together as members in this House, with all governments and citizens, so that Montreal, a francophone city, a city of students, a Quebec metropolis, remains the crown jewel of La Francophonie in the Americas and keeps inspiring the entire world.

              <ParaText id="6374849">All this to say that I understand that we need to take action. Our government has recognized the importance of taking action. We have done so for the past five years, by bringing out a historic plan for official languages, saving CBC/Radio-Canada, doubling the budget of the Canada Council for the Arts, and providing funding for the French-language military college in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, which had stopped granting university degrees and educating our soldiers in French. We also restored French-language services and were able to reinstate the court challenges program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374850">We did so much that, while we were doing all that work, we said that we absolutely had to go back to the beginning, to the legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who introduced new official languages legislation in 1969, after the Laurendeau-Dunton commission.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374853">He was very contemptuous of Bill 101 and said that it was pushing us backwards. Then he brought in the Official Languages Act at a time when francophones were suffering significant economic discrimination and when French was very much in retreat. When it comes to official languages programs, all the money goes exclusively to supporting English.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374854">Second, the principle behind the Official Languages Act runs counter to Bill 101, which is based on a model focused more on collective and territorial rights, meaning that, in a given territory, there needs to be a common language in order to integrate newcomers. In contrast, the Official Languages Act model promotes institutional bilingualism and sends newcomers the message that they can adopt the language of their choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374855">Quebec is still part of Canada, unfortunately, and we are part of that minority that was recognized for the first time in the Speech from the Throne. Given this reality, there is a natural tendency for newcomers to choose English. The problem is that newcomers are not being integrated enough. It is the very foundation of the Official Languages Act that runs counter to Bill 101.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374857">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for pointing out that this is the first time in 43 Parliaments that a federal government has recognized that French is a minority language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374858">However, one very important fact must be made clear, namely that the Government of Canada is the Government of Quebec's main partner in French integration for immigrants. It is a mistake to say that the Government of Canada only supports English in Quebec. In reality, under the Canada-Quebec accord on immigration, the Government of Canada transfers a large amount of money to the Government of Quebec, which then uses it to teach newcomers French. That makes us a partner and an ally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374859">It goes without saying that immigrants in Quebec must have opportunities to speak the language. That is why we have this agreement, which has been in place since 1988. That is also why I have had several discussions on these issues with Quebec's immigration minister and the minister responsible for the French language. We must always do more, and it is a challenge to integrate immigrants in French not only in Quebec, but also in the rest of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374860">We know that the issue of francophone immigration is important, as is the demographic weight of francophones. This is why, as minister, I had the opportunity to announce for the first time a francophone minority immigration strategy. One million francophones outside Quebec fight every day to speak French. It is a choice to speak French when you are in a minority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374861">Our government must therefore be there to support strong institutions, so that these people are able to speak their language, in Ontario or elsewhere, and so that an entire community can maintain its wonderful vitality. The arrival of newcomers who join these minority communities will help achieve this goal. This is why francophone minority immigration is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374862">I simply wanted to correct my colleague with kindness and much respect. This was just one example. I could give him another one, involving support for arts and culture and for broadcasting. No one here thinks that Radio-Canada is not important to Quebec. It is one of the largest federal institutions, and we reinvested $675 million in it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374869">I appreciated the speech by my colleague, and I have two questions for her, to which we would like clear answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374870">First, does she agree that Bill 101 should apply to federally regulated businesses in Quebec? I ask this because these businesses still do not guarantee their employees the right to work in French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374871">Second, does she agree that the Official Languages Act must be strengthened to give people the right to receive services in French across Canada, including in British Columbia?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374872">Mr. Speaker, I want to tell my colleague that it is always inspiring to hear him speak French, since he speaks it so very well. I have a lot of respect for him, and I am pleased to be able to count him as an ally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374873">I heard his first question on Bill 101. I am already in contact with my provincial counterpart, Simon Jolin-Barrette, the minister responsible for this file. He is working on his own reform, and we are waiting for more information. I am naturally looking forward to his response, but we are continuing to work together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374874">As for my colleague's second question about strengthening the Official Languages Act, the objective is, of course, for anyone to have access to high-quality services in French in British Columbia, for example. That is exactly the objective of strengthening the act. I would be happy to share more information with him in the coming weeks.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6374875">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to participate in this debate, especially this week because the eldest of my five children, Amélie, just gave birth to my fifth grandchild, my second grandson, my little Arthur. There is bound to be a tear in my eye, proof that people soften with age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374876">I came here in 2006 as a unilingual francophone parliamentarian. I was born in a little village called Saint-Narcisse-de-Beaurivage. I am proud of my roots, my language, and the unique aspects of my francophone culture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374877">I want to say how touching it is to hear our children and grandchildren say their first French words and write their name so proudly for the first time. Moments like those and many more are priceless as we watch our little ones go to school and learn to speak and write French. Being born into a French-speaking environment and being able to live in French is a precious inheritance and the basis of a culture that makes us unique, expressive and undeniably warm-hearted thanks to our rich vocabulary and the variety of words with which we can express our feelings and emotions so incredibly precisely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374878">I am also very thankful to my late mother, Rita Boissonneault, who shared her love and knowledge with me throughout my childhood. The term “mother tongue” is very apt, as our first language generally comes from our mother or whoever acts in that role for us. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the exceptional work that mothers do for their children and, in turn, for our francophone community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374879">I want to tell members what is really on my mind. I believe that Quebeckers and Canadians did not realize all of the risks involved in electing this Liberal government that was full of promises but that has led us down so many dead-end roads. We are learning the hard way. The protection of French and official languages is no exception. Today, we are afraid and, unfortunately, the Liberals know that people do not realize how bad a situation has become until that delicate balance is jeopardized or, worse, put to the test. Sometimes it is because we are naive or because we are dealing with many different concerns that we do not realize that we are on the brink of disaster and how important it is to protect our roots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374880">Right now, one inevitable fact remains: we must take action. As a person who only speaks French, it was a privilege for me to be a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages when our country was skilfully led by a Conservative government, with a Prime Minister worthy of that title who was always committed to beginning his speeches in French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374881">It was not out of opportunism, unlike what our colleagues from the Bloc are doing. They are having fun right now trying to make us believe they have good intentions. I would remind the House that our government was the first to recognize the Quebec nation within a united Canada. I am still proud of that today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374882">To simply declare tonight that French is in decline would of course be pointless. What we need are strategies and an action plan combining all our efforts to implement the new Roadmap for Canada's Official Languages and to get results. Clearly, the government is doing nothing to fix this situation. It is just making lots of errors of judgment and action, preventing it from taking the correct path to protect French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374883">This brings WE Charity to mind. Not only was it a corruption scandal involving an untendered contract, but it was awarded to a unilingual anglophone organization, thus excluding francophone companies. I am also thinking of the text messages sent in English only for the COVID Alert app. Finally, I am thinking of unilingual English labelling of products to fight the pandemic, to name just a few. The Liberals have yet to come up with a timeline for modernizing the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374884">On August 26, the Government of Quebec and the minister responsible for the French language, Simon Jolin-Barrette, announced their plans to take action to strengthen the position of French in Quebec, stating that they wanted Bill 101 to apply to federally regulated businesses operating in Quebec, such as banks and VIA Rail. It is perfectly legitimate for the Quebec government to want to protect its language and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374885">In addition, the Commissioner of Official Languages, Raymond Théberge, released his annual report on September 29. It contains three recommendations, including a recommendation to modernize the Official Languages Act and a recommendation to go beyond the action plan for official languages 2018-23.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374886">He recommended that we invest in our future, in the promotion of the country's linguistic duality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374887">Finally, the commissioner also stated that the obvious lack of bilingual services puts public safety at risk. He believes that the failures with respect to the official languages since the beginning of the health crisis put public safety at risk, and so do I. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374888">I would like to briefly state what the Conservatives would do and require.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374889">The Conservative Party believes that it is vital that we modernize the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374890">The Conservative Party recognized the Quebec nation and is a strong supporter of the French language in all francophone communities outside Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374891">On September 14, our leader met with François Legault and confirmed that he agreed with Quebec's demand that Bill 101 apply to federally regulated businesses operating in the province. The Conservative Party supports the application of Bill 101 to federally regulated businesses in Quebec. It goes without saying that this is about respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374892">The Conservative Party wants to expand the mandate of the Official Languages Commissioner to include a review of services in French for all francophones across the country. In the last election campaign, the Conservatives promised to require all federal departments to have plans and objectives to improve their services in both languages, and we would also have liked to expand this approach to federally regulated businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374893">A Conservative government led by our leader will modernize the Official Languages Act to adapt it to today's reality without delay. The Conservative Party is calling on the <Affiliation DbId="253406" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> to provide reasons for the delay. The Conservative Party is urging the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Minister of Canadian Heritage to provide a timeline for the modernization of the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374894">Many of us here in the House can legitimately speak to the importance of defending and preserving French both in Quebec and outside Quebec, as a mother tongue and language of work, but very few of us are truly able to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374895">The Liberals have proven to be utterly disappointing, and the Bloc, for its part, can talk all it wants, but we all know it will never be able to do anything since it can never form a government here in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374896">History has always proven that the francophones in our country and especially in Quebec have a very great sense of leadership for preserving their language and francophone values. The example of the debate this evening is living proof of that leadership and reminds us that these moments of awareness encourage many Quebeckers to take all the necessary steps to ensure the preservation of our very beautiful French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374897">In my opinion, solutions will come from all of us in the larger French-speaking community. It will come from stakeholders who put their heart and soul into defending what is vital for us. Our perseverance in our struggles has always made the difference, as well as the great francophone solidarity, which I consider to be a unique phenomenon, when we face the common challenge to safeguard our French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374898">Little individual actions can add up to create an unprecedented collective effort, and the story of our presence here, in America, is a living proof of that principle. We can support our French communities in several ways, and the overhaul of the Official Languages Act becomes important and unavoidable in the debate we are having tonight. Not to mention that granting Quebec's request for greater autonomy in areas of culture and immigration could, in the long run, help protect French in Quebec and by extension in the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374899">Therefore I humbly submit my thoughts and I hope, as a father and grandfather, that my heartfelt appeal will be heard: We must unite and rally behind the only party capable of protecting our French language, which is so dear to us, and ensuring its sustainability. We must elect a new Conservative government at the next general election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374900">The love and deep affection felt by all francophones for their language unite them behind a common goal which goes beyond the personal interests of each person. What makes a huge difference as far as results are concerned is the sum of all our actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374901">To the entire francophone community which I represent with pride and dignity, I say that we have to face adversity, stand together, be prolific in our initiatives and remain faithful to our origins. Each era has its challenge, and the election coming up in the next months will be vital for what happens next.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="20">(2020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6374902">To conclude, I will say that it is all about making choices, and people can take my word for it that I will make all possible efforts to ensure the prosperity and the influence of my mother tongue for the good of all of us in Parliament and in all my daily activities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374909">The Bloc Québécois is here to defend the interests of Quebec and to speak on behalf of the Quebec National Assembly when it adopts unanimous motions. The two main parties have not historically been reliable in this respect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374911">We have heard a lot of emotional speeches this evening, and while I love them, the Liberals need to remember that they are in government.

In a few months, the Conservative Party is going to end up on the other side of the House with the help of 32 to 40 ridings in Quebec, no doubt, and those ridings will all be well represented.

When he was a member of Stephen Harper's government, Mr. Harper was not shy about appointing unilingual anglophones to all sorts of key positions. Take, for example, Michael Ferguson's appointment as Auditor General or the judges who were appointed to the Supreme Court. The Conservative government at the time said that the positions had been posted but that no qualified bilingual candidates had applied and so it had no choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374919">Does the member not agree that, in order to be appointed to the highest court in the country, candidates must be bilingual and able to hear cases in both French and English?

Our numbers keep increasing, and the contribution of the francophone caucus in the Conservative Party has been making quite a difference since 2006. I have witnessed that every day since then.

              <ParaText id="6374934">Our party, and of course his party, along with all our colleagues in Quebec, wants to defend the French language to the best of our ability. The problem we are currently having with this government is that it does not keep its promises. One of its key promises in recent years was that it would modernize the Official Languages Act, but that has not yet been done. We are still waiting, and it plans to put out a white paper to once again delay the tabling of a modernized official languages act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374935">I would like my colleague to speak about this.</ParaText>

We are asking for the modernization of the official languages. It is important to do this after 50 years. In 1988, some progress was made under a Conservative government. The time has come. In a few months, the next Conservative government will make it a priority.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374938">Mr. Speaker, I will share my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252496" Type="2">Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374939">Aside from being a means of communication, language is also an expression of our culture. It tells our stories and accompanies our dreams. Language gives us the ability to understand and help each other, and it helps us move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374940">Our sense of belonging to a community is built around a common language. Language and culture are passed on in various ways, through literature, visual arts, music, science, history, philosophy or dance. Among the main instruments of cultural transmission are television and radio. A long time ago other legislators in the House realized that and started demanding that television and radio contribute to the production of Canadian stories. Their decision was greatly beneficial to our cultural landscape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374941">However, the definition of television and radio has changed a lot since the last time the Broadcasting Act was updated, 30 years ago. In those days, we did not have touch screens or voice-activated devices. We were lucky if we could get the remote control to work on the first try. Nevertheless our laws remained unchanged since that distant past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374942">That is why I introduced Bill <Document DbId="10926636" Type="3">C-10</Document> a few days ago. Its objective is simple: to extend the scope of the Broadcasting Act to online broadcasting services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime or Spotify, and ensure that they too contribute to the production of Canadian stories, including francophone stories. It is a matter of fairness. The web giants can no longer ignore Canada's francophones and their culture. This is particularly important because francophones and their language and culture are a minority in North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374943">In order to preserve French under such circumstances, we need more than just good intentions. That is why robust legislation is so important. Bill C-10 is a way of telling francophone artists that there is no us without them. Our reform recognizes the specific challenges they are facing and addresses them directly. Their work deserves to be more well known and better funded and broadcast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374944">Finally, I want to talk about Montreal, a francophone city that is rich in culture and heritage. It has been my adopted home for over 30 years. From the early days of radio and television, creators have looked for ways to represent and reflect all aspects of life in Montreal in their productions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374945">It has been captured in such songs as <I>Je reviendrai à Montréal</I> by Robert Charlebois and <I>Montréal</I> by Ariane Moffat. On screen, the city and its inhabitants have been immortalized in documentaries such as the recent <I>Chef en pandémie</I>, series such as <I>District 31</I> and <I>La vie, la vie</I>, the children's show <I>Passe-Partout</I>, and Montreal's distinct alleyways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374946">There are also those who make us laugh in French: Catherine Éthier, Eddy King, Rosalie Vaillancourt and Adib Alkhalidey. The Couscous Comedy Show stage in Montreal has launched quite a few acts now appearing on television and Apple Music.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374947">In essence, Montreal inspires and sets the tone. It is a place where people can connect, where francophone productions around the world can collaborate. Montreal's stories, francophone stories, are there. They need to be seen and heard. Our children and grandchildren deserve to see themselves in those characters. They deserve a chance to write those stories themselves someday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374948">In 2016, I was honoured to be awarded the Impératif français prize for my contribution to the vitality of the language. It is not, however, my mother tongue. I learned to speak English before I learned to speak French. Switching from an English school to a French one was not without its challenges, but my mother felt that I ought to learn this beautiful language, and I have cultivated it throughout my life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374949">Winning the prize did not strike me as an end in itself. It was just a sign that I had to keep doing that work. Today, that commitment has brought me to my work as Minister of Canadian Heritage. Those who work to ensure the vitality of our language and our culture and to pass it on to others can count on our government to support, recognize and applaud their efforts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374972">My question to the minister is quite simple. He and his party were elected a year ago on the promise that they would modernize the Official Languages Act. As we know, the act first saw the light of day 51 years ago under Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Canada's 15th prime minister. There was an update in 1988 under Brian Mulroney. It goes without saying that another modernization is in order after 51 years. It is obvious.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6374976">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in tonight's debate about the French language in Canada. It is very motivating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374977">I want to talk a little bit about my life. I am an Acadian from Nova Scotia. My ancestors arrived here in 1604. I am originally from Cape Breton, or more specifically from a little island just next door to Cape Breton called Isle Madame, which has a population of 3,500, 95% of whom are Acadian. I also have ancestors who contributed to the prosperity of Lévis. Their important role was even recognized with a monument that was built for Canada's centennial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374978">My father told me that, in the 1960s, there was only one French course at the school that I was attending in Nova Scotia and it was at risk of being cut. He said that we had to fight to protect our language. Thanks to the Liberal Party, which passed the Official Languages Act in 1969, we finally had the support we needed. My father said that we were going to see French thrive in our community, in Quebec and in Canada. We saw our brothers and sisters in Quebec as the leading champions of the French language and culture and as people who supported us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374979">I did all my schooling in English because there was no French school in those days. Again, in 1982, it was the Liberal Party who introduced the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with section 23 protecting the rights of the anglophone minority in Quebec and the francophone minorities in the rest of Canada. We got some support from that. Then we went to court to defend our rights, obviously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374980">Lastly, French schools and francophone school councils started being created in 1990. In 2005 I was appointed as superintendent of the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial. From 2005 until today, the number of students nearly doubled in francophone schools of Nova Scotia. We are very proud of that and we continue our work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374981">In the 1960s, French declined in Montreal. I remember my father telling me that story. Then in the 1970s, the language became stronger. Indeed a decline can be observed today. It is very important to act, and that is the reason why the Liberal Party is now taking action. In the Speech from the Throne, our government clearly demonstrated that the French language needed to be promoted and protected. That call to action was well received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374982">Benoît Pelletier said, and I quote, “The federal government has always wanted to ensure symmetry between English and French in Canada. Ottawa's acknowledgement that special measures need to be taken for francophones demonstrates the Trudeau government's recognition that French is under threat.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374983">Between 2015 and now, we have taken a great deal of action. The Official Languages Act just celebrated its 50th anniversary, and we will continue to work to promote French in Quebec. We will promote both linguistic cultures in Canada: English in Quebec and French outside of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374984">We can promote French in Quebec without infringing on minority rights. Yes, we can. I must say thank you to my hon. colleagues, my sisters and brothers in Quebec. I have seen how strongly they believe in francophones outside Quebec. They have made a difference by supporting Ontario's French-language university. I congratulate and thank them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374985">Promoting bilingualism in Canada and both linguistic communities is extremely important. Bilingualism is an asset for Canada. Our colleague, the Hon. Stéphane Dion, once said that bilingualism is an asset for the country's prosperity and that Canada's bilingual character increases the volume of its trade and economic relations, which are very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6374986">I will conclude by saying that a bilingual Canada is strong, and a francophone Quebec is very strong. A Canada with two strong linguistic minorities is very important. The Liberal government will work hard to ensure the promotion and protection of French across the country. </ParaText>

This is not a criticism; on the contrary, it is charming. However, I am asking for my colleague's opinion on the two concrete measures we are proposing to advance the French language. We usually hear that they are working hard for the middle class. This evening, we are hearing that they are working hard for the French language. We want more than that; we want measures. There are two measures: Welcoming new residents in French and letting Quebeckers work in their language.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375003">Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure and privilege of participating in this debate on the status of the French language, in particular in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375004">I am moved by all of the speeches I have heard and by a warmth in the House that is radiating all the way here, in Lévis. I applaud my colleagues for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375005">This evening, I will try to speak a little more slowly than normal, because I was not able to get my speech to the interpreters. Essentially, my message is that our linguistic duality is an asset, a part of the Canadian identity. Of course, language and culture go hand in hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375006">This evening, we have seen this culture shine. Members have been naming artists and all kinds of cultural events. This is all part of and helps shape our Canadian identity, and Canadians recognize that it is an integral part of our identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375007">We are currently facing the challenge of maintaining that duality. The French language, one of our two linguistic engines is facing some significant challenges. The decline of the French language affects our linguistic duality and goes to the very heart of our Canadian identity, which is why this debate is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375008">Members mentioned the roadmaps implemented by former minister Stéphane Dion. Stephen Harper's Conservative government worked with the former premier of New Brunswick, Bernard Lord, to create two roadmaps to promote and strengthen official language minority communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375009">I heard my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252524" Type="2">Lévis—Lotbinière</Affiliation> mention the Stephen Harper government's contribution to the promotion of linguistic duality, and that reminded me of a story. I was in Mexico with Mr. Harper, President Barack Obama and the former Mexican president, Mr. Peña Nieto. As always, Mr. Harper made a point of starting his speeches in French. Some U.S. networks even cut him off because they thought it was a foreign language. At the time, Mr. Obama just said that he agreed with everything Mr. Harper had said in French. Clearly, it is an effective diplomatic language. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375010">Canada's linguistic duality has deep roots. It is said that French is the country's founding language. <Affiliation DbId="252511" Type="2">René Arseneault</Affiliation> reminded us that the Acadians were there. The first French governors spoke French. Then the English made a contribution, and it is because of that pact that, today, we have a Canadian community that is open to the world and that also includes indigenous communities. At the core of this Canadian pact is the backbone of our identity and language, namely English and French. That is the challenge that we are facing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375011">Others have faced this challenge before us when the Official Languages Act was enacted 50 years ago. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252618" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> mentioned that a Conservative government modernized this legislation in 1988. For the first time, the act stipulated that English and French were to be promoted. That aspect of the act has been neglected, which is why it has become urgent that we modernize the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375012">The situation has become urgent for two reasons. First, unfortunately, we are seeing a decline in French in Quebec and all our communities. Without wanting to be too negative, the number of people who use French in communities across Canada dropped dramatically between 2006 and 2016. French is seriously declining across the country. We have seen it recently in Quebec, particularly in Montreal. We are talking about an even more rapid decline in French there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375013">For example, demographer Marc Termote told us that we are in a downward spiral, a vicious circle of sorts, where English is thriving and French is declining. Our country's francophone foundation needs some repairs, a helping hand. This expert even said that there has been a drop in the number of people who speak French at home.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6375014">We are facing many challenges when it comes to the language, whether it is the spoken language, language of work, language of instruction or language of signage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375015">I see some colleagues who are on the Standing Committee on Official Languages taking part in the debate this evening. We agreed to address this. This evening we are having a take-note debate that I would say is just scratching the surface. There is a lot of work to be done. At the same time, the urgent need to take action is emerging. Groups and minorities across the country are calling for this. For instance, the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne, the FCFA, is telling us to do something. We are in a minority government situation. The president of the FCFA, Mr. Johnson, said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375016">We fear that if the government does not introduce a bill by the end of 2020, the two chambers of Parliament will not have enough time to adopt the changes that our communities have wanted for decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375017">It is therefore important and urgent to take action, especially because work has been done by the Standing Committee on Official Languages and the FCFA. Recommendations have been made, and the work is done. This country is ripe for new legislation. We still have a few weeks ahead of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375018">I have been listening to the presentations given by our government colleagues. They are saying that they want to take action and that they have plans. Now is the time to act, to make sure the laws are put in place. We are asking the government to act and to introduce its bill to modernize the Official Languages Act today, for two reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375019">First, all communities have been calling for it for decades, as Mr. Johnson said. It is a commitment, a will and a promise made by the party. It is also because several demographers, such as Frédéric Lacroix, are telling us that the situation is “catastrophic”. This is the reason for tonight's debate. It is therefore time to take action, and there is a real need to act. The goal is really to take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375020">My colleague from Victoriaville brought forward some concrete proposals to give the act some teeth. It is worth noting that the Official Languages Act is a quasi-constitutional law, which gives it primacy. That is why it is important that this act transcend the various departments and that it remain very close to the Treasury Board, in order to influence the entire federal bureaucracy, but also to explore new fields and become a partner in supporting the vitality of the French language in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375021">In any case, it has been a nice evening, and this is a constructive debate. It is interesting to hear the contribution and personal journey of each member in the House. My own family name is of Irish origin. This is proof that Quebec has the ability to integrate linguistic communities. My father married a Breton woman, and I am very proud of my fluency in French. I would say that I speak French quite a bit better than English.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375022">I will close with that, and I look forward to my colleagues' questions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375054">First of all, I want to note that Marc-André Bédard has passed away. He was a great Quebecker who did a lot to modernize Quebec and who was, according to all those who were fortunate to meet him, a very gentle man who was very charismatic and intelligent. I offer my sincere condolences to his family, in particular to his son Eric, who I worked with at Fasken Martineau and who, when I was 26 years old, gave me my first piece of political advice when embarking on this political adventure. It was a very simple piece of advice. However, it is important to remember it, and easy to forget. He told me never to speak ill of my adversaries. That is very much the philosophy of the entire Bédard family. We should not be surprised because the apple does not fall far from the tree, of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375055">As for the subject at hand this evening, I have a few comments to make in the little time I have available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375056">The first is that one cannot change what one is unaware of, be it because of ignorance or because one refuses to see things as they are. The fact is, when it comes to language, we know one thing with absolute certainty. French is in decline in Quebec. Many Quebeckers perceive this as a feeling they get from time to time, but one look at the numbers turns feeling into knowing, and that knowledge is deeply disturbing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375057">What do the numbers tell us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375058">Between 2001 and 2016, the number of Quebeckers reporting French as their mother tongue fell from 81.4% to 78%. It is the first time in the 150 years that these records have been kept, the first time since 1871, that the percentage of Quebeckers whose first language is French dropped below 80%. According to Statistics Canada, if this trend continues, the percentage of Quebeckers whose mother tongue is French will be somewhere between 69% and 72% by 2036.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375059">The situation is even more dire in Montreal, where the percentage is five points lower than it was 15 years ago. Francophones now account for less than 50% of the population, and this is happening in the suburbs too, in places like Laval and even Longueuil. Demographer Marc Termote did a study for the Office québécois de la langue française in 2011, and such findings recently prompted him to state that things were progressing much faster than he thought just 10 years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375060">This is due in part to the fact that more and more people are speaking English. Unlike people who live in France or Belgium or even Spain or Portugal, people who live in Quebec are not removed from the magnetic attraction of English. They are immersed in its electromagnetic field. They are stuck right to the magnet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375061">It took craftiness, resilience, persistence, intelligence and courage to resist for four centuries and to still have a francophone society in the Americas. More than 100 years ago, Armand La Vergne's determination brought about the first language law in Quebec, and this determination was mirrored by Dr. Laurin and René Lévesque with Bill 101. Much like my former colleague, Stéphane Dion, I think this is a great piece of legislation, which enshrined the French language in law and cemented its place in Quebec, all while respecting the rights of the anglophone minority in Quebec, which was fundamental to the authors. This is just as important now as it was back then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375062">It is in our hands now, and to borrow the words of Antonio Gramsci, I am a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will. I sense that will in Quebec. I sense it here. We heard it in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375063">Frankly, I am more concerned about the indifference I see and feel, especially among people of my generation. I hope with all of my heart that I am wrong, but I think this shows how important this evening's debate is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375064">I believe that we have an individual and collective duty, as Quebeckers, to ensure that the French language is passed on and that it survives. Our language is central to the soul and character of the Quebec people. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375088">I came to Canada in 1980 with my single mother. We settled in the heart of the francophone community in eastern Montreal. I grew up in the age of Bill 101, and I learned French, which I speak today in the House, and my family and children learned it as well.

              <ParaText id="6375096">For the first time, the federal government is recognizing that there is a minority in Canada and North America: the francophone community. I am the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship. Most importantly, I am an immigrant who went through the French integration process and the newcomer classes and who watched her mother make a concerted effort to integrate into her new city. To me, it is obvious that immigration is important and crucial to the future of French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375097">Our government is responsible for ensuring that the newcomers who come to Canada every year without knowing French start to learn French. We do that by transferring significant amounts of money to Quebec to support French integration, under the Canada-Quebec accord, which gives Quebec the exclusive power to select immigrants in several categories and to ensure that considerations such as French are respected and maintained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375098">According to Quebec's 2016 Samson report, more than 43% of those who settle in the Montreal area do not speak French when they arrive in Canada. As for the rest of Quebec, the statistics are a little more encouraging. Between 75% and 89% of newcomers, depending on the immigration class, say they speak French. However, 54% of those in the economic immigration class do not speak French when they arrive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375099">That is why investments in French integration are essential to ensure that all immigrants and newcomers like me, my family and my children can learn French, integrate into the host society, work in French, be taught in French and consume culture in French.</ParaText>

Statistics show beyond a shadow of a doubt that there has been a decline in the use of spoken French at work and at home in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375125">An article published by Le Devoir in 2019 indicated that the number of people who speak French most often at home is dropping by 1%. That may not seem like much, but if we lose 1% every year, then we will lose a lot and francophones will no longer be heard by their communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375126">This decline may seem minor, but it will translate to much bigger losses in the next 20 years. We need to act now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375127">Quebeckers are concerned. According to a Leger Marketing survey, nearly six in 10 Quebeckers feel that the situation has gotten worse in the past decade. The same proportion of people feel that the use of French will continue to decline over the next decade. Sixty-three per cent of respondents said that they were concerned about the situation of French. I repeat: I am very concerned for our future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375128">However, what I find most embarrassing is the Liberal government's inaction. Seriously, I ask myself this question a lot: Where have the Liberal members from Quebec been for the past five years? Back in 2015, this government campaigned on promises about official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375129">I must say that over the past year and in recent days, the Quebec Liberal caucus has shown that it has no respect for or credibility when it comes to the French language. First of all, in the WE Charity scandal, the Liberal government awarded an untendered contract to an organization with no ties to Quebec and no way of communicating with francophone Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375130">In recent weeks, the <Affiliation DbId="253406" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation>, a Quebecker, introduced Bill <Document DbId="10926636" Type="3">C-10</Document> to modernize the Broadcasting Act. There is no provision to ensure that French is protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375131">As if that were not enough, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252671" Type="2">Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> expressed doubts about the decline of French in Montreal, and the Quebec president of the Liberal Party agreed. Without mincing words, and said that Bill 101 is quite simply oppressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375132">We might have thought it was a lapse in judgment or a misinterpretation of what the member for Saint-Laurent said. However, a few minutes after she quit the Standing Committee on Official Languages, the member for Saint-Laurent was at it again. She “liked” a tweet that said that the crisis around the decline of French was exaggerated. Seriously, it is unacceptable. Was she expressing what the Liberal MPs from Quebec are thinking? Maybe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375133">When we add it all up, we can say that we know the current government's real opinion on the decline of French, despite the fine words from the <Affiliation DbId="253381" Type="4">Minister of Official Languages</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation>. The Minister of Official Languages often likes to say in this chamber that our political party has no lessons to give her party. I would just like to take this opportunity to remind her that it was the Conservative Party of Canada, led by the the Hon. Brian Mulroney, that repealed the Official Languages Act in 1988. The Liberals can brag outside the House and say that they were the ones who brought in this legislation in 1969, but again, history shows that it was the Conservatives that had to improve policies brought in by the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6375134">That statement is not unfounded. According to Linda Cardinal, a political scientist and research chair in Canadian francophonie and public policy at the University of Ottawa, “The 1969 legislation had no real might. It conferred primarily political rights, whereas the 1988 legislation had more to do with human rights.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375135">The Conservative Party has always made it a priority to defend the interests of people across the country, and amendments to that act certainly made things better for all francophones across the country. However, the act is in dire need of an overhaul because it is 2020 and the act has not been modernized in over 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375136">In 2017, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages asked parliamentarians to modernize the act, but the government never did more than talk, like the lyrics from that famous song that goes, “Words, words, words”. I do not sing as well as the member for <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>. I do not have that talent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375137">I would add that the government has nothing but words to offer Canadians. When it is time to put plans into action, this government simply cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375138">In June 2018, Mark Power and Darius Bossé, lawyers working in the area of language rights, wrote in an op-ed that the survival of French in Canada requires a thorough revision of the federal Official Languages Act. I could mention several other experts who have publicly criticized the current situation. In spite of everything, it is obvious that there is no linguistic sensitivity on the part of this government. To this day, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252683" Type="2">Ahuntsic-Cartierville</Affiliation> and Minister of Official Languages cannot tell us when she will introduce her legislation to modernize the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375139">When I was preparing this speech, I was surprised to learn that the current <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> in this government voted against the Conservative motion moved in 2006 recognizing the Quebec nation and, by extension, the importance of French in Quebec. Worse still, 15 Liberal members voted against that motion. That is not counting those who did not show up for the vote. Fifteen Liberals voted against that motion, and several others were absent. We can therefore conclude that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252671" Type="2">Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> is not the only one in the Liberal Party of Canada caucus who does not really care about the decline of French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375140">There is a genuine consensus on our side of the House. Our leader publicly announced it a few months ago. He did not play politics like the members opposite. He was clear about the issue and our caucus has been too. We will always respect Quebec's areas of jurisdiction and work with Quebec's elected officials as real partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375141">We agree with the Legault government that Bill 101 should be applied to federally regulated businesses in Quebec. Quebeckers deserve to be represented by members who will stand up for them, who will defend the French language and who are able to say loud and clear without any ambiguity that French is declining in Quebec and Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375142">I would like to close with a famous quote by Albert Camus, which represents the essence of my political commitment and which should inspire the member for Saint-Laurent and the other members of the Liberal Party. He said, “Democracy is not the law of the majority but the protection of the minority”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375143">Liberal members from Quebec did not do their duty and the Minister of Official Languages is not doing anything to resolve the situation, but we will continue to protect and defend our two official languages in Montreal, Quebec and all across Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375170">Maybe we can talk about absurdity this evening because of all these people who are in favour of Bill 101. In 1977, when it was introduced, both the Liberals and the Conservatives were staunchly opposed to it because it was going to create inequalities by giving allophones the right to attend English-language schools. Everybody strongly opposed it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375172">Then there was a discussion about applying Bill 101 to federally regulated companies.

Once in Canada, she was taken with Pierre Trudeau's vision, by the idea of French Power in Ottawa, the Official Languages Act and Canadian biculturalism. This woman who originally had no connection to French chose to enrol her four children in French immersion in Calgary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375182">That experience had a profound impact on my wife, who later went to university to become a social sciences teacher in French immersion. In other words, she studied so she could promote the French language. Her love of French is what brought her to Quebec, where she even worked one summer as a young guide at the National Assembly, showing Quebeckers the splendour of their legislature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375183">In Calgary, not only did my wife learn French, but she also got a taste of Quebec culture. I will never forget when I suggested that we go see Luc de Larochellière at the Francofolies. To my great surprise, she already knew his music, as well as the music of Michel Rivard and Richard Séguin. Her teachers in Calgary were Quebec francophones. They shared their culture with their students. I say all this to provide an example of the power of attraction of the French language and Quebec culture.</ParaText>

When we talk about languages in Canada, we cannot forget the concerns of francophone minority communities outside Quebec. These communities need strong support from the federal government to flourish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375214">In Quebec, francophones form the majority. The provincial government adopted many measures that impose the use of French. The rules around education ensure that most newcomers to Quebec integrate into the francophone community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375221">We make up less than 1% of the provincial civil service, despite representing over 13% of the population. English-speaking Quebeckers also have our legitimate fears. Any discussion must include us too.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6375242">Madam Chair, the issue of French in Montreal is crucial because the fate of French in Quebec is being played out in Montreal. Basically, the fate of French in Canada and North America is being played out in Montreal, because the Montreal metropolitan area is home to almost 50% of Quebec's population and welcomes 90% of newcomers, within a few decimal places. We must therefore act quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375243">I will give some statistics, but it is important to remember that Montreal is responsible for welcoming and integrating immigrants and new citizens into the French community for Quebec as a whole. When it comes to the mother tongue, some people say that it should not be taken into account. I agree that it is not the most important indicator, but the mother tongue accounts for intergenerational transmission to some extent, because we pass on our mother tongue to future generations. When allophones or francophones transfer to English, that becomes the mother tongue of their children. In Montreal, there is no doubt that French is rapidly declining as a mother tongue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375244">Let us look at the language of use, which is a much more meaningful indicator. On the Island of Montreal, between 2001 and 2016, the percentage of people who said French was their language of use dropped from 56.4% to 53.1%, a 3% decrease. For English, over the same period, the percentage rose from 25% to 25.1%, for a 1% increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375245">In the greater Montreal area, between 2001 and 2016, French dropped from 70.7% to 68.4%. In only 15 years, that is a 2.3% decrease. English went from 17.4% to 17%, which is also a decrease, but of 0.4% only.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375246">For Quebec as a whole, use of French decreased from 83.1% to 80.6%, a 2.5% reduction over 15 years. That is enormous. English, meanwhile, increased by 0.2%, from 10.5% to 10.7%. Charles Castonguay said that for the first time in Quebec's history, French was receding as the proportion of anglophones increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375247">Earlier, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252678" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> said that there had been an improvement and that more immigrants were integrating in French. That is partially true because language transfers to French increased from 46% to 54%. However, it is important to understand that 46% of transfers to English, with just over 10% of people who speak English at home is huge, while for 80% of people who speak French at home, only 56% switched to French. That is progress but it is not enough, because to maintain our demographic weight, we need at least 90% of language transfers to be toward French. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375248">Why has there been an increase? It is because the Government of Quebec selected more immigrants who are francophone or who already speak French, so that is not an impact of Bill 101. A disproportionate number of newcomers who become anglicized tend to leave Quebec. That gives the impression that language transfers to French are increasing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375249">When we look at the language vitality indicator, we see that the proportion of people with French as their mother tongue on the Island of Montreal increased by 6% in 2011 through language transfers. In 2016, it was 10% more. For English, in 2001, there were 41% more people who spoke English at home than people who had English as a mother tongue. That number was 45% in 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375250">For the greater Montreal area, French increased by 2% in 2001 because of language transfers and by 6% in 2016. English increased from 24% to 42% because of language transfers. For Quebec as a whole, French increased by 2% in 2001 and by 3% in 2016 because of allophones switching to French. English increased by 26% in 2011 and 32% in 2016 for that same reason.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="10">(2210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6375251">We see that French's power of attraction is not strong enough. A study on language planning around the world showed that to ensure the future of a language, it has to be the official and common language of a given territory. These models are based more on the principle of territoriality and collective rights, as seen in Belgium and Switzerland, countries that have several national languages. In Belgium, on the Flemish side, everything happens in Dutch. That does not stop people from learning three or four other second languages very well, but Dutch is not threatened even though it is a language that is not spoken much around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375252">That is the model that inspired Bill 101. Once Bill 101 was established, there was real progress in French and an increase in language transfer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375253">However, as soon as every Supreme Court ruling started chipping away at Bill 101, and especially when the Constitution was patriated, judges from every federal court in Quebec weakened Bill 101 in almost every application sector. In 1982, the government imposed a Constitution and a Charter of Rights and Freedoms on us that completely undermined the educational part of Bill 101, which was the most important part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375254">Our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252672" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation> was a member of Alliance Québec, a group that fought a real legal guerilla war against Bill 101 and whose fight was subsidized by the federal government. The Official Languages Act is based on a model that invariably leads to the assimilation of minority languages. It is a kind of institutional bilingualism centred on individual rights that produces the same result all over the world, namely the assimilation of minority languages. In spite of that, the situation of francophone and Acadian communities improved because French schools and government services in French used to be forbidden in just about all the provinces. People really needed to mobilize for change to occur, and the Official Languages Act finally came, offering a smattering of services in French. Unfortunately, they are largely insufficient. With every census, we also see an increase in the rate of assimilation and anglicization of francophones outside Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375255">Certain budgets are associated with the Official Languages Act. That is what I was talking about earlier. Some $80 million a year is earmarked exclusively for anglophone pressure groups, groups like the Quebec Community Network, which appeared before the Standing Committee on Official Languages not long ago. Its representatives said that the education measures were a violation of civil rights, despite the fact that this is how it is done around the world. Go to the United States and ask for French public schools. It is not going to happen. In the rest of Canada, many francophones do not have access to French-language schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375256">One of the speakers talked about Frédéric Lacroix's book entitled <I>Pourquoi la loi 101 est un échec</I>, or “why Bill 101 is a failure”. The author concludes that the situation is catastrophic in Montreal because the worse it gets, the more language transfers to English increase. He talks about the concept of institutional completeness, which means that the bigger a linguistic group's network of institutions, the more pull its language exerts. We know that Montreal was the focal point of English Canadians' economic dominance for a long time. The Laurendeau-Dunton commission revealed that, of the 14 linguistic groups in Quebec in 1961, francophones ranked 12th for average income. Their average income was 51% of that of anglophones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375257">We have seen some progress with Bill 101, but there is still work to do because francophones' average income is still lower than anglophones'. We can see it, and it is very strange.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375258">My regards to those opposition colleagues who are fellow members of the Standing Committee on Official Languages. We had to push very hard, but we finally passed a unanimous motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375259">For the first time in 51 years, a study will be conducted on the French situation, the effects of the federal language policy and Bill 101. These really are factors that run contrary to one another. On top of that, this $80 million is also being used to promote institutional bilingualism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375260">On the one hand, officials in Montreal are working to ensure that newcomers are integrated into the francophone community. It is normal for newcomers to want to head towards the majority, so they have a natural propensity to move towards the English side. Bill 101 sends a message that French is the common language and the language of work, in order to encourage these people to integrate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375261">On the other hand, the federal government funds the promotion of English in Quebec and tells these newcomers that French is not necessarily the official language that must be adopted and that they have the right to have services in the language of their choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6375262">In closing, I think that what is happening right now is very important. The fact that the federal government has recognized the decline of French sets a precedent, but it will take concrete action and much stronger measures than the simple knowledge of French as a prerequisite for citizenship or applying the law to institutions under federal jurisdiction. Otherwise, the government will simply demonstrate once again to Quebeckers that the only way to ensure the future of the French language is through Quebec's independence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375268">The federal government is constantly pushing for the services to be in English. People tell themselves that they are in Canada, where the majority speaks English, and they believe that they have the choice to be served in French or in English. There is no doubt that those who are more drawn to English tend to choose that language and we only manage to attract people who are already francophone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6375299">Madam Chair, absolutely. As we know, the Official Languages Act was intended to strengthen English in Quebec and French outside Quebec. It was not enough, but at least some funding was allocated to that end. All the funding to promote institutional bilingualism, when Bill 101 was being established—not against individual bilingualism, but against institutional bilingualism—undermines the application of Bill 101. Frédéric Lacroix spoke of the federal government's undermining of Bill 101. If the government will not recognize this, if it will not recognize that the very principle of the Official Languages Act goes against Bill 101, we will not get very far.</ParaText>
