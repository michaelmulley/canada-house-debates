            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6272545">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in the House. I want to start by recognizing that the House is located on the traditional lands of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272546">Today I rise to present our government's plan for banning the destructive, harmful and deadly practice of conversion therapy.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272547">There should be no place for the destructive, harmful and deadly practice of conversion therapy in Canada. When we ask a young person what they want be when they grow up, they answer an occupation. We do not ask about who they want to be or who they think they might be. Imagine a young person trying to come to terms with their identity, wondering what others will think and having questions about what makes them happy, what makes them feel like themselves and what they see when they look in the mirror.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272548">If they are lucky, some young people may have these conversations with their parents. Some will turn to their friends, to religion or to scripture. Many may seek out help from those who they believe are professionals with credentials and therefore must know best. The answers to these questions help shape a future; they help shape a life. Imagine individuals at their most vulnerable putting all their trust in these people for help. While the pandemic has made us all feel vulnerable at times, imagine living that way every day and carrying that weight. Telling someone they are not who they think we are or that who they are is wrong, abnormal or unnatural has devastating consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272549">The limited Canadian studies we have on this practice confirm that this so-called therapy is happening right here in Canada. It is estimated that over 20,000 LGBTQ2 Canadians have been exposed, and 11% of trans individuals in Canada are survivors. We are indebted to survivors and advocates for their strength in speaking out and shining light on this dark practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272550">It is our duty to do everything we can to make a better future for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272551">I hope all members of the House agree with this viewpoint.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272552">That is why within a week of coming back to Parliament we have reintroduced the bill, <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">an act to amend the Criminal Code (conversion therapy)</Document>, to abolish conversion therapy in Canada. On this side of the House we focus on advancing and protecting LGBTQ2 rights and addressing all forms of discrimination, including hetero-cis–normativity and systemic racism. Under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we believe that with this legislation we are building a society where one accepts people for who they are. We are stating to all people in Canada that it is okay, and they can follow their heart, their faith and be true to themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272553">On this side of the House, we believe that acceptance and diversity are absolute. There are those who refuse to accept that sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression have been enshrined into Canadian law as part of the Canadian Human Rights Act. It is unfortunate that in 2020 we continue to have to have this debate. LGBTQ2 rights are human rights, full stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272554">Together, we can help to create a country where everyone is free to be who they are. LGBTQ2 people are valued members of Canadian society, and we must ensure that Canada is a country where everyone, regardless of their gender expression, gender identity or sexual orientation, can lead a happy and authentic life and be loved.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272555">Mr. Speaker, service in the Canadian Armed Forces is a commitment to defending our country, its institutions and the rights enjoyed by our citizens. My service in the military taught me many lessons, but the importance of respecting the rights of my fellow citizens was paramount.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272556">I completed my military service and worked in the private sector for a decade before becoming a member of Parliament. I have always had deep respect for the rights of Canadians. My record speaks for itself: I have always voted in favour of LGBTQ community.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272557">In my first four months as a member of Parliament, my vote was one of a handful of Conservative votes that helped an NDP bill on gender identity to pass. I stood and was counted for rights that day. As a parliamentarian, I am here to secure the rights of every Canadian, including those in the LGBTQ community, and to build an inclusive and prosperous country for all. Now, as leader of the Conservative Party, I pledge to continue this work. I will also hold the Liberal government to account when it falls short and when it prefers to contrast its virtue in a way meant to castigate others.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272558">Once again, let me be crystal clear: Conversion therapy is wrong. In my view, it should be banned.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272559">This is particularly the case when it could be threatened against someone against their will, or when it is used to denigrate or demean someone for who they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272560">Sadly, the Liberals are once again playing politics. Instead of working hard to get things right and make life better for Canadians, they seem intent on scoring political points. Why do members think this bill is here on day two for me as a new leader in the House? Better yet, why do they think the Liberals have reintroduced the exact same bill they did last year, having totally ignored the well-known drafting failures of their first bill? They did this not because they want to get it right for the LGBTQ community. They did this because they want to force the Conservatives to seek amendments or possibly even vote against this bill.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272561">As usual, the Liberals are playing petty politics in an attempt to scare Canadians. They want to divide us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272562">However, I know that Canadians are smarter than the Liberals think they are, and I know that the LGBTQ community sees through this too. I therefore want to use my time to talk for a moment to those in the LGBTQ community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272563">Some of them grew up in a home that did not understand or support them. Many of them faced persecution at school, at work, out in public at a restaurant, on a date, riding the subway, living life. For too many LGBTQ Canadians, that persecution may have even involved the threat or use of conversion therapy. To be forced to change who they are is not okay. That is something I hope no Canadian ever endures again, and if that is the intent of this bill, it needs to be clearly written that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272564"> In fact, clarity is one of the goals of legislative drafting, but the Liberals know that clarity and sincerity do not always make for good wedge politics in the age of Twitter. The Liberals know that if the bill is more clearly drafted they might lose the gotcha effect, which is becoming far too common in the politics we see to the south of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272565">The Liberals know that by ignoring the thoughtful advice they already received from parents, teachers and faith leaders, they create a situation that allows for people who ask a simple question about this bill to be shamed into silence or cancelled on social media in the age of cancel culture. How is this fostering inclusion? In fact, many Liberal operatives are likely on social media right now claiming I am being divisive because I would prefer that we get this bill right and not work to divide Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272566">The Liberal government knows that most Canadians do not want to see conversion therapy continue, but it also knows that most Canadians do not want conversations between a parent and a child or a religious leader and a young person to be criminalized either.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272567">I know that my LGBTQ+ friends want everyone to be treated with dignity and respect.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272568">They want vulnerable members of their community to be protected, and they want people who try to use conversion therapy to denigrate others to be prevented from doing that. I know they do not want to criminalize the conversations of others, because a community that has been unfairly persecuted for generations does not want to start unfairly persecuting others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272569"> People need to be free to talk openly to people they trust in their families or communities. That could be about coming out. That could be about their orientation or their gender identity. It could also be about their own faith or their own personal life journey. They should feel free to talk to others without the fear of a public prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272570">Kids need more support from adults, not less. In an age when young people are swiping and texting more than talking and connecting, we should not be criminalizing talking. Some very simple amendments could fix this, if this bill is truly more than a political wedge. Conversion therapy should be banned to protect young people coming out as LGBTQ.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272571"> I repeat: Conversion therapy should be banned to protect young people who identify as LGBTQ+. I want everyone to feel accepted in our society.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272572">Let us do this in the right way and make sure their support networks are not jeopardized in the process. We will be seeking reasonable amendments to try to get to yes on this. I challenge the government to be reasonable as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272573">LGBTQ Canadians deserve a bill that can ban conversion therapy and remind Canadians that the rights of their fellow citizens are important to defend. They also deserve respect and honesty from their elected officials. I hope they see that from me they can always count on honesty and commitment to their rights.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Ms. Andréanne Larouche (Shefford, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6272574">Mr. Speaker, the government has finally decided to not only ban but actually criminalize the practice of conversion therapy. According to several witnesses, some of these practices are more like torture than therapy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272575">I will be very blunt. This practice, promoted and carried out primarily by religious groups, is based on the idea that homosexuality is wrong. According to such groups, it is more than just disturbing; it is wrong to the point that they think these people are evil and are going to hell. I am not the only one who disagrees with such groups, since this practice has been largely discredited by Quebec and Canadian psychologists and specialists in human sexuality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272576">Homophobia exists; expressions of it can be seen practically every day. It is unacceptable that it has been institutionalized like this by religious groups. It is one thing to feel uncomfortable or to not understand; it is quite another thing to subject human beings to goodness knows what kind of therapeutic process to become someone they are not. We have many historical examples of this, but this is another matter that merits its own debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272577">These therapies perpetuate myths that should no longer exist in 2020. The WHO declared as far back as 2012 that these practices have never turned exclusively homosexual people heterosexual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272578">The media recently reported on the case of a boy who underwent conversion therapy. To read his story, I do not understand how anyone could inflict such anxiety and deep self-hatred on their own child. I am trying not to judge. I refuse to believe that the family of this beautiful boy did not have good intentions. Motivated by religion and an intense desire not to disappoint his loved ones or his God, he paid out of his own pocket for therapy to make him normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272579">The words he used to describe the process are quite apt, describing conversion therapy as social support for self-rejection. That is painfully accurate. Unfortunately, this story echoes that of many children and adolescents who want their parents to be proud of them and to love them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272580">It is for young men like this that I commend and thank the government for introducing legislation. The government can obviously count on my support and that of all my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272581">Many countries have led the way in criminalizing conversion therapy. Quebec has also committed to it. The former British Prime Minister described this therapy as abhorrent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272582"> The abhorrent thing is that, in most cases, these people turned away from religion, left their families and even started a new life somewhere else. They went through all that before finally deciding to accept themselves and live in a way that is true to themselves. I simply cannot imagine the time and courage needed to decide to stand up to all that pressure and say, “No, this is not working. That is not me.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272583">We all know that, when we are young, we are very dependent on our family and friends and we care a lot about what they think of us. We are not always able to make our own choices, to decide to find ourselves or to make peace with ourselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272584">Many of us, who did not have to ask ourselves all of these questions, sometimes have a hard time finding inner peace. I cannot even imagine what it must be like for these people. Many of them have spent decades trying to fight against themselves, against their true nature and against what they are, wondering why they were born like that, why this had to happen to them or why they are unable to change. They end up hating themselves. They come to hate who they are and those they love. It is terrible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272585">People who have undergone this type of therapy are survivors. Now that conversion therapy is illegal, it sends a clear, if somewhat minor, political and social message. My wish for all members of the LGBTQ+ community is to not only survive, but also to live in a way that is true to who they are, how they feel and who they love.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253064" Type="2">Mr. Randall Garrison (Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6272586">Mr. Speaker, this morning I want to start by congratulating the government on the prompt reintroduction of this bill to ban conversion therapy in Canada, despite some members being in their early days in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272587">At this ungodly hour in British Columbia, I want to stick to three simple points. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272588">First, this is very welcome legislation. No one in the SOGIE community needs fixing because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. In fact, attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity is impossible, and the attempts themselves do great harm to those fearing or already suffering from rejection by family, friends and their community. Again, this is welcome legislation, and I am glad that the Liberals in this Parliament have changed their position to support the ban on conversion therapy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272589">The topic was first brought before Parliament by Sheri Benson, former NDP member for Saskatoon West, with an e-petition more than two years ago that received more than 18,000 signatures. The government's response at that time was that this simply was not a matter for federal jurisdiction, so I was glad to see the Liberals change their position during the last federal campaign, and I was glad to see Bill <Document DbId="10686845" Type="3">C-8</Document> introduced on March 20, which I know to all of us seems an eon ago. Now COVID, combined with prorogation, has put us back to square one on this bill today. When it comes to the practice of conversion therapy, which attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity through counselling or aversion therapy and does great harm to those subjected to it, we need protection from harmful attempts to get us to deny who we are. The practice must end. Again, no one in the SOGIE community needs fixing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272590">Second, on all issues of importance to the SOGIE community, progress has been achieved as the result of brave advocates from our community stepping forward. In terms of protecting our rights, nothing has ever been given to my community without a struggle. I want to give a particular note of thanks to conversion therapy survivors who have stepped forward to tell their stories, two of whom have had a particular impact on me in terms of focusing my attention on this issue. They are Matt Ashcroft and Erika Muse. Just a couple of days ago, three conversion therapy survivors organized an online summit entitled End Conversion Therapy. I want to thank the co-founders of CT Survivors again for their important work: Rocky Tishma, Michael Ferguson and Matt Ashcroft. The conference focused on preventing anyone else from having to suffer the harm of conversion therapy by discussing how to defend, strengthen and heal our communities. Participants heard first-hand accounts of the damage that conversion therapy does, from people who had lived it, and heard how conversion therapy survivors are now working to support each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272591">Third, I want to emphasize again that the NDP will support the bill before us, but I have said all along that we need to listen carefully to the SOGIE community, and in particular to conversion therapy survivors, as we work to strengthen the bill at committee. The Liberals have suggested a legal strategy that falls short of the real demand of survivors and the SOGIE community: a complete ban on conversion therapy in Canada. There is also concern that the ban does not capture the full range of conversion therapy practices and that there needs to be more attention to those practices directed at the transgender and non-binary community. Thousands of Canadians have been subjected to the harmful practice of conversion therapy, and it is something that is still with us. Studies have shown that, even more than the minister suggested, nearly 50% of trans and non-binary Canadians have been subjected to some form of conversion therapy, instead of being affirmed and celebrated for who they are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272592">It is past time to ban this practice in Canada, but as we do so, we must also remember that it is necessary to strengthen the capacity of the SOGIE community to work with survivors to repair as much of that harm as possible. I will be watching to make sure that the federal government makes a significant contribution to that effort. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272593">I look forward to working with the government to make sure that we get both parts of this job done soon.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272596">In Canada, our constitution and our laws protect people from discrimination based on grounds such as sex, religion, disability, sexual orientation and sexual identity. Through the years, the scope of these protections must evolve. Looking through the historical lens, we can be proud of when the former prime minister, the Right. Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, affirmed that what is done in private between adults does not concern the Criminal Code, and when marriage between two partners of the same gender became legal in 2005. Through this evolution in our society, we witnessed the power of the rising tide of freedom and love, but to say that these rights were recognized without any suffering would be to blind ourselves to the constant fight for justice that achieving equality requires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272597">Even with our laws and protections providing a safe haven for many, when compared to other nations, the reason we are here today is evidence that for many Canadians, being who they are is still not a safe option. The cruel practice of conversion therapy is a practice aimed to change, by employing various approaches, an individual's sexual orientation to heterosexual, or their gender identity to cisgender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272598">The World Health Organization issued a statement almost a decade ago, saying that this type of therapy poses a severe threat to the health and human rights of the affected person. The Canadian Psychological Association warned in 2015 of the numerous impacts on the health of an individual, from depression and anxiety to self-harms and suicide. It is more than time that we act and criminalize this inhumane practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272599">I want to strongly affirm my support to the proposition to criminalize conversion therapy, completely and utterly. We must protect Canadians from the harm of this practice and not leave any stone unturned to ensure a future where no one will have to undergo such pain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272600">We must also understand that for many, the realization of their true identity only comes once they have the opportunity to experience and explore life. Criminalizing the practice for minors is essential, although we must go further to ban the practice for everyone and not legitimize any loophole. Assuming that people, even if they are not a minor person, will not hope to try to please family members who offer their love only on the condition that the person goes through conversion therapy ignores the human need to receive parental and family support, freedom and affection. Many adults would accept to undergo the procedure in the hope of erasing who they are, to finally receive the love that they need. That is why allowing the therapy to simply exist in any shape or form is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272601">Beyond the criminalization of conversion therapy, we need to invest in services that support people. Discovering oneself in an accepting family environment can still come with challenges for many people. Everyone should have access to the affirming and caring support that they need to thrive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272602"> Educators and health care providers must receive training to ensure that they are providing the best support to the people who they are supposed to help. That means learning about gender identity, respecting pronouns and not further fostering an environment that assumes heterosexuality as the norm. That means supporting, financially, community organizations and health care providers, such as Clinic 554, whose work has had life-saving impacts for many patients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272603">Canada must continue to stand up for the protection and promotion of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, two-spirit and intersex people globally. All of us here in this chamber must ensure that we pass legislation that effectively protects that community, but also support any measure that would fund services and ensure that anyone who needs support can easily access it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272604">To the parents, teachers and coaches out there, many of our children are hiding their truest selves from us because they are still afraid that they will not be loved for who they are. Join me in celebrating this bill for what it is: a chance to explain to all our children that they are worthy of love just as they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272605">I would like to give a shout-out as well to journalists, who have done the important work of bringing many of these voices forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272606">I am eager to see the bill passed in the House.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6272620">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to put my thoughts on the record today with respect to the 2020 Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272621">There was a lot of hype generated from the Liberal benches for the speech, particularly because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament with the excuse that his government needed six weeks off from parliamentary duties to formulate it, but in reality, there was not a whole lot new in this throne speech. It was mostly recycled Liberal promises from the past 30 years. For example, if we take child care and pharmacare, I was but a very small child in the 1990s when the Liberals first announced they were going to do this. That was 30 years ago, so from that perspective the Liberals really have no credibility on any of the priorities they have promised in the throne speech. I am certain many Canadians would agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272622">Perhaps the six-week prorogation in the middle of the worst health and economic crisis in a century was really to avoid the billion-dollar WE scandal, the resignation of the former finance minister or possibly the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s third ethics violation investigation, or maybe it was a pre-election strategy to announce massive spending in order to court votes for the next election. Regardless of the reason, the Liberal government had the responsibility to introduce a plan for Canadians to get them back to work safely and failed to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272623">Shamefully, the throne speech failed to even mention Manitoba, and it was nearly an hour long, which really shows the priorities of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> with respect to the concerns of Manitobans. There were so many opportunities for the Liberals to support Manitoba, in particular, our critical infrastructure needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272624">I have personally called on the <Affiliation DbId="253366" Type="4">Minister of Infrastructure</Affiliation> to support the partnership between the Province of Manitoba and the City of Winnipeg and approve the $321 million in federal funds required for the north end wastewater treatment plant upgrade project in my riding. Manitoba needs this project in order to support the health of Lake Winnipeg, which as all Manitobans know has been severely impacted by algae blooms due to too much phosphorous. It is a green infrastructure project, a no-brainer for the government, and I have asked and urged it to please approve this funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272625">Additionally, some of the hardest-hit people in my riding have been small business owners who employ thousands of Manitobans, and these jobs are in jeopardy. Many of these businesses were not eligible for any support from the Liberal government. There are still issues with small business owners qualifying for the CEBA loan, where business owners used personal banking accounts rather than business banking accounts and as a result were not eligible. The Liberals promised this change months ago to much fanfare and it has yet to be delivered. Many other businesses in my riding were not able to access the commercial rent assistance program, which has been widely regarded as a dismal failure, despite the desperate need for its success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272626">One area in which Canada cannot afford to be anything less than successful is with rapid testing. Possibly one of the most frustrating things about this throne speech is the failure of the Liberal government to prioritize the desperate need for rapid testing in this country. It is not as if the Liberals did not know it was a priority. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself mentioned it back in March, six to seven months ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272627">If we fast-forward to today, my constituents are sitting in long car lineups on Main Street in Winnipeg because of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s lack of leadership on this and the apparent inability of the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> to pick up the phone and call our trusted allies in Germany, the U.K., Japan and many others, to ask how they brought about these rapid tests for their citizens months ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272628">Rapid at-home testing would be a game-changer for Canadians, especially in parts of Canada that are entering a second shutdown, like in Manitoba where we are no longer allowed to gather in groups larger than 10 people, even if we are outside, which has been really tough for Manitobans. Rapid testing would allow Manitobans to safely visit their elderly parents in care homes or send their kids to school with the all-too-common runny nose, and our front-line workers could feel assured that their dry cough is not a death sentence to those around them. Importantly, for the immigration file, rapid testing could give Canadians confidence that families separated due to the Liberals' border closures could safely reunite. Safety is key. The Liberal delay on rapid and at-home testing is unacceptable. Canadians deserve far better from the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272629">The stakes have never been higher. Our economy and the finances of our country are facing desperate circumstances. We have spent $380 billion of deficit so far in this pandemic, which as we have learned from our shadow minister of finance would be roughly $40,000 per family of four. We are only seven months into this pandemic since the first lockdown, so imagine where we are going to be in a year at this spending rate. More than that, our national debt has reach over $1.5 trillion under the Liberal government’s watch. I do not even understand how much money that is because it is so gargantuan. While the Liberals continue to tell Canadians that it is all fine because interest rates are low, Canadians have the right to know that there is no guarantee interest rates will remain low. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272630">The Liberals seem to have no intention of ever balancing the budget, and conceivably, Canadians alive today may never see another balanced federal budget if these Liberals remain in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272631">Conservatives recognize that it was the government that forced Canadians to stay home and businesses to shut down, stopping their ability to earn an income, and so it was the government’s responsibility to compensate for them for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272632">However, now Canada has the highest unemployment rate in the G7, with 10% of our working population unemployed, and many more working at a reduced capacity. In fact, compared to our G7 allies, we have spent the most on the pandemic recovery, yet we have the worst economic outcomes. How is that possible? It is far from over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272633">Our beloved neighbourhood businesses are at risk. For example, we know that three out of five of our restaurants may close permanently. It really is terribly sad to think about what Canadians are going through during this very difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272634">The Liberal government needs to be doing a far better job on many things, and one of those things is immigration. I am honoured to serve as the shadow minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship. I sincerely thank our leader for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility on behalf of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272635">As I peel back the layers of this $4-billion department, I am finding that the Liberals have severely mismanaged many areas of immigration, particularly family reunification. COVID-19 is the greatest challenge Canada has faced in 100 years, yet the Liberals have asked some Canadians including and Canadian children to navigate this challenge alone, without the support of a spouse, a parent or a close sibling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272636">Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer has told Canadians that the virus may be with us until 2022. What message does the <Affiliation DbId="253396" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> have for families currently separated in response to this warning? The status quo has been cold-hearted and unsustainable. The emotional well-being and financial realities of separated families must be addressed immediately by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272637">Conservatives believe in a non-partisan, welcoming and well-managed immigration system for Canada based on a fair, transparent and efficient process that earns the respect of all of Canadians. We firmly believe in compassionate measures to assist in family reunification and to uphold Canada’s humanitarian tradition as a safe haven for refugees. I will work diligently to hold the Liberals to this standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272638">Canadians expect Conservatives to face this unprecedented challenge head on and to put forward a robust and inspiring vision for the future of this country that ensures national unity, prosperity and regaining respect on the world stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272639">We understand the suffering of working people, because we are working people, and we will champion their ambition to be successful and support their families in a free society. Canadians deserve a government that will lead them through the difficulties we face.

              <ParaText id="6272646">I am a little dismayed to see the government members playing a kind of partisan politics. They claim that the opposition's comments are always partisan, yet this government shut down the House for five weeks and then forced us to pass legislation at breakneck speed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272647">I just want everyone to understand what happened this week when we were forced to vote so quickly. Based on the total spending set out in these bills, we were voting on more than $200 million per minute. That is a mind-boggling figure, considering the agricultural industry as a whole got a paltry $252 million during the entire pandemic. This is so wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272648">I would like to hear what my colleague thinks about this, and especially about the compensation for supply-managed sectors that was mentioned in the throne speech.

              <ParaText id="6272657">In my riding, female-owned businesses are suffering under the lack of support from the Liberal government, and, in particular, the commercial rent assistance program. I doubt very much that this program was put through the government's GBA+ analysis because, if it had, we may have seen that the difficulties of small business owners to approach their landlord to plead and negotiate for this commercial rent assistance is a problem for many businesses. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272660">I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to the recent Speech from the Throne. As Her Excellency the Governor General said, each of us, as parliamentarians, has a duty to work within the constraints of these challenging times.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6272661">The members of this House are not only tasked with addressing a once-in-a-century health crisis, but also a devastating climate crisis, long-standing social and economic inequalities, and unrest around the globe. COVID-19 has highlighted existing inequalities in our society and the urgent need for these to be addressed. Although the past few months have shocked our systems, this is not the first time we have been called to address a quickly changing world amid social and economic unrest and a devastating global health crisis, but we have to go back 100 years to find anything quite like what we are dealing with today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272662">Much has changed in Canada since the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and 1919 swept over a nation already strained by the unprecedented impacts of one of the first truly global wars. This House was a very different place then. It would be another two years before Agnes Macphail would become the first woman elected to the federal Parliament. In that same year, Canadian women were given the right to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272663"> During this Women's History Month, it is important to remind ourselves of these facts. The idea that it was important for the government to step up and help its citizens in times of difficulty, and support them when they needed it, was new and radical at the time, but it would not remain so. After losing 60,000 Canadians in the First World War, we were to lose another 50,000 while politicians in the House said public health was not their concern but that of the provinces, or the municipalities, or hospitals and charities, or the individual. Canadians were not prepared to accept such heartless indifference from their elected officials and were not going to take it. They demanded change, as they would again and again during times of crisis. Our predecessors in the House of Commons listened. It is our turn to listen now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272664">We are the delegates of the people and, as Agnes Macphail said, “The first thing to be considered by...the delegates of the people...is: what do the people want?” I quote the words of the first woman elected to this House because the people want gender equality; the people want us to support the most vulnerable in our society, including seniors and persons with disabilities; the people want social and economic justice; the people want us to fight climate change and leave a healthier planet for our children; the people want us to fight discrimination and bigotry; and, the people need support from their federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272665">Although COVID-19 has negatively impacted Canadians of all races and genders, it is women who have been hardest hit. At the height of the pandemic, 62% of job losses impacted women. Many had to make the difficult choice between their jobs and their children, leading to what has been called a “she-cession”. Over the past five years, our government has made historic investments to promote gender equality. We cannot afford to lose the ground we have gained, and we must do more. In building back better, our government plans to create an action plan for women in the economy, guided by experts whose diverse voices will help power a whole-of-government approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272666"> I am pleased to see the government's commitment to make a significant long-term investment to create a Canada-wide early learning and child care system. According to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce's she-covery project report, by supporting women's participation in the workforce, by 2026, Canada could add up to $150 billion to our annual GDP. To achieve this, we must offer Canadian families both day care and before- and after-school programs. We are talking about helping more families, helping more women join the workforce and be treated equally to men. I am surprised that I have to say it in 2020, but women are still fighting and we cannot give up now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272667">Supreme Court of Canada Justice Rosalie Abella recently wrote an opinion piece on the death of her friend, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

              <ParaText id="6272669">I was very happy to discuss the throne speech with disability advocates like Professor Jeff Preston at King's College in London. Our intent to introduce a new Canada disability benefit along the lines of the guaranteed income supplement as well as reforming the eligibility process for Canadians with disabilities is being well received by the disability community. However, Jeff is worried about what will happen after a vaccine is found and people with disabilities try to get back into the workforce. Our government recognizes this problem and has committed to a robust employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272670">While some of us are getting tired of doing business by Zoom, many people with disabilities see this as a lifeline. We must harness this new way of doing business to help everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272671">Over the last six months, we heard about many long-term care facilities that had been ravaged by COVID-19. The tragic scenes that we have watched unfold across Canada these past few months should never have happened. Of all of Canada's deaths related to COVID-19, a staggering 85% of them occurred in long-term care homes. Now with the second wave, we have to do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272672">On this National Seniors Day, Canadians have demanded we do more. This is why we will work with our partners in the provinces and territories to implement national standards for long-term care homes, so all Canadian seniors can live securely and with peace of mind. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said recently that he remained unapologetic for doing everything we could to support our seniors, that they deserved nothing less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272673">While COVID-19 has been raging around the world, fires on the west coast, so massive the suffocating smoke has reached Ontario, remind us of another insidious threat that imperils our world, climate change. Canadians are joining people around the world who are saying we must act and we must act quickly. We cannot put aside our plans for a cleaner environment because we are fighting a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272674">I wish this was not a political issue, but regrettably some of my colleagues have turned it into one. They ignore the economic opportunity that creating a greener, more sustainable economy can provide Canadians, including those in the natural resource sector. They ignore the long-term savings for individuals, businesses and governments in transitioning to a net-zero economy. We have not. Our government will utilize the expertise and know-how of the energy sector and the natural resource sector to reach net zero. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272675">A key part of this plan will be continuing to support innovation and help businesses grow and grow green. As the parliamentary secretary for economic development for southern Ontario, I spent the last number of months speaking to mayors, chambers of commerce and business leaders across sectors. They were all very supportive of the government's quick action to support the many businesses that had been adversely affected by COVID. Whether it was the Canada emergency wage subsidy or the Canada emergency response benefit, they knew we had the best interest of workers and businesses in mind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272676">Just before the throne speech, I spoke with the manager of the London International Airport. He said that they were really hoping CEWS would be extended so they could keep staff on the payroll and be ready when travellers came back, and they will come back. He of course was very happy to hear that our government was proposing the emergency wage subsidy be continued until the summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272677">Other businesses were kept afloat during COVID-19 because we offered close to $1 billion nationally with the regional relief and recovery fund, or RRRF, through our economic development agencies. Many of these businesses would not have survived even six months without this support, particularly in rural and remote communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272678">Countless Canadians are in sectors like the performing arts and the hospitality or tourism whose livelihoods have been especially hard hit. That is why Destination Canada is investing $30 million to support the recovery of communities. We know the hotel industry is the backbone of tourism in our country and we are working tirelessly to help affected workers and entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272679">I look forward to supporting even more initiatives. I hope my colleagues of all parties will work with us constructively as we rise to meet the challenges we face today. We are privileged to meet in this chamber. Canadians are calling upon us to meet the times we face. It is our duty to meet them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272698">I am proud of the great solidarity and resilience that the people of Châteauguay—Lacolle have demonstrated during this difficult time. From the beginning of the lockdown, many volunteers and community groups stepped up to help those who were most affected by the health crisis. Terrific organizations such as Sourire sans Fin in Saint-Rémi and the Centre d'action bénévole du grand Châteauguay provided services, such as much needed food to local families, and the coordination of personal outreach calls to seniors confined to their homes. I was very pleased to see our government sent supplemental funds out to these and other groups in our regions that were providing emergency relief.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272705">The first foundation is to fight COVID-19 and save lives by doing everything in our power to protect Canadians, especially the most vulnerable. We need to work together to ensure the health and safety of our citizens and to beat this virus. We will do so by guaranteeing Canadians that they can be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is ready. We will also support our provincial partners and ensure that we have adequate supplies of protective equipment and testing materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272706"> The second foundation of our plan is supporting people and businesses through this crisis as long as it lasts, whatever it takes. Contrary to what some say, this is not the time for austerity. The strength of our actions now will determine the quality of the world we will leave our children and grandchildren. The best thing we can do is to support Canadians during this health crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272707">Why did our government take extraordinary, but necessary, measures during the first wave of the pandemic? Canadians should not have to choose between their health and their job, just like Canadians should not have to take on debt that their government can better shoulder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272708">This will be our guiding principle from here on out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272709">I thank members from all parties for their unanimous support of the measures in Bill <Document DbId="10867435" Type="3">C-4</Document>, which passed in the House the other night. These important measures, including a more flexible EI program, paid sick leave and a caregiver benefit, will allow us to continue helping Canadians and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272710">By extending the Canada emergency wage subsidy and the Canada emergency business account, we will help companies stay in business, create jobs, support women in the economy and ensure our financial sustainability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272711">The third foundation in our government's plan is to build back better to create a stronger, more resilient Canada. One thing we have seen is that this pandemic has laid bare unacceptable inequalities in our society. We need to do something and bridge the gaps in our social systems, invest in health care and strengthen our workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272712">Today is the International Day of Older Persons, and I want to say that our government remains committed to increasing old age security once a senior turns 75 and to boosting the Canada pension plan survivor’s benefit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272713">The fourth pillar of the plan is standing up for our Canadian identity and values. Canadians take care of one another, as we have seen from coast to coast to coast in recent months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272714">I am proud of the solidarity the people of Châteauguay—Lacolle have demonstrated. For example, a group of girls organized a Black Lives Matter rally with help from our Kahnawake Mohawk neighbours. Since then, a number of initiatives have sprung up in my riding to raise our community's awareness of racism and to support people demanding an end to violence and discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272715">I would like to take a moment to note the tragic death of Joyce Echaquan, which occurred under deplorable circumstances, and to express my deepest condolences to her family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272716">We must keep working together to gain ground in the fight against systemic racism and achieve gender equality and reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272717">We are proud to champion the values that define our country. This pandemic is the worst public health crisis Canada has ever experienced. The past six months have exposed fundamental flaws in our society and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272718">We must tackle today's problems and prepare for tomorrow's. Now is the time to remember who we are as Canadians. Now is the time to seize the opportunity to contain the global crisis and rebuild better together.</ParaText>

I would also like to thank my team in our constituency office and in Ottawa, who work as one cohesive group as we triage daily issues, for their hard work in ensuring that our constituents have been responded to quickly and given information or assistance as needed during a very challenging time with daily announcements and also with Service Canada office closures. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272743">Our hearts also go out to those who have lost loved ones during this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272744">This pandemic has created uncertainty for so many. Individuals, families, not-for-profits and businesses are having to make tough decisions and, at times, heartbreaking ones. During the course of this pandemic, I heard from countless constituents and business owners in my riding that the programs the government was implementing simply were not working for them. Families have been separated and many still have limited access to each other. People have passed away, either from COVID-19 or other ailments, including in my family, and it has been tough for everyone in different ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272745">The last time Parliament sat with its full functions and usual powers was on Friday, March 13, 2020. I took a picture on that day, which I posted on my social media last week, of the calendar right here after we voted to adjourn in response to the spread of COVID-19. I had a feeling it was going to be an important date in our Canadian history and was compelled to capture it as we were filtering out of the House of Commons. Little did I know at the time how significant it would actually be and what the next many months would bring us, or that the next time we would be back at regular sittings with all functions and powers of Parliament would not be until six months later, on September 23.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272746">Some committees, but not all, sat virtually since March. Important committees such as natural resources, justice and human rights, and national defence have not sat once since March, and many other meetings sat infrequently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272747"> It is unbelievable that the government had the international trade committee sit only once since March. I have been honoured with this as my new shadow cabinet ministerial portfolio. There have been important issues we should have been discussing, causing great concern to Canadian businesses. China still has agricultural products embargoed. Canada's trade agreement with the European Union, CETA, will no longer apply to the United Kingdom as of December 31. We received shipments of defective PPE from China. The U.S. put tariffs on aluminum. There were to be four committee meetings to discuss the trade dispute with Australia over excise taxes, which Canadian wineries and cideries will have to start paying on domestically grown product. This will mean, for example, a new $30,000 a year tax bill to small farm-gate wineries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272748">It is said that someone's true character shows during times of extreme, stressful situations; we saw the true character of the Liberals come out during this time. They just could not help themselves. Their desire for ultimate control, dislike of governance and the parliamentary process, and helping their elitist friends will be their legacy during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272749">Just a few examples include trying to pass legislation giving the finance minister ultimate power to tax, spend and borrow for almost two years, without debate or parliamentary process; not allowing all committees to be sitting virtually and regularly to discuss important issues to Canadians; an order in council in the middle of the pandemic on gun legislation that had no input from stakeholders at a committee so that all voices and facts could be heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272750"> We saw another example of the dislike for parliamentary oversight in a process here a couple of nights ago where some of us were in this place until after 3 a.m. Instead of properly bringing forth a bill weeks ago, a bill worth over $50 billion in taxpayer spending, for a wholesome analysis and debate and for study at committee to hear from everyday Canadians and stakeholders who would have brought their voices forth with ideas and suggestions, the Liberals allowed for only four and a half hours of debate and forced a confidence vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272751">The Liberals have given sole-source contracts with no public request for proposals. There was extensive lobbying with a non-registered lobbyist, of course I am referring to WE Charity; and they were planning on giving an almost-billion-dollar government program to active Liberal campaigners and supporters, again WE Charity, who showed clearly they did not have the financial or operational capacity to fulfill the program.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272752">I was here in Ottawa on August 12, one of only four times we were scheduled to sit this summer, and I had the opportunity to question the former finance minister. Little did I know at the time that I would be the last member of Parliament to question him prior to his resignation during all the conflict and ethics investigations over the WE Charity scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272753">We are here today debating a new throne speech, because on August 18, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced the prorogation of Parliament, triggering the second throne speech in under a year. He stated that he did so because we need a plan to help families, businesses and individuals and to relaunch the economy. This cancelled all sittings and scheduled committee meetings. This was a real shame, because I sit on the industry committee and we were slated to hear from businesses and industry associations regarding their challenges and recommendations as we work together to recover. I had submitted several names from my riding of Kelowna—Lake Country to bring their voices and ideas forth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272756">Much of the throne speech looks like it was cut and pasted from the last throne speech, which was 10 months ago.

              <ParaText id="6272757">We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who prefers to give speeches from podiums rather than to govern. This was shown a few days ago. When the Governor General had barely finished reading the throne speech, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went on national television to address the nation, basically paraphrasing what the Governor General had just read but in a partisan, election way. It was hardly a unifying and inspirational speech one would expect from the leader of a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272758">Unity and sovereignty are not mentioned in the throne speech. These are core values of our country and have been put in jeopardy by the government. The only time unity is mentioned in the throne speech is when it is part of another word, like “immunity”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272759">There is a large backlog in the processing of disability benefits for veterans. I received an email late last night from a veteran in my community who had been waiting for years for back payments for benefits. He was shortchanged because of an accounting error. The Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs has not met once since March, and we have learned that Legions across the country are in jeopardy of closing. They have been networking with their veterans. The service of veterans was only mentioned briefly, in a roundabout way, in the throne speech, with no acknowledgement of key issues to veterans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272762">Planting two billion trees was in the last throne speech, and planting two billion trees is in this throne speech. What a lost opportunity this summer. People who were looking for work could have been outdoors planting trees. There were volunteer opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272763">Businesses, particular small businesses, were mentioned, but there was nothing new or hopeful to grasp on to. There was no inspirational relaunching of the economy. There was only a listing of existing programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272764">Our important manufacturing, natural resource and energy sectors are mentioned briefly, but only in relation to climate change. They should be strong economic engines of our recovery. Businesses in all of these sectors are on hold, and not because of COVID-19 but because of uncertainty, thanks to the policies and ideologies of this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272765">The throne speech talks about creating one million jobs. Two million jobs were lost and one million have been recouped, but a lot of people are still out of work. If new jobs are to be created, we should be talking about the high-paying jobs that have been lost over the last couple of years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272766">The official opposition has made many recommendations to the government, which it has implemented as part of its program. I will continue to stand up for what is important to my constituents in Kelowna—Lake Country.</ParaText>

One business owner's revenue loss was only 68%, not 70%, and that made him ineligible for the program.</ParaText>

She is a strong addition to our government in waiting. I just want to let her know that her hard work is very much appreciated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272789">I would like to thank all of the workers in my community who have put their community first during 2020. From prevention to testing to treatment, people in the health care field, and those who have stepped into the health care field, have done so much for our community. We have essential workers who, in times of great uncertainty, continued to provide the services that we required of them, and everyday folks whose jobs were not declared essential soldiered on to continue to serve their friends, neighbours and family members: people working at grocery stores, repairing roads, collecting garbage or working at financial institutions. Whatever it was, they carried on in the face of adversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272790">Early in the pandemic, we were called on by the country to come together to provide the support that Canadians desperately needed. Giving credit where credit is due, there was a fast reaction from the government, but it needed a little help to get where it needed to be for Canadians. The wage subsidy is a great example of that. Through the work of all the members in this place, we were able to take it from the 10% proposed wage subsidy to the 75% that businesses were calling for, and that they so desperately needed to be able to keep businesses open and keep employees on the payroll. It is a tremendously important improved outcome created by the work of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272791">What also happened around that same time, early this year, was an unprecedented attempt at a power grab by the government, looking to tax and spend without parliamentary oversight until December of 2021. Parliament pushed back and we were able to stop that attempt at a power grab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272792">At that point we knew that the work of the government was going to require a close eye. That became so apparent during the summer months, when we learned that a company had paid members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family half a million dollars. His government saw fit to give that organization half a billion dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272793">At every turn, when members of the House or committee members tried to seek answers, they were faced with obstruction. They were faced with filibusters. The government wanted to deflect, duck and avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272794">While many Canadians were making tough decisions about how they were going to pay their mortgages or rent, and worried, looking ahead, about how they were going to heat their homes or how they were going to eat, the Liberals were looking out for their well-connected friends and the insiders: people with access to the halls of power and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office, believing that the executive had a set of rules that was different from the rest of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272795">We heard a great deal of testimony that was very damaging to the government, damaging to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and so damaging to the then finance minister that, in fact, Bill Morneau resigned in disgrace.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6272796">There were echoes of a scandal from the Liberals' first mandate, the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which saw the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> fire cabinet ministers and kick women out of his caucus who had the courage to stand up to him and speak truth to power. That was the subject of the Trudeau Report 2, in which he was found to have broken ethics laws when he interfered in the prosecution of his well-connected friends at SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272797">During that same mandate the Liberals had, there was also the Trudeau Report 1, in which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty of breaking ethics laws for his illegal trip to billionaire island, and now here we are. Canadians gave Liberals a reduced mandate and put them on notice. They shortened the leash, but the Prime Minister is under investigation again by the Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272798">While these investigations were going on and the government was being damaged, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shut down Parliament. He prorogued, breaking a promise that the Liberals would never prorogue. In fact, the Prime Minister marched in the streets against prorogation, stating he would never do it and would never try to avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272799">What did the Liberals do with those six weeks, aside from hiding from accountability? They did not get ready. They did not consult with stakeholders and opposition parties. They did not prepare to provide Canadians with the help they need. While all of our allies had approved rapid testing, we were into the second wave here in Canada. After weeks of opposition pressure, after we had come back, and after the doors had been unlocked after they had shut down Parliament, we put the pressure on for rapid tests. We were talking about rapid tests in March and are still asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> where they are. The government bought 7.9 million of those tests, but they were not approved. Suddenly, the next day, they were approved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272800">We have been calling for these tests but they are not in the hands of the government or Canadians yet. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says it is going to be a couple of weeks for the tests. How many schools are going to be closed in the next couple of weeks while Canadians wait for those tests? How many workplaces will close? How many more community outbreaks will occur? This is a failure of the Prime Minister, one of many during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272801">Canadians deserve better. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said a couple of weeks, but he had a couple of weeks. He had six weeks. However, the Liberals had to rush through the reforms to the emergency response benefit because they did not get ready. They did not use those six weeks. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> hid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272802">Let us talk about the commercial rent assistance program which has been, frankly, a disaster. It is expiring. There is nothing on the Notice Paper. There is no plan. The Liberals failed businesses. For many of the programs they have had, and in spite of urging from business groups, small business owners and the opposition parties, the criteria were often very narrow and excluded many Canadians. Many people in my community did not qualify for a single program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272803">For the six weeks the Liberals had, the Speech from the Throne fell very short of what Canadians deserve. What we did see, and what has been demonstrated to Canadians, is the importance of having this place, of having our parliamentary democracy and having a check on the power of government. The work that opposition members do is critical to the function of our democracy. Canadians get better outcomes when we do our work, when Parliament does its work and when committees do their work. That is what we are going to continue to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272804">As the official opposition, Canada's Conservatives are going to continue doing the work of holding the government to account. When the time comes, this government in waiting will act on the lessons learned during this pandemic, and we will continue to deliver for Canadians.</ParaText>

I also thank the businesses that give back to our communities through fundraising efforts, like Barque, which provided food to front-line workers, and the efforts of Cici’s Pizza in Parkdale and Scout in Roncesvalles Village to raise money for food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272832">I want to thank the organizations that have been going above and beyond the call in addressing the critical issue of food insecurity, which has always existed but has been acute during the pandemic. The most notable of these is the Tibetan Canadian Cultural Centre, which has provided the use of its industrial kitchen to Jagger Gordon at Feed it Forward so that their joint forces could deliver meals to those in need with the help of the Tibetan Women's Association of Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272833">I want to thank the advocates in my riding who have continued to shine a light on the need for things like climate action, addressing housing, and most recently, the continent-wide movement to confront systemic discrimination and anti-Black and anti-indigenous racism. I thank people like Debbie King, Ayan Kailie and Alexa Gilmour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272834">As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, the story of Canada is about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. This rings true with the residents of Parkdale—High Park, who I am proud to represent here in Ottawa. I outline these attributes and achievements not simply because of what people have been doing in my riding during the pandemic, but because of what their actions have taught us about the pandemic, the fault lines and vulnerabilities they have exposed and the opportunities they have highlighted to build back better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272835">Let me now turn to the throne speech and the priorities we are outlining for the next session of Parliament and our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272836">The first is that the path back to economic recovery starts with a plan to crush the coronavirus itself. This is why addressing the health care needs that relate to the virus is the lead pillar outlined in the throne speech. This means investing heavily in things like domestic supply chains for personal protective equipment. It means investing in research and development to develop a domestic vaccine. It also means procuring the supply of promising potential vaccines that are being developed abroad. It means putting in $19 billion, as we have already, to help all the provinces and territories with the safe restart of our economy. This is fundamental because, without a health plan, we do not have an economic plan and path forward to recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272837">Another thematic point I have learned from my constituents and my capacity as a member of Parliament and parliamentary secretary is that any plan for an economic recovery must start with women. We are in the midst of a “she-cession”. What we need to get out of this “she-cession” is a “she-covery”. These are terms that have been coined in the last few months that very aptly describe where we are as a nation. That is why we heard very active commitments outlined in the throne speech with respect to engaging women more robustly in this economic recovery and a commitment to an action plan specifically for women and their full participation in the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272838">We also saw a commitment to nationwide child care, which has been the subject of much discussion on the floor of the House over the past several days. People say they have heard that before and ask why they should believe people this time around. I understand their frustration. I remember some of those commitments being made by past governments. What is important now is that this is the first time in 16 years any federal government has come to the table in the form of a throne speech or a budget statement and said that, nationwide, child care is a priority. That is a critical commitment, and what I am dealing with here and now is the renewed vigour and interest in that commitment. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6272839">What am I talking about? To be candid, I am talking about people like me. For far too long, the notion of child care and a universal nationwide child care program has been deemed to be the purview of women of child-bearing age. The critics would call it a 25- to 35-year-old female issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272840">What this pandemic has exposed to all of us, working from home, juggling and trying to balance caring for people who are ill and looking after children with the competing demands of work, is that the current system is not working. What we need is robust child care. By addressing robust and universal child care, we can fulfill the commitment we have repeatedly made that we want to ensure women's full participation in the economy. It is time to achieve and move on this demand. It is good that men, particularly men in this country who have now been through and are still going through the pandemic, are getting on board with this important idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272841">The third issue is that we cannot recover from this virus or even prepare for the next one, and indeed there may be a next one coming, when isolation and quarantine at home is critical but too many do not have a safe and secure place to isolate, a place to call home, as we have heard so often in the vernacular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272842">Housing has to be addressed. Housing has to be part of a plan to build back and build back better. That means owning homes, renting affordable homes and supportive housing. Those three planks of our national housing strategy were announced three years back, with funding to the tune of over $50 billion, but what is very recent is that we made a commitment in the last two weeks to put $1 billion around the country into a rapid housing industry, or RHI, which will do things like build modular homes quickly for people who are in acute housing crisis and need homes to be built now. These are important steps in the right direction for things, as the pandemic has exposed and my constituents have explained to me, where the needs are acute. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272843">I represent a riding in the city of Toronto. Much like many other urban centres around this country, we are experiencing an acute homelessness issue, a homelessness crisis, which has to be addressed. It is not sufficient when people are unable to be housed. Not only are they not able to look after themselves but they are also not able to curb the spread of this virus. What we are doing is upping our ante with respect to homelessness. We are saying that we will commit to ending chronic homelessness. The previous commitment our government made was to reduce it by about 50% over a period of years. We are saying that is not sufficient, and we are upping the priority and making a bold commitment to end chronic homelessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272844">The fourth issue is that the recovery must not only build back better but also greener. People have been captivated by what we have seen in terms of a lower carbon footprint and animal life surfacing all around us, etc. They have also raised concerns about the usage of single-use plastics during the pandemic, when people were using single-use plastics at much higher levels. We are addressing things on both ends. We are committing to conservation measures. We are also renewing our commitment to ban the harmful use of single-use plastics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272845">We are also embracing where the economy is going, as well as what a just transition for workers looks like in terms of embracing a green economy by focusing on clean tech, clean infrastructure and zero-emission vehicles. Part of the million jobs plan we have for this country will involve this new economy, a greener economy, and we will continue to price pollution, an important statement that was reiterated in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272846">The last theme I will discuss is the commitment to ending systemic racism and confronting discrimination. In the wake of what we have seen in the United States and are seeing here in Canada, this is a critical need. It is something I personally have believed in and advocated for all of my adult life. I am glad to see so much interest in it across all sectors of Canada, across all racial demographics and across all groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272847">People want to see change. What are those changes? We are redoubling our work on reconciliation. We are working hard to have diversity and procurement. We will address overrepresentation in prisons and corrections through diversion and rehab. We will enact standards about the appropriate use of force and address online hate, something I had the privilege to work on all summer long in my capacity as parliamentary secretary. We are addressing seniors' needs with national standards and with beefed up amendments to the Criminal Code about the neglect of seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272848"> What all these themes represent is that we are listening. We are listening to what we have heard from Canadians during this pandemic and as we continue to fight this pandemic. Therefore, those views have shaped our priorities. These are important initiatives that I hope we can have all-party support for, and I look forward to working with members opposite to enact these bold visions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272849">Madam Speaker, one thing that I wanted to touch on, which is affecting many small businesses in my riding, is a need for commercial rent assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272850">I was glad to see that the government is committed to extending the wage subsidy, because we know that small businesses have two major fixed costs. One is labour, which will be handled with the emergency wage subsidy, but the other is commercial rent assistance. The problem so many small businesses are having is that when they have an uncooperative landlord, who is unwilling to engage with the program, they are left with no options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272851">I had a business in my community that was called Sports Traders. It ran for 25 years and was a bedrock member of the small business community of Duncan, but it went under because of an uncooperative landlord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272852">I would like to hear the parliamentary secretary's comments on how the government is going to fix this program and make it so that tenants are not dependent on landlords to access those funds.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272853">Madam Speaker, my thanks to the member opposite for his contribution to the House during this Parliament and the previous Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272854">The rent issue is not a simple one. I will be very candid here in saying that. Based on the division of powers in the Constitution, we require intense participation and co-operation on the part of the provinces. Some provinces have been more forthcoming in terms of providing that co-operation; others have not. That has been a challenge. What we are trying to do is to ensure that we are putting in place programs that would incentivize landlords to participate and provinces to play ball with respect to rent assistance. The wage subsidy that the member mentioned is also an important step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272855"> There are also commitments in the throne speech to expand the CEBA, which is, in part, a grant-based program, where 25% would be in the form of a grant and the rest would be an interest-free loan, to assist with small businesses in terms of overcoming the very serious problems that they are facing right now with the pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272856">Madam Speaker, I will continue in the same vein and ask the member to comment on the numerous failures that have been identified within the very programs he discussed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272857">The government talks about extending the CEBA, yet it still has not fixed the problems that have already been identified, problems that the government has already acknowledged and promised to fix. However, they are still not fixed. Many small business persons still cannot even get CEBA as it is. The commercial rent program, which the previous questioner spoke of, ended yesterday as a complete policy failure and not a word about it in the throne speech. These problems are failures that the government has not fixed so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272858">Can the member comment on the problems the government already has, never mind the new programs they discussed in the throne speech?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6272859">Madam Speaker, the issues of small businesses are replete around the country. There is no denying that. The issue of fine-tuning the programs is also a completely fair comment, but this is very much a dynamic process. When programs are being rolled out in eight to 18 days, programs that would normally take eight to 18 months, there will be some lacuna, some voids or some gaps that are identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272860">What we have done is worked diligently with the civil service to identify those gaps, to hear from opposition parliamentarians and government parliamentarians about where the gaps are, and to fill them, for example by expanding the eligibility on the lower end and on the higher end with respect to the business account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272861">With respect to rent assistance, it is at the foremost of all of our minds that rent assistance is critical for small businesses facing landlords who do not want to participate in these programs. Designing them in a better way that incentivizes landlords is the magic that we are trying to ensure is achieved here, but that requires provincial co-operation and the co-operation of the landlords themselves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272921">We are here to debate the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. Perhaps we should first ask ourselves why there was a Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272922">The government had not even gotten through the first items on its legislative agenda from the previous throne speech, which was delivered barely a year ago. Then the government sidelined Parliament for months, preventing it from passing legislation and implementing this legislative agenda. Why did the government suddenly decide to prorogue Parliament and come back with another Speech from the Throne?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272923">We need to look back at the context of the prorogation. What was happening then?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272924">At the time, four parliamentary committees were studying the WE Charity scandal, the government did not know how to handle the matter, and the resignation of the finance minister had not taken the pressure off. <I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272925">In a situation like that, what better way to take the pressure off than to completely shut down Parliament? They had already sidelined it for months, and then they decided to shut it down altogether. The committees that had started working on WE Charity were told, “Game over! Hit the showers!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272926">We figured that they were raising the stakes, that we would get a substantial throne speech announcing something new, because they had not even been able to carry out the legislative agenda from the previous throne speech that had been delivered only a few months earlier. We thought they would have something big for us, especially since they announced there would also be an address to the nation, which is an exceptional event, a very rare occurrence. We thought we should all sit down in front of the TV, because something absolutely spectacular was coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272927">Let me point out to my colleagues that the opposition parties have been working with the government since the pandemic hit, because we felt it was the right thing to do. All but one party ended up regretting it. The government took advantage and started acting like a majority government, ignoring any positive input it might have received from Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272928">The work of Parliament was suspended, in came a throne speech, and we were all glued to our screens, sitting on the edge of our seats, wondering what would be announced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272929">In the end, we got nothing but platitudes and recycled promises from last year. The government told us to wash our hands and maintain social distancing and announced what it had already been doing for months, namely being generous to everyone and their dog and throwing around money that it does not have to get Canada through the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272930">Lord knows it has been tough to get through this crisis so far, in part because, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252775" Type="2">Thérèse-De Blainville</Affiliation> said earlier, the government has utterly failed to do its job within its own jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272931">When it came time to close the borders, the government once again sat on its hands, wasting weeks. In the meantime, the virus, which was not yet present in the community, made its way into the country. The government's reaction was so pathetic that the mayor of Montreal had to send teams to Dorval airport to warn travellers who were arriving in Canada. That went on for at least two weeks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6272932">The government is continuing to hand out money, but the only people it has not been generous with are supply-managed farmers, despite a formal agreement to compensate them. The government is generous with everyone but supply-managed farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272933">The government has also not been generous with seniors. It is giving them peanuts. It is thanks to seniors that the government has so much flexibility and the privilege of a certain prosperity. The government owes that prosperity to seniors and it has forgotten them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272934">What is worse, the government has now created two classes of seniors, younger seniors and older seniors. It is as though there is a huge difference between the age of 74 and a few months and 75, as though a person somehow all of a sudden needs more help as soon as they turn 75.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272935">Obviously, Quebec and the provinces have been neglected by the current government. Yesterday, I heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, all happy and proud, say that, at the beginning of the crisis, the government gave the provinces nearly $1 billion to deal with the pandemic. That is nearly $1 billion to ensure that 10 provinces and three territories are able to deal with the pandemic. That is right: $1 billion. He was all proud and happy to tell us that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272936">This same government was prepared to give $1 billion to an organization that is close to the Trudeau family to manage a program that would pay people to volunteer. What is the thinking behind paying people to volunteer? The very definition of volunteering does not square with the idea of getting paid to do so. The government wanted to give this organization millions of dollars in fees to manage the program. This government thinks $1 billion for a Liberal-friendly organization is not too much, but then claims it is being generous by offering $1 billion to support Canada's health care system during a pandemic. That is amazing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272937">When we say that makes no sense, that more support needs to go to the provinces, which are struggling to meet intense demands with the resources they have, the government tells us with contempt and in a patronizing way that we are asking for a blank cheque, for money to be sent without any strings attached, no guidelines and no conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272938">The reality is that it was the provinces that gave the federal government a blank cheque when it proposed an agreement that would create a single health care system from coast to coast to coast. To get the provinces on board, the federal level proposed paying 50% of the bill. Now it assumes only 22% of the cost. We trusted the federal government and we were ripped off. Once again it failed to keep its promise, and now it is talking to us about blank cheques.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272939">Just pay the provinces what you owe them. Give the provinces what is rightly theirs. It was the provinces that gave the federal government a blank cheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272940">While the government lectures Quebec and the provinces about what happened in long-term care centres, the reality is that on top of paying 78% of Canada's health care costs, the governments of Quebec and the provinces assume 100% of the costs associated with seniors' needs and care. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272941">The government wants to stomp all over us once again and is proposing an agreement with conditions attached if we want the money. We will never accept it.</ParaText>

The answer is yes, but it has to be done properly. The government plainly admitted that there was a problem with the CERB, not because it rewarded laziness, as some have claimed, but simply because it did not encourage full-time work. Rather than fix a problem that even it had recognized, the government doubled down and created even more problems.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272958">Madam Speaker, the NDP has long supported the principle of asymmetrical federalism because we recognize that Quebec has its own distinct history, language and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272959">However, I would like to ask my Bloc Québécois colleague the following question. Are the reasons for greater autonomy for Quebec based on this distinct culture and history, or is my colleague saying that, as a province, Quebec has provincial rights like all the other provinces and this comes down to recognizing the rights of all the provinces?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6272960">Madam Speaker, whether we like it or not, Quebec is one of the provinces in this federation. The Constitution sets out a certain number of powers that belong to the provinces and, consequently, to Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272961">When the federal government negotiates a health care agreement with the provinces, the expectation is that it will abide by and respect the agreement signed. We know that sometimes the federal government's signature is not worth the paper it is written on. Here we can add my colleague's very pertinent arguments on the particular history, evolution and development of Quebec, which make it—without wanting to seem presumptuous—a distinct province and a distinct society. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252602" Type="2">Mr. Sébastien Lemire (Abitibi—Témiscamingue, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6272962">Madam Speaker, our reading of the throne speech makes it clear that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> government has once again ignored Quebec's demands. It is actually very hard to find any concrete answers to people's demands in the throne speech. I myself do not see any.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272963">We want measures for our farmers, especially measures that address compensation, the importance of getting cheques quickly and the agriculture programs that do not reflect the reality of small farmers. We want answers about the aerospace industry, but we did not get any.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272964">SMEs are another issue, specifically partnerships, business owners who pay themselves dividends and very small businesses. Liquidity issues are going to be huge. With all the problems suppliers are having and the whole fixed-costs issue, I am worried we are going to see a spate of bankruptcies. None of that is in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272965">The Liberal plan also involves interfering in areas under provincial jurisdiction, such as health and infrastructure, by investing money without going through the Government of Quebec. The Government of Quebec is opposed to that, of course, and is backed up by the Canadian Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272966">What about the increased health transfers called for by Quebec and the other provinces? There is nothing about that in the speech. How to explain that Canadians have to wait until the age of 75 before getting help? It is impossible. COVID-19 has real-world implications. I will share two examples from my riding. The Agora des arts, a theatre and concert hall, has undertaken a major renovation. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has made the bids skyrocket by 60%. A project that was supposed to cost about $5 million will now cost about $9 million. The federal government's contribution was already limited at 14%. The Government of Quebec covered the majority of the costs, but the community also invested $700,000 to get this project completed. The project is now in jeopardy because of COVID-19, but there are no programs to help in this case. I am very worried, and I am calling on the <Affiliation DbId="253406" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> to ensure that the federal government will join the Government of Quebec in contributing to the project. I also encourage the people of Abitibi-Témiscamingue to show their support for the Agora des arts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272967">Then there is the issue of the Resolute Forest Products paper mill in Amos, which is facing an extended shutdown. This is happening in my area, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, on the North Shore and in other regions of Quebec. We need to create a recovery committee and I would like to be able to propose real solutions to promote the recovery and help processing. Can we capitalize on secondary and tertiary processing? I would like to be able to say that I am building on federal government solutions but, for now, that is not the case. People can count on me: I will be very involved in this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272968">The solutions are not in the plan entitled “A Stronger and More Resilient Canada” but in the document known as “Le Québec choisit, le Bloc agit”. That is recognized. The Bloc's COVID-19 recovery plan is strong and practical and based on what people in Quebec's regions are asking for. My leader and all the Bloc members went to meet with Quebeckers. They listened to them and came up with real solutions. I will name several of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272969">There is the whole issue of people who are receiving the Canada emergency response benefit. We are very concerned about that. These people are going to have to pay back the money they were given. Could that not have been addressed beforehand? Obviously, the answer is no. It is the same thing with the problems that the lack of employment incentives have caused for businesses. Businesses were looking for workers. Could the government consider giving non-fraudulent CERB recipients an eight-month grace period on any penalties and interest they have to pay when they file their taxes? It is going to be chaos in our 338 riding offices this spring. We will be getting a huge number of calls from people who are unable to pay back the thousands of dollars they owe as a result of the CERB.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272970">We are talking about increasing federal health transfers to 35% with no strings attached. I would remind members that, under the initial agreement set out in the Constitution, the federal government is supposed to cover 50% of health care costs. I am tired of being told that my province is poor when Canada is not paying the share it owes Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272971">I will continue by talking about the recovery plan. Quebec deserves the truth about the country's public finances. Will the government provide its fiscal projections for the next three years? That is fundamental. Can it give our business owners and our governments an idea of what to expect? It seems to me that that is just common sense.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6272972">The Bloc Québécois is proposing new revenue sources to restore the economy. In particular, we must stop tax avoidance by large corporations that use tax havens. That way, the government could recoup billions of dollars and help the provinces and the less fortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272973">We could force tech giants to pay GST. We could also charge a 3% royalty on their Canadian operations. The royalty would go to arts and media organizations that deliver 40% French-language content. We need to stop saying that we are proud to be a country whose two official languages are French and English, and we need to take concrete action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272974">The moving expense deduction for oil, gas and coal companies could be eliminated. Legislative amendments could be made to collect sales tax from retailers without a local place of business, including on tangible goods purchased from abroad and online. What I find absolutely astounding is that it costs more to send a parcel through Canada Post. For example, Miellerie de la Grande Ourse sells two jars of honey for $12, but Canada Post's fees push the cost to $30. How can our businesses stay competitive? If that parcel were sent from the United States, it would cost less due to international agreements. I do not understand the logic. We need to support our businesses more, especially by lowering transportation costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272975">There are concrete ways to support economic recovery in our regions. How can we develop a collective, pragmatic vision? The answer is economic nationalism. For example, we could create a regional development, recovery and economic diversification fund geared toward processing natural resources in Quebec. Regional funds like these could be administered by regional councils empowered to set their own priorities for our own resources in collaboration with Quebec. This could be done for various sectors, such as aluminum, forestry and farming. In my riding, a territorial innovation support fund could be used to build a slaughterhouse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272976">I think one great idea is to use the infrastructure of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, but its budget will have to be increased and indexed retroactively so that it can provide concrete assistance to our SMEs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272977">We could bring workers back to the regions by creating a tax credit for young graduates, newcomers and families who settle in the regions. COVID-19 is an opportunity to encourage people to move back to Quebec's regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272978">Federal programs have to be more flexible and adapt to different realities in each of Quebec's regions. No more unilateral solutions, because they are bad for us. Employment insurance clearly needs a complete overhaul so that it covers all workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272979">With regard to agriculture, it is time to stop selling out supply management in future negotiations and start compensating farmers without delay. A lot of promises have been made to farmers, but they are still waiting for their cheques. Then we have to promote local agriculture and let Quebec take over the management of the temporary foreign workers program, which has been disastrous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272980">As far as fisheries are concerned, a domestic market needs to be developed by improving distribution networks and promoting lesser-known seafood products. This would help reduce our dependence on foreign markets. All of this comes with a cost. Why is fish from China cheaper than fish from the Gaspé Peninsula? I will never understand that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272981">When it comes to transportation and infrastructure, Ottawa needs to commit to contributing unconditional funding for upgrading Route 117, which is notorious in my region as the site of countless accidents. It is a dangerous highway back home in Abitibi—Témiscamingue and in Laurentides—Labelle. This is a trans-Canadian highway. The federal government should contribute. It should also support the regional airports' development plans and encourage a Quebec alternative to Air Canada's virtual monopoly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272982">We are concerned. The NAV Canada issue had repercussions. If we want our regions to be autonomous and have a strong economy, then investments need to be made in our infrastructure, in our airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272983">We need support for programs that help people who work in the tourism industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272984">The government can help the region of Montreal. I talk a lot about the regions of Quebec because that is where I am from. Fighting climate change is crucial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272985">The Speech from the Throne only makes me more of a sovereignist. After all, if you want something done right, you are better off doing it yourself.</ParaText>

The AgriStability and AgriInvest programs are simply not working. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6272991">Getting back to the question of financial compensation, we are talking about a first and second cheque, and about a deal reached several years ago. We are also talking about the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the comprehensive economic and trade agreement with Europe. There is still nothing for the Canada-United States-Mexico agreement, and I think that is appalling. We want our farmers to survive so they can ensure our food security and food sovereignty.

              <ParaText id="6273004">I rise today in a virtual manner to first and foremost thank you, Madam Speaker, and all the House staff for making our participation in this virtual Parliament possible. It is important to be able to have MPs across the country participate, and while I would much rather be in Ottawa physically, I am pleased to be able to represent my constituents here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273005">Given this is my first address in the new session of Parliament, I want to recognize two things before addressing the Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273006">First, I want to recognize that today is Treaty Day. I am privileged to represent communities across the riding of Kings—Hants, including three indigenous communities: Sipekne'katik, Glooscap and the Annapolis Valley First Nation. Sipekne'katik was involved in the signing in the peace and friendship treaties with the British Crown back in the 1700s, whose agreements form a key basis of the Government of Canada's relationship with indigenous peoples today. I wanted to recognize Treaty Day at the beginning of my remarks and join those in my community and across the country who are celebrating today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273007">Second, I want to acknowledge and thank my constituents for their hospitality and caring for others during a difficult time. Of course, it was and remains COVID-19 where constituents helped by making masks, delivering groceries and providing fresh produce to those who needed it. These are just a few examples, but I could honestly create an entire speech simply on the kindness that was shown since COVID-19 and in the days following the Nova Scotia mass shooting, and I want to recognize those efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273008">As it relates to the Speech from the Throne, there were many themes that I think are important for the communities I represent, indeed, all Canadians. In the time I have remaining, I will highlight some of those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273009">I will start by saying that Canada is still in the midst of fighting the pandemic, and while I sit here in Nova Scotia where we are fortunate to have a very low case count, we are seeing a rise across the country and, indeed, across the world. That is why I thought it was prudent that the first half of the Speech from the Throne was focused on efforts to continue fighting the virus while supporting Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273010">We have already taken significant measures as a government to protect Canadians' health and economic security. As it relates to health, there have been direct investments to the provinces, including the safe restart agreement, with $19 billion to support measures such as greater testing capacity, improved testing, support for the purchase of personal protective equipment for health care facilities and resources to municipalities across the country that are on the front lines, frankly, of delivering key services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273011">This summer, I had the chance to connect with my constituents directly on their doorsteps. As we approached September, the back-to-school plan was the top priority, whether it was grandparents wondering about their grandchildren's plans for going back to school or parents wondering how they could balance jobs and whether their children were going to be safe. This is why I am proud of the government for investing $2 billion to provide support directly to the provinces so that they have the resources necessary to keep our kids, teachers and staff safe, which I know has been a conversation we have heard a lot in the House over the last couple of months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273012">Programs such as the Canadian emergency response benefit, the wage subsidy and the emergency business account have benefited millions of Canadians and protected their jobs. I would like to highlight investments through the regional relief and recovery fund, which allowed local development agencies, such as the Hants-Kings Community Business Development Corporation, to provide funding to businesses that needed help and did not meet eligibility criteria in other programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273013">Given the importance of agriculture in my riding, and I mention this every time I get the chance, nearly $500 million of COVID-19-related support provided to various commodity groups was welcomed and will be important to reducing the negative impacts felt in the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273014">In my riding, I have spoken to many business owners, individual employees, those who have had to stay home to look after a loved one and seniors who benefited from additional top-ups under the old age security. These investments and programs have ensured that Canadians stayed safe and have helped our economy avoid the worst impacts. However, there remains a lot of important work to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273015">I represent a riding with many jobs of family members, friends and neighbours tied to the Halifax Stanfield International Airport. There are thousands of jobs in Kings—Hants tied directly and indirectly to the vitality of our airport. I was pleased to see mention of airports and airlines in the Speech from the Throne. While we know that air travel will not return to normal any time soon as a result of the pandemic, it is important for us, particularly in rural communities, to have transportation links that can connect us as a country and serve as a gateway to the world beyond our borders. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273016">I was also pleased to see a commitment from the government to expand the Canada emergency business account to support businesses that are the hardest hit by helping support their fixed and overhead costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273017">I have said this many times, but I will say it again. Kings—Hants is home to the highest tides in the world and it is an emerging wine region with hospitality second to none. I hope my colleagues and, indeed, all Canadians will consider visiting when they feel comfortable in doing so. However, I have heard many tourism and hospitality operators and business owners whose model is built around bringing people together who have suffered greatly, so I was very pleased to see mention of the tourism and hospitality sectors in the Speech from the Throne and I look forward to our government's work to support them in the days ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273018">I was also heartened to note that the government has committed to promoting affordable housing. Affordable housing is often referenced as solely an urban issue. It is not. This matter is in the community that I represent and in many rural communities across the country, in particular, by adding the national housing strategy and increasing investments to rapid housing in the short term. We saw that with the $1-billion announcement by our government about a week and a half ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273019">I want to mention one development. The Ryan's Park development in Kentville, the community that I represent, serves as an ideal example of what can be achieved through solid public partnerships and the right vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273020">I know this topic has been discussed in the House as of late, but I was also encouraged to see rapid testing as a top priority for our government. Given the fact that COVID-19 is likely to be a reality for many Canadians at least in the year ahead or perhaps longer, this is going to be an important tool for us to try to adapt to what is, frankly, our new normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273021">Finally, as aforementioned, child care and early education are top of mind for Canadians across the country and I was very pleased to see a focus on early education and a national strategy for after-school programs. Of course, we have provinces that are able to deliver that, but us working with the provinces and territories is important. We have seen that collaboration throughout the pandemic and this is an important step forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273022">While our focus must remain on the challenge at hand, we cannot forget about other challenges and opportunities that Canada needs to address, and I would like to address some of the build back better aspects of the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273023">We knew rural connectivity was a challenge before the pandemic. We had invested $500 million under the connect to innovate program and the universal broadband fund and accelerating that is going to be extremely important because we have seen the divide between rural and urban Canada in terms of connectivity. It is like not having electricity in the 21st century. I look forward to our government and all parliamentarians helping support us on that initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273024">I also want to talk about greening the economy. This was a top issue in my riding during the last election. Of course, it is across the country and, indeed, the world. I really appreciate the reference to working with rural industries to help transition them and be ready to be competitive in a low-carbon economy. That is things like agriculture, forestry and mining. It is extremely important that our government work hand in hand with these industries to have them ready to compete in a low-carbon economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273025">I will quickly mention the Atlantic loop, the coal to clean strategy. We have a tremendous opportunity in Atlantic Canada, in partnership with Quebec, to have electricity that is zero-emitting by 2025. This is going to open up a world of opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273026">Platform commitments around old age security, a 10% boost for those over 75, I know will be extremely important in Kings—Hants. I hear from seniors often about the fact that they have challenges in dealing with increasing costs and I was pleased to see that, along with a plan for national pharmacare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273027">I mentioned agriculture in my riding. One of the silver linings of COVID-19 has been the benefit to local agriculture. Canadians across the country are focused on where their food is coming from. We have seen that the agri-food industry has become very centralized. We need to position ourselves to feed the world, but we also need to be mindful of making sure that our regional and domestic supply chains are strong and that we can support local farmers. It will not only help the local economy, but it will also help for environmental reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273028">The final thing I will mention, which was in my remarks before I joined in today, was around the SM5. I was very pleased to see the continued support for our supply-managed sectors. I have the greatest concentration of supply-managed farms east of Montreal and this is extremely important in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273029">I am pleased to say that I will be supporting the Speech from the Throne. It is a Speech from the Throne that puts Canadians at the centre of its work and I look forward to working with all parliamentarians to address the needs of Canadians in the days ahead.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273030">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's speech, but the problem I have is that many things in this particular throne speech are recycled rhetoric from elections past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273031">The member raised the issue of Internet access. The government has been promising to service rural areas and it has not gotten the job done. In fact, the Liberals go so far as to criticize the previous government on other issues, such as addressing climate change, but their own government allows an extension for coal-fired plants in Nova Scotia. Tires have been burned in his province to generate electricity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273034">The first is digital connectivity. We know it cannot come soon enough. I will point out that one million Canadians have been connected since we formed government in 2015 and that through the connect to innovate program, over $500 million has been invested. Had the Conservative government, during the 2008 recession, put a similar amount of focus on connecting Canadians, we might have been way further along than where we are today. Regardless, under the universal broadband fund we are going to continue those efforts. As chair of the rural caucus of the governing party, I will continue to push for these efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273035">I also want to address the member's comments about Nova Scotia. We are one of the leading jurisdictions within the federation when it comes to using renewable energy to fuel our electricity. I find it a bit disingenuous for him to suggest that Nova Scotia is not a leader on this. Of course, there are agreements for coal-fired generation, but we are one of the leaders in the country, and the Atlantic loop will help us get there even quicker.</ParaText>

I am a member of Parliament from the opposite coast. The government spent $4.5 billion buying a pipeline that puts my coast at risk. It is also an economic and environmental disaster. Over 100 economists just wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asking him to rethink Trans Mountain given that it no longer makes sense economically.</ParaText>

However, that particular investment was about the safety of communities and the fact that product would be going to international markets.

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252591" Type="2">Mr. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith (Beaches—East York, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6273048">Madam Speaker, at the outset, I want to thank every constituent in Beaches—East York and every Canadian across our country who has stepped up in these difficult times, whether they are essential front-line workers in health care, grocery stores or food supply chains, or whether they are teachers or individuals looking after loved ones. I give sincere thanks to everyone who has stepped up and made a difference in these really difficult times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273049">In the throne speech, we have seen a comprehensive set of old commitments, from the 2019 platform, mixed with a set of new commitments that respond to lessons learned in the course of this pandemic. I want to focus on lessons learned and what we can glean from the throne speech in answer to those lessons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273050">First, it is important to recognize that we face an economic crisis because of the health crisis and that the best economic response is also a public health response. In the short term, that means a massive rapid-testing program, and in the long term, that means a vaccine. In the throne speech, we heard our government commit to doing everything it can to see rapid tests deployed, upon approval. With respect to a vaccine, the government notes that Canada has already secured access to vaccine candidates and therapeutics, while it is investing in manufacturing here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273051">Second, our social safety net was not fit for the purposes of millions of Canadians. When we look at the CERB numbers, we see there were almost nine million unique applications. Almost nine million Canadians received income support in their time of need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273052">Our social safety net, specifically employment insurance, was not fit to answer to this crisis. Our government's new EI recovery benefit will ensure that most people will be supported in the coming six months. That is important because there was a lot of angst from people who were worried the CERB was going to end. They now know they are going to receive supports through the EI system in the months ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273053">However, fundamentally, we need a permanently strengthened social safety net. I have pushed within caucus and outside of caucus for a permanent minimum floor below which nobody will fall in our society. In a wealthy country like ours, we should not have the poverty levels we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273054">My third point is about essential workers. I mentioned at the outset a need to thank essential workers, but we have to do more: We need to protect essential workers. That fundamentally means ensuring that there is leadership. I know provincial minimum wages matter more than a federal one, but we should lead through a federal minimum wage, as we committed to doing in 2019. It also behooves us to ensure that we work with provinces for portable benefits. Where there is federal jurisdiction, we should also ensure that we are updating our competition laws to address wage fixing. We have seen concerns there recently, and certainly I saw concerns there through my work on the industry committee, where our national grocers communicated directly about the prospect of ending pandemic pay premiums for front-line workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273055">We also need to recognize our migrant workers, who are so often our essential workers, whether on farms or in health care settings. We need to ensure that we are protecting migrant workers and ending the systemic exploitation of them. This means prioritizing permanent residency through immigration work programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273056">In the throne speech we see language that says, “We owe an immense debt to those who served and still serve on the frontlines...earning the lowest wages in the most precarious sectors...on the frontlines of the pandemic.” It also notes, “Canadian and migrant workers who produce, harvest, and process our food...deserve the Government’s full support and protection.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273057">Fourth, a lack of supportive housing has undermined isolation efforts, and existing supportive housing, especially for-profit nursing homes, has failed our seniors. We need more supportive housing, but also national standards for nursing homes and increased staff and training levels, with a focus on non-profit care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273058">In the throne speech we see a commitment to a conversation with provinces about national standards for our nursing homes. We see a commitment to targeted measures for personal support workers to provide increased supports. We see language that says, “No one should be without a place to stay during a pandemic, or for that matter, a Canadian winter.” It also references a recent $1-billion announcement that is focused on eliminating chronic homelessness. Importantly, with regard to old commitments and new commitments, there is an important new commitment in this throne speech to ending chronic homelessness in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273059">Fifth, the economic fallout has disproportionately affected women, and we know that child care is a significant answer. Our federal government has taken important steps over the last five years to support child care, but we need to build on these efforts. In the throne speech we see a commitment to building on these efforts. We see an acknowledgement that we must not let the legacy of the pandemic be one of rolling back the clock on women's participation in the workforce.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273060">Canadians need more accessible, affordable, inclusive and high-quality child care. The government will make a significant long-term sustained commitment to create a Canada-wide early learning and child care system. Also important to note is that there is a renewed attention to before- and after-school care, an acknowledgement that flexible care options for young children are more important than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273061">Sixth, the twin health and economic crises have disproportionately affected people of colour. We need to double down on our efforts to address systemic racism and reconciliation. Working to end poverty will make the biggest inroads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273062">As an aside, during the course of this pandemic, I had the opportunity to spend a considerable amount of time reading and learning more about a number of different issues. I read the last writing of Martin Luther King, Jr., <I>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?</I>, from 1967. More than 50 years ago, this leader was focused on tackling racism and speaking about the need to end poverty. Of course we need criminal justice reform, but we also need to focus on our social safety net, not only as a matter of justice for essential workers and people in poverty, but also if we are serious about addressing systemic racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273063">We also need to focus on reconciliation. In the throne speech we see acknowledgements that we need to keep moving even faster: We are going to work toward a national action plan for missing and murdered indigenous women; we are going to have UNDRIP legislation before the end of the year; and we are going to continue to work to close the infrastructure gap and make sure there is clean water in every community. I said this in answer to the first throne speech, but I will reiterate it again: We need more attention to our urban indigenous communities. As we know, here in Ontario, over 80% of indigenous Canadians live in our urban centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273064">Seventh, we have listened to public health experts to save lives in this pandemic and need to continue to heed their advice to address the opioid epidemic. That work should include a federal task force to reset our national drug strategy, which has been called for by police chiefs, and action toward decriminalization and safer supply projects. We have heard so many different voices: Public health experts across our country have called for this conversation; police chiefs have called for this conversation; the Chief Justice of Ontario has called for this conversation; and people who have lost loved ones have called for this conversation. Every serious person who has looked at this issue has said the current drug prohibition framework is killing people and that we need drug policy reform to save lives. I hope we have a serious conversation about this and put the politics aside to save lives going forward in the same way we have put politics aside in the course of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273065">Eighth, our government can respond quickly and successfully to a crisis with determination, and we need that same level of determination brought to a green recovery and the climate crisis. The throne speech rightly acknowledges that climate action will be a cornerstone of our plan to support and create a million jobs across our country. We need great action, from the retrofits announced in the throne speech to the clean vehicle supports announced in the throne speech, and so much more, to make sure we get to net zero by 2050, have stronger science-based 2030 targets and ensure we have effective climate accountability legislation to set five-year carbon targets and turn those long-term targets into short-term practical actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273066">Ninth, infectious diseases represent an incredible threat to our collective well-being, and we need to be proactive in order to prevent the next pandemic. I would argue the Public Health Agency's Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response should issue a public assessment of how Canadian activities, domestic and abroad, contribute to pandemic risk and then tell us how we can take steps to reduce those risks. I had the luck to speak to Dr. Jane Goodall recently, and she made it very clear that this pandemic is at least in part a result of the way we have disrespected our planet and animals. We need to reconsider and reset how we treat both our planet and animals as this relates to pandemic risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273067">Lastly, the pandemic is not over and there will be more lessons to learn. This summer obviously offered us a reprieve, but as the cold weather sets in and we move increasingly indoors, we need to maintain our bubbles strictly, as much as we reasonably can. We need to keep physical distancing with others and wear masks when distancing is not possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273068">I want to close by thanking every single person in our community who, through the Michael Garron community campaign, has sewn and helped distribute masks. Our office alone distributed 10,000 cloth masks in our community. I want to thank everyone for those efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273069">The federal government will continue to be there, in partnership with Canadian families and the provinces, to make sure we get through this pandemic, not only to address the economic crisis, but also to address the health crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273071">That begs the question of what the prorogation was all about about. Was it truly necessary to prorogue? The timing of the prorogation was very suspect, as it followed right on the heels of a large document dump. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273074">However, I also want to respond to the member's suggestion that there was nothing new in the throne speech. Obviously, there are many emergency supports in this throne speech, through EI extensions, to help Canadians in need with income supports and the extension of the wage subsidy for businesses, but we also saw renewed and new commitments to child care, rapid testing, national standards in nursing homes, and ending chronic homelessness. The scale of ambition has also been seriously ramped up when it comes to climate action and reconciliation. I would also be remiss not to note that in the throne speech our federal government seriously answered the concern of the high unemployment rate with a plan to create one million jobs.</ParaText>

Obviously we are not going to see large scale in-person events, for example, so the throne speech did commit to sector-specific support for industries that are more deeply affected by the pandemic.

              <ParaText id="6273082">Madam Speaker, do not let my working from home and the technology suggest that there is any lack of enthusiasm for what we saw in the throne speech. I had enthusiasm for the 2019 throne speech as well, and as I say, we see a mixture of commitments. Of course we want to carry through with gun control and pharmacare and other commitments from 2019. Of course we want renewed commitments and faster action on all sorts of things, including on climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273083"> I will end by speaking on climate specifically, which I know we share a concern for. Since 2015 we have seen the projected 2030 emissions go from 815 megatonnes down to 592 megatonnes, a 25% reduction, because of the climate action policies we put in place. So long as they hold, and so long as we do not have a Conservative government heading into the future, we will absolutely build on those efforts. I am absolutely committed to doing so. I know the federal government is committed to doing so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273084">I am not only enthusiastic about those commitments, but also in delivering on those commitments. The work ahead in a fiscal update, the budget and more will be far more critical than the throne speech. Delivery is what matters.</ParaText>

Under the current circumstances, I had wished that I would be welcoming it with relief, but unfortunately, this speech is a collection of previous speeches. It is a leftover potluck of previous Liberal promises that they never delivered on, which leaves me very skeptical regarding Canada's post-Covid recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273089">It is absolutely shameful and unacceptable to have prorogued Parliament for six weeks, only to come back with a speech so ill-suited to the health crisis affecting our country from coast to coast to coast.

              <ParaText id="6273090">We know Canadians have been in dire need of support. Folks need to be supported for many months to come, and we, in the opposition, have been recognizing this necessity. However, to ensure the government's future spending is done correctly, it is incumbent upon parliamentarians to ask the government some tough and important questions before it injects substantial sums of money into programs.</ParaText>

This is even more the case today, as the cases in the Atlantic bubble are still close to zero, unlike here in Ontario and Quebec.

              <ParaText id="6273097">Where is the Prime Minister's real leadership? When it comes to testing, the government made the announcement yesterday that it will be two to six weeks, or even longer, before Canadians have access to the new testing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273098">Back home in West Nova, the heart of our local economy is generated by tourism and the fishing industry.

I did my part in supporting them and making the hidden gems of West Nova known to a wider audience. We have a beautiful riding, from the Acadian shores of Clare and Argyle to the mountains and farms of the Annapolis Valley. It was very apparent that they feel completely forgotten by the government, because, for one reason or another, they could not qualify for any of the business programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273104">Several elements in the throne speech are, as was mentioned earlier, recycled broken promises, such as high-speed internet access in rural areas like West Nova, the modernization of the Official Languages Act and reconciliation with our first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273105">The promises related to reconciliation with first nations have been talked about by the government since 2015, and they are now seen as a bit of a joke. I find it distressing that the Liberals continue to use the promise of reconciliation with indigenous peoples so lightly. It is a real and serious issue, but the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> opportunistically uses it only when he is in trouble and needs to shine up his image. It is sad to see the failures of his promises to the first nations, such as the response to the report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and last spring's blockade crisis with the Wet'suwet'en.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273106">The best example of this failure is the lobster fishery crisis that has been going for almost a month in my riding. That crisis has been foreseeable for months, almost a year now. The <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation>, with her hands-off approach to the crisis, preferred to ignore all the warning signs, believing that the dispute between commercial fishermen and the Mi'kmaq was going to settle itself, just like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thought that a budget would balance itself. However, neither will happen as long as the Liberal government is in office. All of the catastrophic situations that the government causes and ignores will only get worse, and this is causing suffering that can be avoided for many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273107">For weeks now, tensions between these two groups have been at their peak. Public safety is at stake, both on the sea and on the wharves. Protests are still being planned, with no clear and equitable deal for either party. Weeks ago, the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister</Affiliation> and I engaged in a dialogue in which we agreed that we needed to work together to solve the issue in a reasonable time, and by considering both parties' interests. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273108">This situation is a perfect example of how I, as a Conservative, wanted to work with the government, and we could have worked together, but I am still waiting for the regular follow-up and fair closure that the Minister was to provide to me. It is completely unacceptable that the Minister says that she is having discussions with the two groups of fishermen, while the commercial fishermen are still trying to make themselves heard. The Minister has been telling us for weeks that progress is being made, but it is clearly not happening in St. Mary's Bay. She should be ashamed of her lack of leadership and her failure to deal with this urgent situation diligently, as a minister should be doing. It is a time-sensitive situation, and she must act immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273109">How can we have lasting reconciliation with our indigenous peoples when the government's mismanagement has set these two peaceful groups against each other, jeopardizing the possibility of reconciliation for another generation?

As a former firefighter in 2003, I recall the SARS crisis and the anxiety that was felt by myself and others who I worked with in the paramedic and police services in dealing with that crisis. That anxiety was heightened by the fact that we did not know if we would get the virus and take it home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273132">Six weeks ago, the government prorogued Parliament. At the time, we were at the height of a scandal that was becoming more emboldened as new information became available. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that the reason why he would prorogue Parliament was to come up with a bold and ambitious new course for the country. I would suggest that the ambition was on the part of the Prime Minister to save his political skin at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273133">Members will recall that the government was becoming more embroiled in the scandal. More information was becoming available.

Therefore, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government simply decided to prorogue Parliament so they could make it go away. It is not going away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273134">Let us look at the Prime Minister's bold and ambitious plan. If any of us looked back to the 2015 election platform of the Liberal Party, “Real Change”, we would see that much of what was promised back then was recycled or rehashed in this throne speech. Many of us will recall that at the beginning of the current government, in 2015, Liberals were big on “deliverology”, but we have seen very little in that regard, except for this rehashing and recycling of promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273135">At the beginning of this crisis, all of us were working together in a team Canada approach. I said this the other night when I spoke to Bill <Document DbId="10867435" Type="3">C-4</Document>. Many MPs were on the front lines. We became the front line voice of the government, because in many cases Service Canada offices were closing. People were calling our offices because they were anxious. The level of anxiety was heightened as a result of the fear, the unknown and the uncertainty of what was going to happen next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273136">All of us worked together. Many programs that were announced initially became woefully inadequate, and were found to be that. The Canada emergency wage subsidy, for example, started off at 10%. If it was not for the opposition, all opposition parties, and I am sure the government heard about it as well from business, then that wage subsidy would not have been brought up to the level it was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273137"> There were problems with the CERB. People were falling through the gaps. Maternity benefits is an example of where people were falling through the gaps on CERB. It was the same with the CEBA, the Canada emergency business account. A lot of businesses did not qualify for that benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273138">We all parliamentarians worked together to ensure that these programs were in place. Of course, they were meant to be temporary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273139">Now as we enter into a new wave of COVID-19, clearly we as parliamentarians and the government need to be there to help Canadians. However, we need to be there in recovery as well, not so much as an issue of dependence on the government but to create a recovery plan. What I fail to see in the throne speech is that recovery plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273140">What does recovery look like?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273141"> We have to ensure the government gets out of the way of recovery and allow the power of the free market, allow the power of Canadian businesses, the people they employ and the products they produce to do that. It comes in every sector of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273142">The other thing we did not see in the throne speech was any sense of investor confidence in those sectors of our economy that have been decimated as a result of government policy, legislation and regulation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273143">Clearly the natural resources sector has been impacted has been impacted as a result of the government. We hear many stories of Alberta being on its knees as a result of the legislation, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, regulation and taxation policies that have been imposed on the sector. We want to ensure we move from dependance to recovery, and there was very little in the throne speech that spoke to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273144">With respect to recovery, the other area we really need to focus on is the issue of rapid testing. I find it curious that just yesterday the government approved a rapid test for which an application had been filed with Health Canada just 24 hours before. It is amazing how rapidly the government and Health Canada will move when there is a tremendous amount of anxiety on the part of Canadians who are standing in line for COVID-19 testing. The fact is that rapid testing has been around in other countries. Twelve countries around the world have approved rapid testing, many of them our allies. We have trade pacts and trade agreements with them. Many rapid tests have been put in front of Health Canada, so why the delay? Why the delay that further causes problems for Canadian families that have to wait in line for testing and then for the results?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273145"> Rapid testing is going to become critical for us in out recovery. I was glad to see the rapid test approved, but the government needs to do more to ensure that it is there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273146">The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said that the longer the spending plan goes on it will become unsustainable: $343 billion in deficits, approaching $1.2 trillion in debt. That is on the expenditure side of the ledger. We will need to ensure that we create revenue to pay for these types of programs. We have to allow the power, as I said earlier, of the Canadian economy to do that through less legislation, less regulation, fewer policies, less taxation and create investor confidence that will provide us with the revenue we need to pay for those programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273147">October 1 is a troubling day for many businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises. Rents are due today, yet the commercial emergency rent assistance program that business owners have relied on, though not many of them because it is a deeply flawed program, will cause those business owners problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273148">The last thing I want to talk about are veterans. In its boldness and ambitiousness, the one thing that was neglected in the throne speech were veterans. Not one word of veteran was in the throne speech. Earlier this week, we heard from the Parliamentary Budget Officer about case loads approaching 50,000 that had to be adjudicated and they had yet to be processed. That means 50,000 veterans and their families are living with additional anxiety. I would hope the government would announce a plan to help fix that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273149"> Two years ago the NDP suggested a plan to help alleviate some of those backlogs, and we supported it. The government needs to ensure that is fixed. As shadow minister for Veterans Affairs, I will do everything I can to hold the government to account to have those backlogs fixed.</ParaText>

However, I can tell members that I much prefer to take advice from Health Canada than from a politician when it comes to my medical advice and telling me when a test is ready. I know that this member and other members have talked about other countries and rapid testing, but we have our own independent health agency to advise us on best practices within our own autonomous borders. I would add that my wife spent five hours in line waiting for a test just two days ago here in Kingston, and she as well would much rather know that her test, if it is a rapid test, is one that is approved by Health Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273151">My question to the member is quite blunt, and I had asked it to another Conservative member who really just did not answer it. If he were the Minister of Health, would he have approved a rapid test without the advice of Health Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273164">There has been a lot of talk about the work of this clinic on ensuring New Brunswickers have access to abortion services. What has flown under the radar is that Clinic 554 is also a centre of excellence for trans health care in a province where there is still a lot of stigma. Many of the same people who have been vulnerable to the human rights abuses of conversion therapy have experienced the life-saving compassion and validation that Dr. Edgar, Valerya and the whole team at Clinic 554 provide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273165">Clinic 554 saves lives and it is closing because the province will not rescind regulation 84-20 of the New Brunswick Medical Services Payment Act, in direct contravention of the Canada Health Act, nor will it recognize that trans health care is a subspecialty in medicine that deserves compensation commensurate with the service.</ParaText>

This regulation withholds medicare coverage from abortions performed in community-based clinics, and it has repeatedly been found by Health Canada to constitute a clear violation of the Canada Health Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273168">The closure of Clinic 554 as a result of this policy also constitutes a clear and unjustifiable infringement on the charter rights of women and LGBTQ2IA+ people in the province. This is completely unacceptable.

This government has long advocated for the permanent protection of the herd's habitat, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We have made strides to protect this herd through the establishment of important habitat areas, including two national parks, Ivvavik and Vuntut. We have and we will work together with our indigenous and territorial partners to protect this iconic species.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273442">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> alleges that the government is in contempt of Parliament because it did not respect the order from the Standing Committee on Finance. He said that on July 7, 2020, during the previous session, the committee adopted an order requiring the government to produce documents and that any redaction in these documents be done by the Office of the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel based on the guidelines set out in the order. The member claims that the documents were apparently redacted by departments before being sent to the committee. As evidence, the member cited correspondence addressed to the committee from the law clerk.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273443"> The member for Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes also argued that the government tarnished the reputation and dignity of the law clerk by publicly stating that it was he who had redacted the documents, as specified in the committee’s order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273444">The member said that exceptional circumstances justified the Chair’s ruling on this matter despite the absence of a report from the Standing Committee on Finance, given that the committee had not yet been constituted at the beginning of this parliamentary session. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273445">The <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> responded that the government respected the motion from the Standing Committee on Finance and provided exactly the information requested, on time. He explained that the only things excluded were matters of cabinet confidence and national security, as required by the motion and by statute. The parliamentary secretary added that the committee can meet to transact business as of next week and that, in the absence of a report from the committee, it would be difficult for the Speaker to make a determination as to whether the committee's order was respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273446">After the member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> brought this matter to my attention, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252770" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation>, as well as the parliamentary secretary, made subsequent interventions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273447">In explaining this ruling, it is important to understand the sequence of events that led to the question before the Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273448">On July 7, the Standing Committee on Finance adopted a motion ordering the government to produce certain papers related to We Charity and Me to We, by no later than August 8. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273450">In a letter dated August 18 to the committee clerk, the law clerk explained that his office had redacted from the documents information related to the public servants involved in the matter. The same letter also mentioned that additional redactions had been made by government departments to protect cabinet confidence and other information covered by the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act. The letter noted that certain redactions had been made by the departments on grounds not contemplated by the committee's order and that it was for the committee to determine if it was satisfied with the redactions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273451">The redacted documents were released to committee members on August 18, the same day that Parliament was prorogued. As a consequence, the committee could not sit and could not review the documents or report to the House.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273452">As of today, it is not possible to know whether the committee is satisfied with these documents as provided to it. The new session is now under way. The committee, which has control over the interpretation of its order, has an opportunity to examine the documents and decide what to do with them. On September 23, the House adopted an order setting out a specific procedure to re-establish committees, including the Standing Committee on Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273453">Given these facts and circumstances, it is my view that this is a matter for the committee to consider. If it believes that its privileges have been breached or has any other concern with respect to the situation, it can report to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273454">For these reasons, the Chair cannot find that there is a prima facie question of privilege.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273457">During his intervention, the member argued that the details of the government's response with respect to written question no. 443 are not consistent with information published in an article by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. The member also explained that he had received clarifications from the National Capital Commission regarding the differences between the responses to the written question and those provided to the federation. He felt that these clarifications show “wilful muddying of language” on the government's part. In his opinion, “the government, by the very act of attempting to portray these two requests as different, has shown an attempt to deliberately mislead the House with its written response and is therefore in contempt of the House.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273458">In response, the <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> argued that the information obtained by the member and by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation covers different periods. The parliamentary secretary also suggested that the figures obtained were misread and miscalculated. The parliamentary secretary feels that this is a dispute over facts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273459">In his intervention, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> rightfully mentioned the three criteria used to determine that the House has been deliberately misled, the first being to determine whether a statement made in the House is, in fact, misleading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273460">With regard to written questions, the simple fact that the Speaker must rule on whether the response is misleading de facto comes back to a decision on the content of the response. And yet, the Speaker is not able to rule on the accuracy of the government’s response to questions, oral or written.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273461">We have numerous precedents on this matter. The third edition of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, at page 529, could not be clearer, when it states: “There are no provisions in the rules for the Speaker to review government responses to questions.”</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6273465">Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I thought of you when I was preparing the notes for my speech, because I am sure that when you ran for politics for the first time, it was to serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273466">I think everyone in the House is here to serve, according to their values and their convictions, and with an openness to doubt, which is always a very healthy intellectual experience. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273467">One of my convictions, perhaps the most important one in politics, is a people's right to self-determination. A nation is better at serving itself. A nation is better at serving its seniors. A nation is better at serving its business owners, farmers, artists, fishers, students, environment and researchers. It also holds all the power. It has the characteristics of sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273468">I think that a people starts out sovereign. It then chooses what it will do with that sovereignty: only more power for some, but all the power for others. That is true if the nation is not deprived of its rights. Since today is October 1, my thoughts go out to our Catalan friends, who were denied their independence three years ago today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273469">Canada is not the worst country in the world. Quebec is not yet a country, and it would not be the best of countries, but it would be ours. I am confident that the day after a positive vote by Quebecers, if not the same evening or even within a few minutes, Ottawa would call Quebec City and ask to stay friends. Of course, Quebec City would say yes, because we would stay close. In the meantime, since Quebec is not a country today, we are doing the best we can in the system we are stuck with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273470">I assume that that is what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is doing. Clearly we do not serve the same masters. What divides us is also quite clear: interference in the health care sector at the expense of Quebec and the provinces; marked differences in support to seniors, with the government suddenly deciding to start discriminating based on age; the claim of a green stimulus package, which, when we look closely, actually contains support for the oil industry in the west; and broken promises to farmers. There are many other examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273471">The Bloc Québécois went through its own process. It developed a truly green recovery plan. It toured Quebec, first virtually, then in person. What we put forward, and anyone can check this for themselves, is much clearer and more precise than the government's throne speech. What is in our plan is what Quebeckers chose. This was not a partisan exercise. Our goal is not to suggest that the people who participated in the process support the Bloc Québécois. Now the Bloc is taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273472">In a way, this is the Bloc Québécois's own inaugural speech, a speech for our own republic, which would not displease us. We recognize that we are an opposition party. We make proposals. If Quebec listens to them and supports them, they will be very hard to ignore. It will be hard to start ignoring Quebec again, to ignore our only national parliament, the National Assembly of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273473">Our proposal and the throne speech differ in many respects. There are intrinsic differences, of course. There is the fact that the Bloc Québécois does not believe in the monarchy—more on that later. There is the fact that we condemn the government's decision to prorogue as well as its throne speech and solemn message to the nation, neither of which contained anything of substance. We deplore the Prime Minister's heritage, which is one of centralization. We deplore Canada's love for John A. Macdonald at a time when we condemn racism on a daily basis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273474">We condemn the colonial legacy. After all, the conquest remains unfinished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273475">The provinces asked for an increase to health transfers to bring the total federal share of health care funding to 35%. No one, not in Quebec or in the provinces, asked for the federal government to interfere. The government arrogantly responded that it was better than the provinces, that Quebec is just Quebec and the provinces are just the provinces. Canada claims to be better than us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273476">Can anyone name one thing that a Canadian can do that a Quebecker cannot? The federal government just has more money because of its Constitution, which, after all, is a legacy. Canada can cut the transfers. Canada is richer because of our own money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273477">The government has mentioned sending in the army. October 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of the October crisis. Canada in 1970, the Canada of the then Prime Minister, sent in the army, claiming an insurrection to overturn, they said, the Government of Quebec. It was a mighty insurrection of fewer than 40 militants.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273478">I am against all forms of violence. We are against all forms of violence. The imprisonment of 500 Quebeckers was violent. The questioning of thousands of others was violent. I am waiting for the condemnation of that violence too. Where are the apologies to the 500 Quebec families?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273479">No one is asking for an apology to the FLQ cells, not even the son of Paul Rose, Félix, who is a very talented filmmaker and does Quebec proud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273480">The FLQ cells were merely a pretext. We are demanding an apology for the Prime Minister of Canada's decision to temporarily turn Quebec into a military state. You cannot imagine how proud the 32 sovereignist members are to rise in the Parliament of Canada 50 years after the October Crisis, during which a large element meant to suppress us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273481">Where are the apologies to the Acadians who were deported? Where are the apologies to Louis Riel and the Métis, while John A. Macdonald continues to be celebrated? Among whited sepulchres, apologies are reserved for non-francophones. After all, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> runs Her Majesty's government, and the conquest is not yet complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273482">This modern style of colonialism can take many forms. Quebec wants to increase the use of French at work. The Liberals claim to do better, but their version of better is to set the French language back. Quebec wants to make federally regulated businesses subject to Bill 101. I challenge the government to refrain from opposing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273483">Quebec is demanding that the federal government respect its jurisdictions. The NDP is not Quebec. The Conservatives are not Quebec. The Bloc Québécois is not Quebec. Only Quebec can speak for Quebec. Bloc members have no other allegiance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273484"> The Bloc Québécois moved an amendment calling for the government to respect Quebec's jurisdiction over health care, to increase health transfers and to improve the lives of our seniors. After publicly saying they would support it—or at least they did in French—the NDP and the Conservatives voted against the Bloc Québécois's amendment. All those who voted against the amendment should do some soul searching.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273485">I urge the government to tread very carefully before continuing to challenge Quebec. I cannot keep from mentioning the inevitable, the unavoidable and the shameful. I want to believe that Parliament is ashamed of what Canada's indigenous peoples are going through. We have to tell ourselves that, when it comes to the first nations, which are nations, we are one Parliament. The Prime Minister of Canada speaks for all those who are represented by this Parliament. For the time being, we should be ashamed to even face the first nations, especially this week and today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273486">I warn the government not to give in to the temptation to take away our privileges again with the help of the NDP, a party in trouble, and once again shut down Parliament. The NDP has chosen uncertain friends and allies in order to stay alive. The Bloc Québécois will vote against the Speech from the Throne. If this Parliament has any courage, the days of the current government are numbered. If some of us had courage, the hours of this government would be numbered.</ParaText>

It is the right of a people, of a nation, to define itself. It is up to a nation to state that it is a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273497">There are about 300 Naskapi individuals in northern Quebec. They are a nation, just as the 8.4 million Quebeckers are a nation. A nation defines itself. All nations have the right to self-determination. However, in truth, very few of them want that in its entirety. Among all existing nations that are part of a subgroup in a great many countries, I do not know which ones want to be completely independent before establishing alliances by treaty with their counterparts. The European Union is a perfect example, and an encouraging one in some regards. Some only want more powers. The Bretons want to protect their language as do the Corsicans. Self-determination is not the obligation to have independence, it is the right to independence.</ParaText>

In this case, we worked together, and we figured that a quick and effective course of action, familiar to businesses and their accountants, would be a tax credit on fixed costs with a limit on spending. All types of fixed costs would be eligible. The tax credit would be broad and could be adjusted to the type of activity and the temporary loss of economic activity specific to each business. It would be part of the federal tax system, and therefore entirely legitimate. I think that is the direction we must go in.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273518">I stand here today to talk about the Speech from the Throne and COVID-19, but with a focus on my riding, which is very much connected to the United States and exemplifies some of the challenges our families face with respect to reunification across the globe. Obviously, in Windsor West, before COVID we had an extensive relationship with the United States. That still goes on today, but it is now a little awkward, different and more difficult than ever before. Prior to COVID-19, the area I represent, which is three-fifths of the city of Windsor, had over 40,000 vehicles per day that crossed into the United States, 10,000 trucks and about 30,000 vehicles with family members and friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273519">There are all kinds of different relationships, from the professional level to the relationship level that families experience on a regular basis. In fact, we are proud of that. In Windsor, Ontario, when we have our Remembrance Day ceremony, we include the <I>Star-Spangled Banner</I> as part of what we sing because we are not only very proud Canadians but also not afraid to express our relationship with our cousins in the United States, and other places in the world, as part of our culture. In fact, we are the fourth most-diverse community in all of Canada. We have over 100 ethnocultural-related organizations that are registered and have been working in Windsor for a number of decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273520">With COVID-19, we have seen families torn apart. We have seen people unable to be united. We have had a lot of challenges. I want to thank the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> for talking with me about this as we entered into COVID before the House shut down. I raised the difficulties we face because there are up to 2,000 people who commute across our border as front-line workers, supporting the efforts to fight COVID in the United States. There are doctors, nurses, PSWs—I am a PSW myself—who go over to the United States daily and we have to keep them safe and secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273521">The problem we are faced with is this. As COVID has continued to hamper our economy, it has also created challenges for individuals who have loved ones across this globe. Whether it be as simple as in Detroit, Michigan, across from Windsor, or in England or some other commonwealth nation, or even farther than that. The government's response has been nothing short of irresponsible on this. There has been nothing but delay, and it continues to push the issue down the road without any type of support for individuals. That hurts not only the families but I would argue our economy. More importantly it hurts our entire community, our neighbours, all the people in our communities, because we have people who are in limbo. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273522">I guess I take this a little personally in the sense that my aunt married an American. I have representatives of entire populations across Windsor and Essex County who are connected to people from everywhere, from Lebanon to Pakistan to India to China and other places, and there has been no recourse or any supports provided to individuals to work through the COVID issue and provide safety and security in family reunification. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273523">What we are talking about is this. The government's narrow definition of what constitutes a family has prevented that and is flying in the face of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It has identified direct relatives using an amazingly old and outdated system that does not even take into account the real relationships taking place right now. This affects people from a mental health aspect. It also affects people with respect to connecting, family planning and so forth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273524">My appeal to the government is for the issue be taken responsibly and moved forward. We have presented several plans to the government. I come from a community that is on the front lines. I started this speech by talking about how many vehicles and people traverse back and forth on a regular basis. We are just as concerned as anyone out there with respect to the spreading of COVID and having the system in the United States impact our community, but it does not take away from our determination to reunite families that need to have a process in place and the necessary supports from the government. </ParaText>

I believe, again, that it is not just about the individual families who do not have a connection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273530">I look to Windsor where we have the Costello family. People need to understand how draconian the system is. This is in Windsor where they asked to go to hospice to visit a dying mother, Diane. She has passed away, and my go condolences to the Costello family today. I thank all their family for fighting for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273531"> They did not have to stop anywhere. They were going from the border eight kilometres to a hospice, and it was originally denied by the government. There would be no interaction anywhere else. Meanwhile, we can drive across British Columbia to Alaska and then head into Alaska and come back, stopping several places, and that is okay, but they could not get permission. We finally did get it, and I thank the government for allowing permission for the family to be together for her dying days, but this should not be a fight. This should be a planning process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273532"> The government needs to wake up to it and acknowledge that this could go on for a long period of time. COVID-19 is going to continue to plague us as citizens, but we cannot fall into always saying no and not doing the hard work necessary to reunite families, whether they be loved ones, fiancés, brothers or sisters. All those types of relationships that are out there, that are connected, can be scrutinized. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273533">There has been a tremendous amount of work done, so nobody is asking for somebody to come willy-nilly into this country and get a free pass. They are actually putting forward their families' high expectations, ensuring coverage, ensuring a plan, ensuring there is going to be follow through and quarantining, all those things. Right now, the government is just saying no, a blanket no. That is not acceptable because this is going to continue to go on. This hurts not only the people directly involved but also our entire community. That is what I am trying to impress upon the system right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273534">We saw the one case I referenced, the Costello family. At that time, I pointed out that a billionaire got into this country, to Toronto, and got through the system. The government's response was to blame CBSA. That is not acceptable. It is not acceptable for our workers to be put on that mantle and have it said that they are the problem. The CBSA workers are actually our front-line heroes. They deal every day with people coming back and forth on the land border, and they also deal with the air and other things. They need direction and support from the government. They just cannot be doing it by themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273535">What we are calling for is a fully accountable process that has been presented to the government. The government is potentially responding now, because it is feeling the pressure. It should not be political pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273536">One case is enough, and it is not acceptable for us to continue to put people in pain by their not knowing their future. It is not good for mental health. It is not good for the workforce. It is not good for the families. All of those are reasons why we can do better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273537">That is where we are at. We cannot change the past right now. We cannot undo the damage that has been done. What we can do is bring in a fully accountable, credible process for families to be reunited that ensures safety for the public. Surely we can do that. We have to do better. COVID-19 may not be going away for a long period of time. We have direct testing now available. The time has come for us to change, for the government to change, and to reunite families.</ParaText>

It is trying to push this issue and say we are against public health because we want families to be reunited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273553">However, it is the exact opposite, and the parliamentary secretary knows that. His government knows that. The issues that we have brought forward are to protect people, protect the public and reunite families in an accountable way, even more so than what he and his government are allowing, which is for people to get in their car and drive all the way to Alaska, with no accountability.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6273556">Madam Speaker, I am very proud to be participating in this debate from a town in northern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273557">COVID-19 plunged Canada into the worst economic and medical crisis in a hundred years. The pandemic disrupted our economy and jeopardized the future of millions of workers. It is essential that Parliament show leadership in this crisis. We need to work together and invest the necessary funds to help our country get through the pandemic safely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273558">I am very proud to be participating in this debate today and to be discussing the situation in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273559">It is really crucial when we are talking about the Speech from the Throne and where we need to go that we frame our role in terms of us being in the worst medical and economic catastrophe in a century. I am on the phone all day with people who are really frightened, and I know that members of every party are as well. People are frightened by the rising numbers of COVID cases. People are still dealing with the catastrophe of long-term care homes, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, and worrying about their aged loved ones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273560">We need to be putting people front and centre, and we can do this. We can have a very spirited and at times confrontational Parliament, but the focus is to get the services out there and what the best ways to get them out there are. It is one of the reasons the New Democratic party fought so hard to change the CERB, which the Liberal government was going to drop to $1,600 a month. We said that would leave over a million Canadians, such as gig workers and contract workers, in a very precarious situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273561">This has forced a discussion about the problems of an economic system that for years was dependent on keeping people in contract positions, part-time work and precarious positions in the gig economy. When COVID hit, two million people were not able to pay their rents within two weeks of the lockdown, and we have to change that. Our focus right now has to be getting people through the long winter ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273562">The Speech from the Throne reads like an NDP platform. It reads like everything the NDP has been running on for years. The problem is the Liberals always run on the NDP platform; they just never govern from it. I was a young man with little children when the Liberals started promising child care. I am glad they are promising it again, but will we see it? I am glad the Liberals are promising pharmacare, but they have promised it in many forms and never delivered it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273563">However, this is a minority government. This is our opportunity to put forward negotiations to make things happen, and there is a will right now to move Canada forward to a new normal. It is going to take an enormous investment from the federal government to get this nation through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273564">I want to speak to two issues. One is very concerning, and one may be very positive for my region in the north. In the midst of the pandemic, we are dealing with the other great pandemic: the opioid crisis. It has been a disaster. I am talking to people in North Bay, Sudbury and Kirkland Lake about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273565">Timmins has been hit very hard. Mixed in with the opioid crisis is the homelessness crisis, with upwards of sometimes over a thousand people who are homeless in the Timmins region, a community of 44,000. I congratulate our mayor George Pirie, the people who work at the DSSAB, the mental health workers, the police and those at Living Space in Timmins. They have done an amazing job trying to keep people safe and housed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273566">I have noticed that the Liberal government has quietly let many of the programs that could have helped die over the last year. A lot of the monies that should have been there for the opioid crisis are not there. There have been great promises for money for homelessness, but the money dried up very quickly. We are hearing positive language from the government, but when will that money be delivered? This winter is going to be a very hard winter in Canada, and I am very concerned about the opioid crisis and the homelessness crisis in our communities in northern Ontario. This is something that is non-partisan. Every single community in the country is facing this disastrous crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273567">We have to be ready to work together to get through this, but that means the Liberal government has to move on from positive words. They think if they say positive words, they get positive results, but that is not how it works. Positive words mean action. Action means we have to get the money out now to address the opioid and homelessness crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273568">I was very pleased to hear in the Speech from the Throne the commitment on electric cars. That is certainly something that will help manufacturing in southern Ontario. If we are going to talk about a green recovery through a sustainability lens, we have to be saying that, if we are going to put federal investment into these plants, the sources of the raw materials need to have a green lens too. The products that are mined have to have indigenous agreements and they need to move toward sustainability. That will give an enormous advantage to Canada, rather than taking nickel from Indonesia or going to the war zones of Congo for copper and cobalt. We need to say we are going to insist on an environmentally sustainable and indigenous positive resource policy to help manufacture electric vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273569">We may have a massive new nickel mine in the Timmins region, and they have already come out front saying they want a whole environmental plan to get to zero emissions. We have the Borden mine in northern Ontario, which is working with zero emissions. They have removed the diesel machines from underground and are going completely electric.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273570">In my community of Cobalt, we have the first cobalt refinery being set up. Cobalt is essential. There is no clean energy future without cobalt, but right now the majority of the world's sources are coming from Congo, which has a horrific record of human rights abuses, child labour and environmental degradation. This also puts us into a geopolitical war with China for who is going to control the cobalt resources and the future of the digital economy. We have an opportunity in Canada to turn that around and say we can do it in an environmentally sustainable way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273571"> One of the things that has to come out of the pandemic is a real discussion about when and how are we actually going to start meeting our targets and meeting an environmentally sustainable future so that we are making investments and creating the jobs that are important here. This is something we need to be doing now, because the government is making the investments to get us through the pandemic, but this has to be for a long-term vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273572">At the end of the day, our focus right now is about working people who have been completely up-ended by the crisis, including people I know who were in the gig economy and people who worked in the service sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273573">I am very, very concerned about the rising numbers of COVID and going into new lockdowns. We see Quebec just moved into the red zone. If restaurants start to close, many of them will not reopen. That is the reality. We need to be addressing the potential economic catastrophe if we do not get the numbers in check.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273574">For this, the federal government can play a huge role. This is why the NDP pushed for sick leave benefits, something that allows less protected workers to actually be able to take time off, so we can lessen the COVID numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273575">We did something historic this week in putting workers first and making those fundamental changes. I know we stayed up until three in the morning, but I want to say how proud I was that the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives supported the New Democratic Party's efforts and we voted unanimously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273576">We in the New Democratic Party will continue the tough negotiations to keep the focus on getting people through the pandemic, so people can look to the federal government and say that Canada is doing their part and not giving into to the kind of horrific political chaos we are seeing south of the border. We are also seeing this in other countries that are being plunged into much worse conditions. We need to stay focused at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273577">I thank the Liberals for stealing so many great new ideas from the New Democrats in the Speech from the Throne. I am going to make their lives a living hell, at times, to make sure they live up to those ideas. That is my job as a member in the honourable opposition, but I think we can come out of this Parliament with something better for Canadians and a reason to believe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273582">I encourage the Liberal government to stand up for our industries, stand up for agriculture and make sure that the trade policies are not punitive, because we can compete.

              <ParaText id="6273593">I am pleased to provide an address on the 150th Speech from the Throne today to MPs in the House of Commons, those participating virtually, the Canadian people and in particular my fantastic constituents watching in the great riding of Sault Ste. Marie. It is located in the centre of Canada at the heart of the Great Lakes, on the border of the United States, in the traditional territory of the Ojibwa people of Garden River and Batchawana, as well as of the Métis people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273594">I want to begin by recognizing and thanking our front-line and essential workers who are looking after our health and safety, putting food on our tables and making sure our economy's supply chains continue to operate. This includes my wife, Lisa, who is a health care worker, so thanks to my wife as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273595">This is my first time to address the House virtually. I would also like to thank my staff who have been working with me around the clock, seven days a week, looking after the good people of the Soo during these unprecedented times. I also want to give a shout out to all my family, friends and supporters who have been supporting me as I work to help Canadians. They are my rock. They are my everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273596">To overcome the significant challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic poses for all of us, we need all levels of government, every sector of our economy and indeed every Canadian to act in solidarity and work together. We have been in lockstep in our fight against COVID-19 in the Soo since the beginning. The people of Sault Ste. Marie have been unwavering in their commitment to each other and looking out for their families, friends and neighbours. It has been an honour working with Mayor Provenzano and his council; Chief Sayers, Chief Rickard and their councils; MPs and MPPs from all parties and the Sault Ste. Marie Chamber of Commerce, local labour groups, and various private and public-sector businesses and organizations. #WeAreInThisTogether</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273597">I have been told that our health unit has some of the lowest numbers of COVID cases in Ontario, a testament to that mantra. I am confident that the vigilance and sacrifice of individuals and communities across Canada, coupled with the expertise and diligence of medical professionals working hard on a vaccine and caring for patients, will see Canada through this challenging time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273598">Our approach to beating this pandemic and the impacts it has had on our economy is centred on four pillars that were outlined recently in the Speech from the Throne. First, we are working to protect the health of Canadians, particularly the most vulnerable. To help protect seniors, we will work with parliamentarians on Criminal Code amendments to penalize those who neglect the seniors under their care. We are going to work with provinces and territories to set new national standards for long-term care so that seniors get the best support possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273599">We are going to take additional actions to help people stay in their homes longer. We are also going to increase old age security, once a senior turns age 75, and boost the Canada pension plan survivor benefits. We are going to ensure, as well, that our health care system serves Canadians even better. We are going to ensure that everyone has access to a family doctor or a primary care team, expand capacity of delivery for virtual health care, continue to address the opioid epidemic and further increase access to mental health care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273600">We are going to accelerate to achieve national universal pharmacare through a rare disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high cost drugs, and establish a national formulary to keep drug prices low. Working with the provinces and territories, we will move forward without delay, bringing forward a new disability inclusion plan to help Canadians with disabilities gain access to programs and benefits. This plan is also going to be welcome. We are also building a plan to end chronic homelessness for good in Canada. As such, I was pleased to announce recently two affordable housing initiatives in the Soo, which repurpose two old schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273601"> Our second pillar basically says we have Canadians' backs. That expression seems to have been coined at the gates of Algoma Steel here in Sault Ste. Marie, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was here speaking to steelworkers. We fought really hard against the two American tariffs on steel and aluminum, and won. That was our mantra: We have your back. Now it is a rallying cry for all workers in Canada during these unprecedented times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273602">I was pleased to see a commitment of creating one million jobs in the Speech from the Throne, and we will get there by using a number of tools in our economic toolbox. Extremely important tools in that box are the regional economic development agencies like FedNor, which I proudly serve as parliamentary secretary. From the get-go, our RDAs have been there for communities, businesses and organizations from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273603">We introduced the regional relief and recovery fund, an almost $1 billion fund, to help those who need that extra help. In Northern Ontario that fund was split between FedNor and Community Futures development corporations, and I have been proud to announce a number of supports on behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="253383" Type="96">Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages (FedNor)</Affiliation> that go hand in glove with the funding from the CFDCs. These are supporting communities, small businesses, tourism, agriculture, IT, indigenous, manufacturing and green initiatives all across Northern Ontario, from areas of Kenora, Thunder Bay, Elliot Lake, Sudbury, Timmins, North Bay, Parry Sound and, of course, Sault Ste. Marie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273604">We are going to create direct investments in the social sector and infrastructure, immediately train and skill up workers, and create incentives for employers to hire and retain workers. We are going to extend the Canada emergency wage subsidy through to next summer, so workers can remain on payrolls. We are going to create jobs for young Canadians by significantly scaling up the youth employment strategy. We are strengthening the middle class and will continue building long-term competitiveness with clean growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273605">This is great news for Sault Ste. Marie, as when I was on city council I seconded a resolution declaring us the alternative energy capital of North America. That is why I was very pleased to see that we are launching a new fund to attract investments in making zero-emission products and cutting the corporate tax rate in half for those companies to create jobs and make Canada a world leader in clean technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273606">We are immediately bringing forward a plan to exceed Canada's 2030 climate goals, and we are going to legislate Canada's goals of net-zero emissions by 2050. We are creating thousands of jobs retrofitting homes and buildings, which cuts energy costs for Canadians, families and businesses. We are going to invest in reducing the impact of climate-related disasters like floods and wildfires to make communities safer and more resilient. We are helping deliver more transit and active transit options, and we are going to create a new Canada water agency to keep our water safe, clean and well managed and continue to grow Canada's ocean economy.</ParaText>

Parents are needing to work fewer hours or are quitting their jobs entirely to take care of their kids. That is a challenge. That is why we will be making a significant, long-term, sustained investment to create a Canada-wide early learning and child care system.

From the very beginning, we have worked hard to keep everyone safe and healthy and ensured Canadians had the support they needed to get through this crisis. We immediately took action with historic programs like the CERB and Canada's emergency wage subsidy to help Canadians pay their bills and help businesses keep workers on the payroll.</ParaText>

That might raise eyebrows among those who know a thing or two about Canadian politics. I am thinking, for example, of the $17 billion invested to purchase a pipeline and of the $10 billion in subsidies to the automobile industry in 2008. When the forestry industry fell on hard times, it did not get support from the Canadian government. I am also thinking about the repeated cuts to health care, which weakened Quebec’s health care system. In my opinion, the words of the member for Malpeque are a bit rich.</ParaText>

It is a great privilege for me to rise today and speak of our government's plan to build a stronger and more resilient Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273629">Over the course of this year, we have faced unprecedented new challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was only a little over six months ago that our new reality came crashing into our lives, and yet in that time Canadians have been able to radically retool our economy to help ensure that we can all continue to put food on the table and keep a roof over our heads while still staying safe from COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273630">We can all agree that the world today is drastically different than the one we lived in at the beginning of 2020. The ability of Canadians to not only clearly recognize the threat posed by COVID-19 but also take action at a grassroots level, to mobilize and face it head-on shows how adaptable Canadians are. Benjamin Franklin once said that out of adversity comes opportunity, and we will find that the throne speech embodies this sentiment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273631">While COVID-19 is the greatest challenge our generation has yet faced, it is not the greatest challenge we will face. Climate change is a threat that we have known about for decades. The scientific consensus is clear: We must keep global warming below 1.5 degrees if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and to do that we must take bold action now. We must apply the same decisiveness and determination that we had in the face of a pandemic to climate change, and for that we need a big plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273632">I am very pleased to say that our government has the plan today, and with the help of Canadians across this country we can implement it and build a brighter future for our children, where they no longer live with climate change casting a cloud over their futures. Through policies such as retrofitting homes and other buildings to be more energy-efficient and building new clean energy infrastructure, not only are we investing in protecting our environment, but we are investing in the economy of the future and creating well-paying, middle-class jobs for Canadians when they need them the most. By taking the same all-hands-on-deck approach to climate change that we took for dealing with the pandemic, we can meet our climate goals and build a more prosperous country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273633">Global markets are already recognizing the great opportunity created by climate action. Investors are abandoning fossil fuels in favour of renewables. Businesses and individuals are switching to electric vehicles and Canadians are reducing their energy cost by retrofitting their homes. The World Bank estimated that climate action will create $30 trillion in new investment opportunities by 2030, and we will help Canadians take advantage of that market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273634">We are going to make zero-emissions vehicles more affordable for Canadians and invest in new charging infrastructure so that Canadians coast to coast to coast can reach their destination in electric cars. We do not want Canadians just using zero-emissions vehicles, we want to put them to work in building them here in Canada also. Here in Canada, we have the rich natural resources, like copper and nickel, that are needed for zero-emissions vehicles as well as a skilled workforce who can build them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273635">We are going to create a new fund to attract investment in this technology right here in Canada, and we are going to cut the corporate tax rate in half for those companies that create jobs building clean technology. With these supports, I know that Canada can become a global leader in clean technology, and we will ensure that Canada is the most competitive country in the world for clean technology companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273636">We know that this plan will work because it is already working. Recently, Ford announced that it is investing $1.8 billion to produce new fully battery electric vehicles right here in Canada. Industry is recognizing that the future is green, and we are going to make sure that Canada is there, leading the world in this transition to a green economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273637">Electric vehicles are important in decarbonizing our economy, but in order to truly maximize their potential, we need to ensure that the energy used to fill their batteries is generated from non-emitting and renewable sources. The energy sector will play a key part in our national effort to build a green economy, and the federal government will be there to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273638">Initiatives like the clean power fund will not only help increase our clean energy-generating capacity, but also build the infrastructure to get the energy from where it is produced to where it is consumed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273639">Projects like the Atlantic loop will be key in transporting clean electricity throughout the Atlantic region, and we want to be there to help them do it. Clean energy production is absolutely vital to building a prosperous and sustainable future. We will ensure that Canada is a world leader, not only building it here but exporting the technology around the world. Clean energy is essential for our future, but it alone will not be enough to meet our climate commitments and avert the worst effects of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273640">During this pandemic, Canadians across the country have been reminded of the incredible value of the natural world. Whether they were exploring our rich forests and conservation areas or safely socializing with their friends in public parks, natural areas have provided a great deal of value to those who would otherwise have been stuck inside their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273641">More than just providing a venue for human enjoyment, our natural world is vital to maintaining the health of our planet. Biodiversity loss has been identified as one of the key contributors to the rise of new infectious diseases, like COVID-19. If we are to prevent another disease outbreak like this from happening in the future, it is imperative that we halt the alarming trend of biodiversity loss and extinctions that are rippling throughout Canada and the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273642">That is why we are committed to expanding our protected areas so that a quarter of our land mass and a quarter of our oceans are protected in the next five years. In addition to that, we need to make sure that the natural world is more accessible to Canadians. The federal government will work with municipalities to expand urban parks and create healthier cities where all Canadians will have access to the natural beauty Canada has to offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273643">In doing this, we will be creating good jobs for Canadians while protecting and enhancing these natural areas, including the planting of two billion trees to sequester carbon and create healthy ecosystems. Tree planting alone is projected to create 3,000 new jobs, where Canadians can make a positive change in their environment every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273644"> Creating new parks and expanding our urban forest will have concrete and tangible effects on the livability of our cities, but there is still much more that we can do to make them work for regular Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273645">We will continue to make our investments in public transit projects, like the successful ION light rail in my riding of Kitchener Centre, and expand active transit infrastructure so more people could ride their bikes to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273646">We will help Canadians retrofit their homes and businesses to be more energy efficient, to save on energy costs and to help slash the emissions that come from our built environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273647"> Every single Canadian in our country will have a part to play in our green transition, and every single Canadian will share in the opportunities it creates. Thirty trillion dollars' worth of opportunity is there, waiting to be earned. We want to ensure that Canadians are there to take advantage of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273648">The COVID-19 crisis has already shown us that we have the capacity to turn adversity into opportunity, and now we will show the world that we can apply that same determination and resiliency to the greatest existential crisis of our generation, the threat of irreversible climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273649">As we strive against COVID-19 today, so, too, must we continue to fight for the next generation of Canadians. Rarely in history is a nation called to face a challenge of such immense proportions. Rarely in history is the resiliency and the courage of the people tested in a way that will determine our future.

              <ParaText id="6273665">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise on behalf of the good people of Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola. I plan on sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252876" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273666">Before I begin my comments today, I note that why we are here absolutely cannot be overlooked. At a time when regular Parliament was already adjourned, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wanted to shut down the few parliamentary committees that were meeting. Why did he want to shut them down? It was because the committees heard evidence that clearly did not reconcile with things the Prime Minister and one of his ministers had told Canadians. The cover-up on this continues, which is truly shameful, and here we are with what I view as an absolute embarrassment of a throne speech. However, before I get to that point, let me preface my comments by mentioning what troubles me so greatly about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273667"> He has no moral qualms about looking Canadians in the eye and making promises he has no intention of keeping. The Prime Minister is prepared to promise almost anything he thinks young people want to hear. He does not appear to care about making all kinds of empty promises to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273668">How can we forget his promise to not prorogue Parliament or introduce omnibus budget bills? </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273669">I could spend my entire speech listing the many broken promises of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Sadly, he repackages a Liberal Party greatest hits list of broken promises and recycles them, again and again, into his throne speeches. To me, that is wrong on every level, and I would like to think that it is non-partisan to be so greatly troubled by a leader who has no regard for the value of his word to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273670">Let me provide a small example. In my riding, along with many others in Canada, we are potentially losing our automated 24–hour VHF radio weather warning service. Let us forget that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> boasts that now is not the time for austerity as he looks to cut these services to Canadians. The justification for this proposed cut is that we can get the same information from our smart phones. That might make sense, or at least it is an argument, but unfortunately there is a problem. In my riding, there are still rural communities and recreational areas with no wireless service whatsoever. It is insulting to them to learn of this news, because these rural communities in many cases are the ones that most depend on the VHF weather service because they do not have wireless service. This is despite the fact that for five years now the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been promising to deliver wireless connectivity to rural areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273671">In fact, in this throne speech, this always-broken promise is recycled: “The Government will accelerate the connectivity timelines and ambitions of the Universal Broadband Fund to ensure that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet.” It has been the same failed promise for over five years. Nothing happens. Very few faces change in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s tired cabinet of underperformers. What about the promise to cut cellphone bills by 25%? That did not even make it into the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273672">It is hard to believe that yet another promise to Canadians was not kept. This brings me to another important criticism of the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273673">The members who were in the House in previous Parliaments know that, at the end of the day, there is a limited number of bills that can be passed. That is a reality that all governments have had to accept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273674">Instead of setting a realistic agenda, the government included other promises in the throne speech that it knows full well it cannot keep. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273675">In other words, the throne speech is intentionally drafted in such a way that it has an element of failure built right into it. It is not unlike being at the restaurant Tucker's Marketplace here in Ottawa and loading up a plate with every food choice possible knowing full well there will be more food on the plate than anyone could ever possibly eat. What happens to a person in this scenario? We all know a person who does this. They focus on things that appeal most to them and others will be left behind. In other words, they prioritize what is most important. This is perhaps the greatest failure of the throne speech, because if everything is a priority, nothing is a priority at all, in effect. I am reminded of the classic Liberal leader candidate debate and the words of Stéphane Dion, who famously said, “Do you think it's easy to set priorities?”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273676">The throne speech really took a page from Stéphane Dion's play book, as it really did not target any specific priorities. What we got instead was a real buzzword salad, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s new favourite expression: build back better. What does that really mean?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273677">Austerity is another popular word at the moment. I do not think it means what the Prime Minister claims it means. The problem with this style of throne speech is that it inevitably leads to broken promises. It has only increased cynicism about Canadian politics. Let us not forget that cynicism used to be something the Prime Minister also claimed to care about.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273678">After all, it was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said, “Canadians are tired of the cynicism and mistrust that has characterized federal politics for far too long.” Of course, that was back in 2015. Flash forward to today, and now he drafts throne speeches that he knows full well his legislative agenda cannot and will not accomplish. Why do it? In this case, we know that cover had to be provided for the WE scheme.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273679">Let us step back for a moment. No one made the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promise that he would not prorogue Parliament. No one made him promise not to use omnibus budget bills. The Prime Minister decided on his own to make those promises. This brings to mind his throne speech. The Prime Minister could have written a Speech from the Throne that identified his government's priorities, and those priorities could have been realistically tailored to legislative agendas.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6273680">Instead we get an exceptionally long hodgepodge of “liberology” with no clear priorities. What happened to better is always possible? Why does this throne speech give us so many of the same promises and buzzwords? Canadians need a bold and new vision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273681">We needed new ideas and clear direction on what will be actually accomplished. Even more importantly, we need to know how it will be accomplished. Perhaps these expectations are too high for a throne speech. The Speech from the Throne is considered to be of great importance, but the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> broke his promise to not prorogue Parliament. The Prime Minister set those high expectations himself.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273682">Although I understand that not everyone can publicly agree, I suspect we all know that this throne speech was a failure. It is just a cover for the WE scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273683">I have one other point to make before I close. There is something in the throne speech that I do agree with, as I like to close on a positive. It is a comment from the throne speech: “Canada has the resources—from nickel to copper—needed for these clean technologies. This—combined with Canadian expertise—is Canada’s competitive edge.” On this point, I agree. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273684">It is a refreshing change to see the Liberal government recognize the importance of mining and the natural resources sector to the Canadian economy. How can that truly play a role in the development of new technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273697">Before we talk about extending certain tax treatment, the same that is being done right now with electric vehicles, the government said that for three years, $100 million a year would go toward subsidizing companies that switched to electric car. First, we do not have a business case. The Liberals have spent 80% of that budget in one year. We know the adoption of it is up, but are we taking vehicles off the road or are we giving wealthy Canadian families a third or fourth vehicle to trot around in, while still having other cars burning other sources of fuel? Is there a valid business case? Are we seeing people removing a combustion engine from the road and going to an electric vehicle? We should not just be subsidizing rich people.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273706">It has been a great honour to serve for the past eight months, particularly to represent small businesses, and advocate for better policies to help those small businesses. I and my colleagues have made numerous recommendations to the Liberals. Some they listened to and some they did not. I do appreciate the ones that the government did listen to, because these small businesses certainly needed our help during these challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273707">Small businesses are unique, but when the economy was shut down, only essential businesses were allowed to stay open. It is an interesting term, “essential businesses”, because every small business out there feels like it is essential. These people their blood, sweat and tears into their businesses. To tell them that they are not essential is painful. The very least we can do is try to support them and try to ensure they have a fighting chance to succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273708"> Unfortunately, the good work that we were doing at committee, particularly at the finance committee, was put to a stop. We started to make some progress on a variety of issues. Then we uncovered that the way the government was sending out some of these programs, like the WE program, was full of issues. Unfortunately, that resulted in Parliament being prorogued, which is really damning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273709">As a member of Parliament, I understand that we will have to adapt and change and that obstacles will get in our way in doing this job. COVID-19 is, without a doubt, the most significant issue that a generation will see. It is very important that we craft policies to get us through this. Unfortunately, a lot of the policies we have seen may have helped, but in many areas they have not helped. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273710">The government took six weeks, took a little time out to try to craft a new Speech from the Throne. Unfortunately, it is more like recycled messages. There is a lot to unpack from the Liberal Speech from the Throne, after the Liberals took their hiatus, and I want to highlight a few of the topics they covered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273711">Finally, the Liberals start to talk about health and testing, and rapid testing. We have had six months to get this right and they are still talking about it. Just in the last couple of days, it looks like we might be making some small progress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273712">There is this wild assertion that somehow when the government takes on debt, it is not the debt of the people. It is an amazing comment to make. That debt belongs to the people. There is only one taxpayer. Also, they say “one million jobs”. Frankly, if the government could just get out of the way, get these businesses back operating, they will produce the jobs. Government does not produce the jobs; the private sector produces them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273713">However, the expansion of the CEBA really raises my hair. The government is going to expand something that it has not even fixed. We have been asking the government for months and months to fix the program and allow small businesses that use a personal account to have access to the program. Get it fixed and get it right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273714">Despite all these promises and all the things the Liberals said they were going to do, we would think we would have outstanding performance. Lo and behold, we pretty much have the highest spending among the G7 countries and the highest unemployment. How does that correlate to good programs? That tells me that other countries have got it better than us and we need to adjust. We need to stop the buzzwords, platitudes and get the programs that actually get the job done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273715">What this speech felt like for me was something like the first speech I heard in this place. I had used the term a “big old nothing burger”. To me, Throne speech two may have improved the recipe a little, maybe added a bit of meat or even a tomato, but, no. What we got was a recycled, stale-bread, list of old promises and the Liberals branded it under “A Stronger and More Resilient Canada”. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273716">There has been a lot of spending, a lot of talk on spending, but very little about how we will create the revenue to get us out of this mess. The throne speech made no mention on how we would increase exports and market share. There was virtually no mention of the energy and resource sector, which has been a driver of economic growth for the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273717">Nothing spoke about the western alienation that is currently happening, particularly in my great province. We have yet to see a budget from the government. When I came here, I expected that would be the first thing we would see from the government, a budget and a road map toward recovery, and we have seen neither.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273718">I could ramble on about a whole handful of promises that are made in the throne speech, but I want to focus on a couple of things, particularly something the Liberals have been claiming they have been rapidly accelerating for five years now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273719">Since 2015, apparently the top Liberal priority has been to connect incredibly patient Canadians with high-speed broadband, both in urban and rural areas. This fever pitch for connectivity has only been exacerbated because of COVID-19. Students, teachers, small business people, all kinds of folks have needed the Internet to carry on in their daily lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273720">What do we have? In 2016, we had the $500-million connect to innovate program; the CRTC's $750-million broadband fund; accelerated investment in 2018; and another announcement today. There are a lot of announcements for money, but little in announcements for actual action. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="253407" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> today said that soon people would have better connectivity. We need to get this right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273721">There is the 5G program and the delay of the spectrum auction. Those things have been held up, and we are not getting the results we need. There are innovative solutions out there. There is the potential for new providers to come into this marketplace and provide some solutions. All they need is for the government to get out of the way, give some approvals and ensure it happens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273722">What I heard in the Speech from the Throne was not a story about how we can grow again, not a story about how we can get the economy going, not a story about how we are going to create new jobs, not growing Canada and not growing our economy. That is why I will be voting no. There is no vision. It is a bunch of recycled promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273723">I do have confidence, though, in the human spirit and the ability of businesses and the private sector to grow. I do have confidence that they can overcome the challenges that we have today. We have great innovators and great businesses. They can do it if we let them do their jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273724">Unfortunately, Canada fell out of the top 10 ranking of the world's most competitive economies and Canada has fallen nearly to the bottom of its peer group on innovation, ranking 13 out of 16 peer countries by The Conference Board of Canada. Global Innovation Index ranks Canada 16th out of 20 countries. This is not acceptable. This is a country that should lead, not follow, and it is unfortunate we have not had the policies to get this done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273725">Therefore, it is time to get busy. It is time to get off the platitudes. It is time to talk about policies that will unleash the private sector by reducing regulation, encouraging investment and allowing Canada to be competitive again. We have a great country that has incredible potential. We have great people who want to succeed and I want them to succeed, but we need policies that support this. Unfortunately, the government is on a trail that does anything but that. </ParaText>

This is no ordinary FIPA, like many of the FIPAs we have signed with other countries.

We cannot block Huawei on national security grounds based on the Canada-China FIPA, so I am wondering, with this new policy that we are thinking about, how we are going to deal with this incredibly anti-democratic and lopsided agreement the Harper government has locked this country into.</ParaText>

Due to the work and co-operation of all parties, I am pleased that the House of Commons has unanimous support for hybrid sittings and voting in Parliament. For my constituents, that means that whether I am working for them and casting votes in Ottawa or from Kitchener—Conestoga, I hope they know their voices have been and continue to be represented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273745">I assure constituents that protecting the health and safety of Canadians, their jobs and our economy is my top priority. I value their ideas and I look forward to the conversations we will have and to being there for my constituents. I am honoured to continue our dialogue. It is one of the things that motivates me to work hard for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273746">Co-operation from all parties and all levels of government is what Canadians expect of their elected officials. It is certainly what I endeavour to work toward because co-operation and collaboration will help us get through these times. I understand that once debates start there will be disagreements and that is what debate is about. That is healthy for our discussions. However, I implore all members here and elected officials of all levels of government, as Canadians, let us strive to talk to each other instead of yelling past each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273747">I want to thank all the front-line and essential workers who work hard to keep us safe. I was humbled to meet many as my staff and I enacted a “feeding the front lines” initiative in our riding, delivering food and expressing thanks to our first responders. I want to thank all nurses, health care workers and front-line staff, and let them know that we are grateful for their hard work and the tireless sacrifices they have made. They are keeping our community safe and they are appreciated.</ParaText>

I enjoy checking up and socializing with seniors online through conversations and music.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273749">Whether it is stopping in and checking up on neighbourhood stores or visiting and supporting local farmers and vendors at our markets, these occasions have demonstrated to me the resilience of our community. I will continue to support our local businesses through visits, phone calls and video chats to make sure they have access to the economic recovery plans they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273750">To keep our community informed and to address questions and hear from constituents, since March, I have been hosting virtual town hall meetings. We just had our 17th virtual town hall a few nights ago. It has been an important way for me to keep connected with our community. I have hosted town halls with our regional chair, all the mayors in Kitchener—Conestoga, our police chief and more. Topics have included a virtual Eid, discussions with members from our LGBTQ+ community, a family violence panel, and racism and diversity conversations with our <Affiliation DbId="253404" Type="4">Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273751">It is conversations like those and the one-on-one chats with neighbours in our communities that allow me the privilege of taking the ideas I hear in Kitchener—Conestoga and bringing them to Ottawa. Our government listened to those ideas shared by me and by many others from across Canada. Our ideas were brought forward last week in the Speech from the Throne as we laid out our government's plans to help Canadians. As we fight this pandemic, we will continue to support people and businesses.</ParaText>

They are the major drivers of our economy and add greatly to our society and our lives. In Canada, we recognize that the cultural sector is a force for developing our communities and our identity. It was our artists that we turned to for connection during our isolation. The music we listened to, the books we read and the shows we watched all helped us feel connected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273753">Organizations and workers in the arts, culture and sports sectors were among the hardest hit. Cancellations, closures and uncertainty still exist. I am proud to say that our government has been there from the beginning for our artists and we will continue to be there for them. Programs like the wage subsidy, Canada emergency response benefit and now the Canada recovery benefit will continue to be there for our artists, just like they are there for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273754">Conversations in support of equality and inclusion are essential as well, especially at a time when we are challenged by a global pandemic and heightened injustices. Diversity and inclusion are the building blocks of Canadian identity and a source of social and economic strength. As we celebrate progress, we must also commit to the work that still needs to be done. Discrimination still exists, and as long as it does, we must always stand up and speak up.</ParaText>

Racism and discrimination can be difficult to discuss and will be even more difficult to overcome, but we must have these conversations. We cannot remain silent. We must take action and do what is necessary, even when it is difficult. That is what Canadians do. Now is the time to seize these opportunities and work to fix these inequalities. </ParaText>

We must also continue to work tirelessly on reconciliation with indigenous peoples. We will keep supporting our farmers and food producers, who are essential in providing us with quality, affordable food in stores and on kitchen tables. In Kitchener—Conestoga, we have a proud heritage of a very vibrant agriculture and agri-food industry. We know the agriculture sector has been hard hit by COVID-19, and we have taken steps to provide support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273759">We have an opportunity to accelerate the work needed to protect our environment. I look forward to working together and to meeting those challenges to make a difference, because what is good for the environment can also be good for our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273760">Canada is communities supporting communities and neighbours helping neighbours, and in that spirit, we open up our hearts to others. I have seen first-hand the resilience of our communities as we persevere. Local thrift stores in my riding are full of donations and food banks are receiving support from individuals and families, including produce donated from our local farmers. Local businesses are volunteering to make masks and hand sanitizer to support front-line workers and local care homes. These are just a few of the countless stories that continue to inspire me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273761">Simple acts of kindness, from children writing encouraging words in sidewalk chalk to neighbours helping to support each other, are all woven into the fabric of what it means to be compassionate and what it means to be Canadian.

              <ParaText id="6273775">I would like to speak about the arts community because until the election in 2019 I was a full-time musician and a self-employed artist. Most of my friends still are in that arts sector and there are people who are affected, including members of the Stratford Symphony Orchestra, the Drayton theatre and the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony. All of these groups wanted to get back to work and they needed support right away. So many of them were self-employed and just trying to make a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273776">The wage subsidy and the CERB were two lifelines to help the artists I know, who just wanted to get back to work and contribute to society. They are very appreciative to have that specific support, so I hope we can continue to support those industries: the arts, hospitality and the tourism industry, which is particularly hard hit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273777">Mr. Speaker, I must compliment the member for <Affiliation DbId="253147" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation>, I am quite impressed with everything he has said. Just listening to him provide his reply to the throne speech, we can tell he has the pulse of his community that he represents and is a very strong advocate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273778">What comes to my mind right away in listening to my colleague is one of the things that <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> requests of the caucus. I suspect other parties have their own ways of trying to provide input to their leadership. However, in our caucus there is this feeling that when we listen to what our constituents say and we take that information and share amongst our colleagues, in particular ensuring that it gets up to those individuals who are making the changes, developing the programs, we can really have a positive impact on what is taking place today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273779">I really appreciate the comments from the member. Like many of my caucus colleagues, I know there has been a number of virtual town halls conducted, along with reaching out into the communities, listening to what business has to say, and being there for our constituents day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273780">For members of Parliament, it is not a Monday to Friday, nine-to-five type of job. It is a seven days a week job. As we witnessed just the other day, sometimes it can be fairly late, even going into the next morning, and it is not just for votes. We listen to our constituents and try to serve them in the best ways we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273781">COVID-19 has in fact changed things. For me, personally, for 30 years I have been going to a local restaurant on a weekly basis to meet with constituents. It is something I am known for within my riding. I cannot do that anymore. In the last few weeks, I have not been able to go there because I want to promote being safe, and I want to provide for physical distancing. I lose that aspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273782">However, through this process, I have learned something else. It is called Zoom, these video conferences that have been taking place. Now I will often meet with constituents through videoconferencing. We have videoconferencing, we use our telephones more, and so on. Offices might be taking appointments as opposed to having walk-in traffic. Things have changed. We have all had to adjust. Some industries, some businesses have been more challenged than other businesses and industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273783">The impact on Canadian society has been significant, as it has been around the world. A year ago at this time no one was talking about COVID-19. We were in the midst of an election. There was not one word about a pandemic. How quickly things have changed. When we stop and think about it, and I have referenced this in the past, it came down to the government working and doing its consultations, making the decisions to shut things down. From virtually nothing, dozens of programs were developed in order to support Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273784">Imagine being in an industry where the shutdown of the Canadian economy to the degree in which it was shut down meant becoming unemployed, or being an individual who was already finding it difficult to meet their needs, and looking forward, eight months ago, to the pandemic. We were talking about a first wave. Some countries in the world did not avoid the curve. Their numbers went up fast, in days and weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273785">Working with our partners in provinces and territories, municipalities, endless non-profit organizations out there, as well as private individuals getting engaged in fighting COVID-19, we were able to stay under the curve and that was supported in many different ways.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273786">At the national level, we developed programs like CERB, which helped just under nine million Canadians in every region of our country. We provided support to businesses by coming up with a program for wage subsidies, so those employees would not lose their jobs; they would be able to continue on. It helped tens of thousands of employees across this country, literally saving businesses from going bankrupt. We identified specific areas where we needed to provide additional support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273787">Today is National Seniors Day. It is a great day to recognize and share some love with a senior. That is a group that we recognized when we gave the top-up, for everyone on OAS, of $300, and for the poorest of our seniors, we added another $200 to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273788">As I say, it is one of many different programs that were developed. The federal government has played a very strong role in this pandemic. In fact, if members take a look at my province of Manitoba, I suspect what they will find is that 90% of the actual dollars of support come from Ottawa, with the balance coming in from the province. We have recognized just how important health is to Canadians. We have committed literally hundreds of millions of dollars in just the province of Manitoba, to provide that additional support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273789">When it came time to say to Canada that we needed to shut things down and get control over what was taking place, Canadians responded in a very positive fashion. It was really encouraging. We are in the second wave. We are now in a better position for the second wave as a direct result of the many actions that were taken months ago. Because the education curve that is required is nowhere near as steep, we know the types of things that are important to do. We have learned from some of the science that has come forward since the beginning. At the very beginning, health experts were not saying that we had to wear masks, but today we know health experts are saying we do have to wear masks. That has helped us through the second wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273790">We know how important testing is, and that is why we came out with the $19-billion safe restart program with the provinces. Members can imagine a national government working with all the different provinces and territories and developing a $19-billion program that enabled us to work together to make sure that we are protecting the health and well-being of Canadians as we try to get the economy going. For the province of Manitoba, that money allowed for 3,000 tests a day, instead of 1,000 tests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273791">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced yesterday that we are now moving forward on the faster testing mechanisms that are finally there. I think it is important that we respect the fact that throughout this process we have been listening to Canadians and our health experts, we have been working with our first-class civil service, the best civil service in the world, and we have been making a difference. Collectively, premiers of all political stripes and members of this House of all political stripes have been able to contribute. It is making a difference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273794">The Speech from the Throne mentioned that the government was not only going to bring forward measures to meet its Paris commitments, but in fact bring forward measures to exceed them.

I know there are many aspects of the throne speech that I would like to speak to, including long-term care as well as others, but I believe that the pandemic has heightened the discussion around racism and I want to focus my energies on that. I want to acknowledge the work of the Canadian parliamentary Black caucus and its advocacy, as well as the enormous number of young people who have more or less been on the streets for the last several months. I am so inspired by seeing a resurgence of the civil rights movement in our lifetime, and I want to thank them for their enormous work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273808">There are three aspects to racism and how to tackle it and how to, I would even dare to say, eliminate it. There are three components that I want to talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273809">First is the idea of eliminating the systemic barriers for people to achieve their truest and fullest potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273810">Second is making sure that we equalize the playing field. We should have equal support and an equal starting point so that everyone can be the best that they are able to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273811">Finally, it is the idea of empowering individuals to climb greater heights and get to a point of self-determination where they can control their destiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273812">In Canada and in many parts of the world, this is not so simple. I know the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> yesterday spoke about how his party and its first leader, Sir John A. Macdonald, founded Canada. From his perspective he may be correct, but it is a fundamentally flawed understanding of the history of this country. When we talk about, for example, the Indian Act, and how the Indian Act has disenfranchised first nations people across this country, separated them from their lands, their families, their livelihoods and their traditional ways of life, and saw them lose their language and their culture, this is systemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273813">We saw the effects of residential schools, and heard a very moving statement yesterday by my good and dear friend from <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> about her experience with residential schools vis-à-vis her partner, Romeo Saganash, who is a former member of Parliament. We cannot even start to comprehend the depth of hatred that one must have had in order to develop laws of this nature.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273815">One would think that the COVID pandemic is colour blind, that COVID-19 is a virus that does not see colour and does not discriminate based on one's identity. However, we know that is incorrect. We have excellent statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom, and some statistics from Canada are emerging. Public Health Ontario, for example, has said that people in the most ethnically diverse neighbourhoods had rates of getting COVID-19 three times higher than those in the least diverse neighbourhoods.</ParaText>

According to the same data, Black people have the highest share of COVID-19 cases, 21%, while, to put it into perspective, they constitute 10% of the population in Toronto, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273817">COVID-19 has demonstrated the racialized outcomes that we see in many other aspects of our systems. Let me just illustrate the many disturbing images we have seen with respect to racism in the past several months.

This is the time for us to recommit and, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in the throne speech, to redouble our efforts to address the root causes of racism. It is not going to be easy and it is not going to be overnight, but it needs to be coordinated and it needs to be an all-out Canadian effort. It needs to start by acknowledging that systemic racism is there. That is not up for discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273825"> It is about ensuring that our laws, for example on mandatory minimum sentences, are changed. It is about ensuring that we have an equal playing field when it comes to the criminal justice system. It is about ensuring that we continue on the path toward reconciliation, ensuring that we bring into law the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. For far too long, we have avoided these conversations, but it is important that we take bold steps today and build on the many things that we have done in the past, including the national anti-racism strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273826">That is not enough. We need to continue on this path. I hope my colleagues across the aisle will continue to work with us on this, to ensure that we are able to build a country that will work toward eliminating and empowering and equalizing matters for Canada's indigenous people, as well as Black and other racialized minorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273846">I would not call this pandemic an adjustment, annoyance or inconvenience, although it is all of those things and we feel them every day. It is not an economic shock like we had in the 1970s with the rising price of oil. A more apt word for what we are living through is “disruption”. By that I mean that this pandemic is going to cause transformational change in our society in the same way that World War II caused transformational change. We know that World War II was followed by a baby boom, economic and technological development, mass production, television, the expansion of the suburbs, a new consumer culture that drove the economy, the birth of the youth culture and the quest for the moon. This is a pivotal moment in history, the same way that World War II was a pivotal moment in history.</ParaText>

We give each other that help through social programs like the ones our government announced over the course of this pandemic.

Even if everything is going well for us in life, all of a sudden we might find ourselves in a serious financial difficulties through no fault of our own. In some ways, we are moving to a new society. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273851">The throne speech and Bill <Document DbId="10867435" Type="3">C-4</Document> recognize that we are at a transformational moment. They seek to ensure that Canadians are not left behind by this transformation and, in fact, evolve with it, through the support measures that are required to ensure that we can maintain our standard of living and can continue to have a productive economy. There are investments in, for example, green technologies and even blue technologies, as the throne speech did mention water, a topic that I have been interested in for quite a while.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273852">The throne speech is visionary in the sense that there is a short-term component and a long-term component. It announced a series of goals and objectives that are intended to bring us into this new era with all the right policies in all the right areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273853">World War II had grave fiscal consequences. In a similar way, this pandemic has changed the financial picture for governments, not only here in Canada but around the world. For sure, Canadians are concerned about the fiscal impacts of this pandemic. I speak to constituents who ask me about the deficit and the debt. However, I think it is important that we put these things in perspective, not to minimize or discount them, but to ensure that we have an enlightened and informed discussion on the best path forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273854">We will have a projected deficit in 2021. We said that it was going to be $343 billion, but the PBO disagreed and said that it would be $328 billion. Members cannot accuse the government of fudging numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273855">Coming out of World War II, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 100% and the deficit-to-GDP ratio was 21%. Today, the PBO forecasts that the debt-to-GDP ratio will be under 50%. What was the debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of the Mulroney Conservative era? It was 66%, so we absolutely need to put things in perspective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273856">We know there is a rule that has been taught to us by indigenous peoples. It is the seven generation rule and it generally applies to decisions that impact the environment. The rule says that if we pose an action that impacts the environment, we should think of the next seven generations to see how that decision will impact the environment for the next seven generations. I think we should apply this to our financial decisions as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273857">How will the financial decisions we are making today impact future generations? We talk a lot about future generations in the context of the budget deficit. Let us think for a moment. What if we had not taken the measures that we took? What would that have meant for future generations? What would that have meant for the young person who could not get their career started, who could not find a job, who could not earn money to pay for their education? Those young people would form what we might call a lost generation. We are very fortunate that we are at a time in history when interest rates are very low and, if interest rates remain low and the growth rate exceeds interest rates, we will be able to bring down the deficit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273886">Mr. Speaker, I will share my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252797" Type="2">Red Deer—Mountain View</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273887">I am very pleased to be here today as the Conservative Party's new public services and procurement critic and very happy to have this opportunity to reply to the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273888">I was very pleased to be with my leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252627" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation>, yesterday during his response to the throne speech. His reply was nearly an hour long and was very heartfelt. He was down to earth, as we say back home. I am sure Canadians will pick up on the difference in terms of vision between the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, and the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273889">I could spend my time today talking about the government's gaffes, its bad management, its duplicity and, according to some, its corruption. We could also talk about how badly its female cabinet ministers have been treated, its ethical breaches and its bungled border management. The Prime Minister tends to be dictatorial in managing his team and in his approach to Canadian politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273890">What bothers me the most is that so many of his cabinet ministers refuse to say anything. They are like statues; they say nothing, turn a blind eye and let their Prime Minister do as he pleases. Of course, it is easy to criticize and I could go on all night. We have five years of experience behind us. Early on, the Liberals lamented the fact that the Conservatives had been in power for 10 years, but the Liberal record for the last five years is far more complicated and bleak than anything the Liberals could say about us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273891">Today I want to talk about our position on the Speech from the Throne, our vision for Canada and the positive proposals we would like to put forward. What we are proposing to Canadians is an agenda and vision that are realistic, honest and transparent. The word “transparent” is very often misused on the Liberal side. The Conservatives are going to make sure that that word becomes meaningful once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273892">As my leader said, the dangerous and ideologically driven economic decisions made by this government over the past five years have resulted in the decline of Canada's competitiveness. We will restore Canadians' trust by working with small businesses, major industries, innovators and not-for-profits to help move this country forward. We will establish a financial plan to balance the budget in a way that is prudent and compassionate towards the disadvantaged. On the one hand, we must look after the most vulnerable and, on the other, we must get Canada's finances back on track.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273893">Financial visions are often diametrically opposed. Those on the far left will bust the budget to give more to everyone, even if it means ending up in the red. At the other end of the spectrum, those on the far right will tighten the screws as much as possible. However, it is possible to strike a balance, and that is the Conservative approach. We must be compassionate and take care of the most vulnerable while properly managing our finances. We must avoid spending and creating pointless programs purely as an illusion. We must deal with real life, not the abstract. We want to be compassionate, but we must also think about everything that is happening and the deficits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273894">Everyone agrees that the spending and investments associated with COVID-19 were necessary. We supported the various measures taken to help Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273895">Let us forget COVID-19 for a moment. As of January 2020, the Liberals had been in power for four years and had added $100 billion to Canada's debt. That is a problem. Who is supposed to pay for that? Money does not grow on trees. Taxpayers will have to pay back these deficits through taxes. Of course, with the pandemic, the deficit is becoming even bigger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273896">We need to show compassion for taxpayers. We must always consider the people who pay for all the government's spending. Take young people, for example. My kids are teenagers. My daughter wants to do some things, my son wants to do others. What does the future look like in the next 10, 20 or 30 years? We certainly need to think about it. We have a duty and responsibility to do so. Every government should make this a standard priority. It will be the priority of a Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273897">When it comes to taxes in Canada, there is a problem: it is very complicated. There are lots of tax rules. People who have the means or know tax experts and lawyers find ways to pay less tax, but workers and small business owners who do not have the resources keep on paying taxes. They do not know how the system works because it is too complicated. The next Conservative government will simplify the Income Tax Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273898">We will also take a look at barriers to interprovincial trade, which have been preventing free trade within Canada for too long. We negotiate free trade agreements with other countries, yet selling Quebec products in British Columbia and vice versa is difficult. That makes no sense. We need to remove interprovincial barriers. Our confederation is supposed to include an economic union, and we will make sure Canada can operate that way. A confederation is the number one place where things should be done intelligently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273899">Canada must never again be caught off guard by a crisis like COVID-19. We need to have a domestic stockpile of personal protective equipment, key essentials and medicines. These items are important for any country to have, and Canada must always be prepared. This is an important lesson, and we have taken note. There is no question that one of the next Conservative government's priorities will be to ensure that Canada has all the essentials it needs and does not have to rely on other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273900">Rapid response capacity is important. Recently we saw that some countries were able to approve saliva tests quickly, while in Canada, it is going to take months. That is not normal. Health Canada and every government department need to take a hard look at their operations in order to speed up the process. The response has to be rapid and immediate. We cannot allow the bureaucracy to prevent Canada from getting out of this crisis faster than another country. We have to overcome these problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273901">We also have to think about protecting the food supply. Canada has a cold climate. Foods like fruits and vegetables often have to be imported, except in the summer. We need to find ways to develop structures that will enable us to have greenhouses where we can grow food year-round. All essential products should come from Canada as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273902">When it comes to foreign investment, Canada must protect itself. Certain countries and foreign corporations have their sights on our land, our mines and our high-tech companies. We need to make sure that Canadian interests are protected first and foremost. National security checks are important to ensure that we do not let any part of Canada get into the hands of malicious foreign actors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273903">The Conservative government was in office during the great recession and crisis of 2008-09. The Harper government faced the crisis, and most importantly, it was able to overcome it. Yes, we had to make the necessary investments. Those investments often went against basic Conservative principles, but it was the right thing to do. The Conservative government then got Canada back to a balanced budget. Actually, I would remind the House that Canada returned to a balanced budget in time for the 2015 election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273930">When we look at how this pandemic has affected countries around the world, we can take some comfort that despite the hardships endured by so many of our fellow Canadians, we did not experience the horror stories of overwhelming hospitalizations that were initially expected based on the realities of many European nations and some large U.S. cities. That being said, there are still many heart-wrenching stories, especially of seniors and those in institutionalized care who have suffered immensely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273931">On a personal note, I have been notified of many constituents whose last days were marked by isolation and whose loving families had to postpone or vastly limit their celebrations of life. To let their names live on in Hansard, let me name just a few neighbours: Betty Howell; Darryl “Dude” Hughes and Loretta Moran; lifelong 4-H ambassador, Bob Boulton; former teaching colleague, Ed Tessman; my niece, Roselie (Moore) Engman, who sadly had to hear of her husband Andy's death through her hospital room window a few months prior to her own passing; my wife's cousin Betty Wood; and my dear friend, Bob Clark, former legislator, teacher and sports builder, who I will specifically honour at a later date. To their memories and to the well-being of all my constituents, I humbly speak on their behalf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273932">More than a month ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> chose to hide from yet another ethical scandal by completely shutting down Parliament. All the great work that the committees were doing to get to the bottom of the WE scandal came to an end, as did the work of all other committees, including the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I was a member. We have just spent a few days debating the Liberal government's latest attempt to correct its mistakes. There is no question that because of the actions of the government, many Canadians are in need of the financial support, which the three new programs we recently debated will deliver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273933">I will turn my attention now to the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273934"> What we heard in the Speech from the Throne cannot be called a plan at all. What we have heard is a lot of recycled promises and a continued failure to address the needs of my community as well as the needs of hundreds of communities across Alberta and right across Canada. What we have heard is a self-serving political agenda that will bankrupt Canadians for generations to come, with spiralling debt and no commitment or viable ideas about returning to a balanced budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273935"> The Liberal government's Speech from the Throne completely ignores our resource sector, our critical importing farming sector, our retail and service sector and our manufacturing sector, all of which account for millions of Canadian jobs and contribute billions of dollars to our economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273936">In my riding of Red Deer—Mountain View, farmers and ranchers remain a linchpin of our economy, as they do in countless numbers of other communities across Canada. Across Canada, the agriculture and agri-food system normally employs more than two million people, which accounts for about 12% of total Canadian employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273937"> How does the Liberal government acknowledge this fact? Quite simply, it does not. The Speech from the Throne has about 7,000 words. In all, the word “agriculture” was hardly mentioned at all. In fact, the word “Alberta” is only mentioned once. Is it any wonder that the vast majority of people living in western Canada and Alberta, in particular, feel alienated by the Liberal government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273938">As the Liberal government builds its biased bluster from the Speech from the Throne, there is merely one line which references farmers and producers being key partners in the fight against climate change. What could this mean? We have to look elsewhere to find the answers to that question. What it apparently means is the Liberal government's additional crippling taxes. What we will find from the Liberal government is a proposal to further cripple the sector as well as businesses across Canada by imposing another tax on top of the Liberal government's ill-conceived carbon tax. The new tax that will be hitting Canadians is the clean fuel standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273939">The last thing Canadian farmers and ranchers need is yet another tax that will increase their costs. We have already seen the devastating effects of the Liberal government's first carbon tax on farm incomes. The truth is that Canada's farmers, ranchers and processors have for years demonstrated an ability to deliver meaningful reductions in emissions and safeguards for the environment through adoption of new technologies, education and innovative management practices, but the government has ignored these efforts. It ignores the science and the facts in favour of pursuing an agenda to further its own political ambition at the expense of hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6273940">The Conservatives know that climate change needs to be addressed, but increasing taxes is no solution. The Liberal government's Speech from the Throne is silent on a number of other important topics as well. There is no mention of the important role the energy sector is playing to help reduce carbon emissions. In fact, there is no mention of the words “oil” and “gas” anywhere in the Liberal government's Speech from the Throne. This is despite the fact that oil and gas companies are normally responsible for more than 10% of Canada's GDP and are normally the largest private investors in the Canadian economy and the largest investors in Canadian clean technology to produce the most valuable export.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273941">I realize my time is getting short, so in closing I would like to note, as many economists and senior financial experts have also noted, that the Liberal government has completely abandoned its fiscal anchors and Canada's economic ship is adrift. In fact, the Liberal government's sky-high taxes, wasteful spending and massive deficits put Canada in an increasingly weak position before the pandemic had arrived. It is no wonder that friends and allies who are watching the Liberal government perform are wondering what happened to this once responsible and respected nation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273942">The truth is that Canada did not reach our current level of borrowing due solely to COVID-19 and the recession; it is a spending problem. If we are going to get Canada back on its feet, we need to put the Liberal health crisis opportunism aside, eliminate the barriers to our wealth-building oil and gas industries, eliminate uncompetitive programs that make agriculture and manufacturing difficult and unleash the power of true innovation in all sectors of our economy, not just the chosen few. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273943">The Conservatives know that creating the groundwork for a solid recovery will make caring for Canadians now and in the future something we can all be proud of.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273959">Mr. Speaker, yesterday was Orange Shirt Day, a day that honours residential school survivors, a day that reflects our attempts as a country to erase indigenous peoples, and for what purpose? It was to have access to the resources of this land unhindered, because our colonial government signed treaties they seemingly had no intention of following. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273960">Canada underestimated the strength and resilience of indigenous peoples, and continues to do so. Indigenous peoples have had to fight for their lives, for recognition and for rights. It is a matter of survival. Five of the poorest postal codes in Canada are in New Brunswick first nation communities, and some Nova Scotia communities are not far behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273961">The livelihood fishery in St. Marys Bay is not a large fishing operation. It is a collection of individuals exercising their right to provide for their families and lift themselves from poverty. I read the article from The Guardian that the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries</Affiliation> shared today, which honours October 1 as Mi'kmaq Treaty Day. I respect the words that she shared, although they do seem to come a bit late considering how long this conflict has been going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273962">She stated that she grew up in a generation that was never taught about the history of indigenous peoples. It was not until she became a member of Parliament that she came to see the huge, unsettling gaps in her education, including the legal and cultural significance of treaties, and her obligation as a Canadian to uphold them. I commend her for being brave enough to admit that she began to learn about indigenous history so late in her life. This is important, and I truly believe that a severe lack of understanding and education is at the root of the current dispute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273963">In 1760, the Mi’kmaq, Wolastoqiyik and Passamaquoddy signed a peace and friendship treaty with the British Crown. It was recognized as an international treaty between two sovereign nations, and is upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada as being legitimate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273964"> On September 17, 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada acquitted Mi'kmaq Donald Marshall Jr. of three charges relating to federal fishing regulations. Marshall's legal team argued that he had the right to sell fish to make a living under the peace and friendship treaties. Here is where the moderate livelihood comes into the picture. Marshall's ruling stated:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273966">This begs the the following questions: Did the Supreme Court of Canada mean indigenous peoples have the right to fish with no regulations, under DFO regulations or under their own regulations? What does a “moderate livelihood” look like in 1999 or 2020?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273967">I would argue that a treaty right is a designate of a sovereign nation, and to extend the right without the ability to self-govern is not appropriate. Indigenous communities and leaders must take the lead in determining the definition of a livelihood fishery with the support of the federal government rather than the intervention. To begin to set monetary limits on a livelihood fishery, through definition, is problematic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273968">A policy drawn by the Mi'kmaq, Wolastoqiyik and Passamaquoddy describes a commitment to conservation as the first priority for the indigenous fishery.

While these agreements seem to be in good faith, there is no formal mechanism for negotiation for indigenous peoples. The unfairness on display continues an uneven relationship and ignores self-governance and sovereignty on unceded lands. Indigenous chiefs have the capacity and the knowledge to advocate for their nations and negotiate with the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273973">I ask that the minister immediately convene a discussion table founded on respect and recognition that allows for these conversations to continue.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6273974">Mr. Speaker, thanks to my hon. colleague for the very thoughtful presentation she just gave. Let me be clear. No relationship is more important to Canada than our relationship with indigenous peoples. Our government is working to build a nation-to-nation, government-to-government relationship based on respect, partnership and recognition of rights. We are fully committed to working in collaboration with first nations to implement their treaty right to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273975">Since the landmark Supreme Court of Canada Marshall decision in 1999, which affirmed these treaty rights, the path toward implementation has had successes and setbacks. Over the years, the department has launched several programs and made investments to address the rights of Mi'kmaq and Maliseet communities in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, beginning with the Marshall response initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273976">Subsequent programs, like the Atlantic integrated commercial fisheries initiative, continue to this day to provide funding and support to Marshall communities to build the capacity of their commercial fishing enterprises and to strengthen community economic self-sufficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273977">Last year we signed rights and reconciliation agreements with three first nation communities, but there are challenges. Recent events surrounding Nova Scotia's fisheries have brought these issues to the forefront. I want to stress, first and foremost, that our government's priority remains the safety of everyone involved and lowering all tensions on the water for a calm resolution to this impasse. This has to be a common objective for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273978">It is also this government's commitment to work collaboratively and respectfully with first nation communities to fully implement their treaty rights. The <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> speaks directly and regularly with first nations leadership and industry representatives. I think we can all agree that reconciliation is a Canadian imperative and it is important, especially on this being Treaty Day in Nova Scotia, for each of us to acknowledge that we have a role to play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273979">The issues surrounding this fishery are long-standing and deeply personal to all involved. The only way to resolve them is through a respectful and collaborative dialogue. We know that we need to do things differently and work in partnership with first nations to launch a fishery where members of the community can earn a moderate livelihood. This fishery must be viable, sustainable and have the tools it needs to succeed so that this fishery can be a resource for generations to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6273980">Mr. Speaker, I am sad that this issue has led to blatant displays of racism, threats and intimidation. Traditional ceremony has been mocked. There are social media posts about the need to re-establish residential schools, and signs in the woods of New Brunswick saying, “save a moose, shoot an Indian.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273981">I have heard from fishermen that there is a lot of anger, a lot of frustration, but the majority of people are not racist and they are just fed up over a perceived threat to the sustainability of the fishery. I understand the uncertainty of our economy, the fluctuation of our natural resources and the stressful cycle of fishing season and unemployment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273982">I understand the concern around conservation, but none of this can override the behaviours exhibited throughout this dispute. These are the questions and concerns that must be raised with government. As the lead federal agency for aquaculture development, and consistent with its departmental mandate, DFO must act and discharge its responsibilities in a manner that adheres to the policy principles, including addressing issues of public concern in a fair and transparent manner, communicating with Canadians and respecting constitutionally protected aboriginal and treaty rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273983">Today is Mi'kmaq Treaty Day. How fitting that we are here to discuss this topic of such historical relevance on a day meant to remind all of Canada that we are treaty people, and that a treaty is a covenant of law signed between sovereign nations. In Digby there were celebrations at the wharf, cultural displays and ceremonies where the Mi'kmaq and Acadian flags flew together as they should. </ParaText>

The Marshall decision was the trigger for many departmental programs and initiatives that have been implemented over the years. These programs have provided fisheries-related training and increased employment in Mi'kmaq and Maliseet communities, especially for women. They have also put licences, vessels and gear in the hands of these communities to help build their fisheries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6273987">We have been negotiating with Marshall groups since 2017 to collaborate on the articulation of their rights through the Rights and Reconciliation Agreements, but there have been challenges.
