              <ParaText id="6475693">Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, the most celebrated medical discovery of the 20th century was made by Canadian researchers. Sadly, as we approach the centennial for the discovery of insulin, diabetes is an epidemic in Canada. It directly affects 11 million Canadians and costs our health care system $30 billion each year. Every day, 620 Canadians are diagnosed with this devastating disease, and more than 20 Canadians die from diabetes complications every 24 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6475694">Indigenous people living in Canada are among the highest-risk populations for contracting diabetes. In many ways, colonialism has ushered in this reality. If Canada commits to adopting a national strategy, we are also responding to a critical call to action under the TRC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6475695">COVID-19 has only heightened the urgency to act. Adults living with diabetes are more likely to have a severe infection and about three times more likely to succumb to it. Eighty-seven percent of Canadians support the Diabetes 360° national strategy. It must be in the budget. We cannot wait another 100 years to end diabetes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6475700">Debbie was a champion for the community she served with such devotion. Her political career began in 1997, with her election as the ward 4 councillor. In 2018, she made history as the first woman elected as mayor for the township. During her years on council, Debbie was successful in bringing Brock its first Zamboni, a summer day camp program and an annual charity golf tournament. One of her biggest achievements was securing funding from the federal government for a community centre in Brock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6475701">Debbie was a strong community advocate, volunteer and friend, working alongside community organizations, ball and hockey associations, agricultural groups and the Girl Guides of Canada, and serving as the chair of the North Durham Relay for Life.</ParaText>

Organizations like the Somali Canadian Association of Etobicoke, the Sylvenie Lindor Foundation, the Somali Women's and Children's Support Network and Trust 15 make a real difference every day.

Through its exploratory visits program, the organization helps people discover the riches the regions have to offer, including nature, the great outdoors and the warmth of their residents.

              <ParaText id="6475716">Most independent travel advisers are women. Julia is an agent in Port Moody. She has had no income for 10 months, but owes an airline $7,000, which is money she does not have. Sandra is an adviser in Coquitlam. If clawbacks continue, she will have to find $20,000 to pay back the airlines. This is income already declared in her taxes. Most travel agents, like my constituent Monica, continue to spend hours on the phone with insurance, credit card and airline companies to complete cancellations for clients. Many go into debt paying back commissions for hard-earned bookings they continue to service. This is not a legitimate bailout plan for the aviation sector. </ParaText>

Of the 510 calls, 401 were tips regarding illegal guns.

              <ParaText id="6475734"> Despite the clear evidence of illegal guns fuelling gang violence, last week's Conservative private member's bill designed to curb violence through tougher sentences on possession of smuggled firearms was voted down by the Liberal government. That is unbelievable. Liberals are failing with their misguided approach to gun violence, and it is costing people their lives.</ParaText>

We could hear him, but he was not visible. I would ask, in future, Mr. Speaker, that you allow him to repeat his question so that he is in full view of Canadians to watch and listen to him as he asks the question.</ParaText>
