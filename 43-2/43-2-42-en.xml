              <ParaText id="6404701">Mr. Speaker, there are times when we all wish we could go back in time and change the course of history. Everyone wishes that December 6, 1989, had been just another normal day at the École Polytechnique in Montreal for the 14 brilliant young women who were violently killed and the other victims of this heinous, cowardly act that we still remember today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404702">On Sunday, it will be 31 years that they have been in our thoughts, 31 years since the following individuals died unjustly: Geneviève Bergeron, Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault, Annie Turcotte and Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404703">Unfortunately, we cannot change the past, but we can still change the future. It is our duty to never forget the misogynistic, anti-feminist nature of this attack that shook Montreal, Quebec and the entire country. It was a blow to the very heart of our values. These women and girls, women and girls across Canada and around the world should not have to be afraid to succeed, to be ambitious or to advocate for a better future. Gender equality is non-negotiable, now and forever.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404704">No parent should have to mourn the loss of a daughter as they did 31 years ago in Montreal. No family should have to hold each other in grief as they did in Portapique last April. The gun lobby does not like it when we use the term “assault weapon”. They say it is a meaningless term. Let me say what is not meaningless: the lives of the people we have lost to these weapons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404705">Canadians know that there is no place in our country for weapons designed to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time. They know that these weapons were not designed to hunt deer. That is why in May, we announced a ban on 1,500 models of assault-style weapons including the Ruger Mini-14 used by the killer in Montreal on December 6, 1989. It is now against the law to buy or sell these weapons in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404706">Furthermore, we will be moving forward very soon with legislation to implement the rest of our commitments to protect Canadians from gun violence. We need to address violence no matter where it happens, in public or at home. Women, girls and people of diverse gender identities deserve to be safe and to feel safe. During the pandemic, Canadians have been asked to stay home wherever possible to protect themselves and others. It has been difficult for everyone, so imagine how much harder it has been for those who do not feel safe at home, but do not feel like they have anywhere else to go. It is a simple fact. Gender-based violence has been made worse by this pandemic. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404707">In the past months, we have accelerated investments in shelters and transition housing as we continue to advance on a national action plan on gender-based violence. We have made important progress, but there is always more to be done. We are ready to do that hard work alongside advocates, volunteers and all those who are fighting for change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404708"> In May, we banned 1,500 models of assault-style weapons, including the Ruger Mini-14 used in 1989 at the Polytechnique. These weapons are tools designed to kill people, and they have no place in our society. We will soon be introducing a bill to implement the rest of our commitments on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404709">As we work to take these firearms out of circulation, we also have to tackle the root cause of the violence. We must be vigilant. We must fight misogyny, discrimination and hate everywhere, including online, in schools, in workplaces and everywhere else in our lives. The violence and racism that indigenous women and girls experience is unacceptable, and we must put an end to it. We must find a way to provide a safe environment with equal opportunity for all.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404710">Today, the percentage of women studying engineering in many schools all over the country is higher than ever before. That is great, but I know we can do even better. It is important that we continue to take concrete steps to encourage women and girls to pursue careers in STEM fields and it is important that we never forget why this is something to stand up for. We owe it to the victims of École Polytechnique, and we owe it to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404711">Our commitment to equality and to keeping our communities safe must remain strong. We must continue to stand by the girls and women, the minorities, the survivors and the allies who are fighting all forms of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404712">Life is fragile. In recent years, far too many tragedies like what happened at the Polytechnique have reminded us of that. Life is fragile, so we need to make sure our values are not. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404713">Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House on behalf of the entire Conservative Party to honour the memory of the women who were killed in the massacre at École Polytechnique in Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404714">On December 6, 1989, a misogynistic murderer driven by deep hatred shattered the dreams of young women who had their entire lives ahead of them. Let's call a spade a spade: that day, Canada suffered a terrorist attack, a femicide, an anti-feminist killing spree. This man was a terrorist, but although he wanted to make our country pay for its commitment to gender equality, although he wanted revenge against the women's movement, although he wanted us to pay for the values we hold most dear, his heinous crime failed to achieve those goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404715">The murders at Polytechnique showed our entire country how fragile our progress can be. It showed how easily our progress can be attacked. However, our country has never bowed down to terrorism. The women who were tragically killed that day live on in all the little girls who dream big and aspire to a good life. They live on in every female engineer who receives her iron ring. They live on in the women who are elected to the House of Commons. They live on in the hearts of the families who have so unfairly lost a loved one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404716">As we approach December 6, I rise in the House to read those women's names aloud, for they will never be forgotten: Geneviève Bergeron, Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault and Annie Turcotte. These names are forever etched in the memory of our country. They are symbols of the freedoms we cherish and, 31 years later, their names echo across the country as we remember the sacrifices, the pain and the tragedies that these women experienced in the name of equal opportunity and equal respect between men and women. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404717">These seem like basic concepts to us today because of the brave women who fought long and hard to change our country's history. The women who died at École Polytechnique were no exception. As our country confronts a public health crisis, it is more important than ever to care for our loved ones and to be there for people living alone. During this pandemic, we must take action against another shadow crisis, the rise of violence against women. Far too many women are still experiencing intimidation and domestic violence. We must do everything we can to prevent a tragedy like École Polytechnique from ever happening again. As we remember these victims, we remember that we must never let our guard down. I remember you. Canada remembers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404718">Thirty-one years ago, 14 young women were struck down in a horrible massacre at École Polytechnique in Montreal. As we remember them today, we can tell Canadians that they live on every time a young woman receives her iron ring as an engineer; every time we cross a threshold, as we did last week with 100 women in the chamber; and every time their friends and communities remember them. They live on, and 31 years later, our resolute defence of our values that were attacked that day stands strong, as does our commitment to fight even harder for equality and opportunity, and live up to the values our country holds dear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404719">On sombre days like this when we remember the victims, let us recommit to ending violence toward women and those vulnerable in our society. In a pandemic, when worry and mental health are touching every corner of our country and every family within the Canadian family, let us make sure that no one is isolated, no one is forgotten and that there is zero tolerance toward violence in our society.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6404720">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I too want to recognize this difficult anniversary, the Polytechnique massacre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404721"> Year after year, a kind of fog sets in when we think about the young women we lost in that tragedy. Those young women would perhaps be mothers today; they would be the ones now moving Quebec forward. Time always creates this fog. I therefore invite all my colleagues in the House and on Zoom to join me for a moment as we close our eyes and walk through this fog of time together. Let's close our eyes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404722">Now let's imagine that we are at École Polytechnique in Montreal on December 6, 1989. It is 5:05 p.m., and the day is almost over. It is already dark outside. There we are. We are walking down the hall. We go into a classroom on the second floor. There are about 60 students in the class listening to one of their own discuss mechanical engineering. The class is of course primarily made up of young men, but still, there are nine women who are also listening. It is 5:09 p.m. and a student is speaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404723">Let's keep our eyes closed. Imagine a young man giving a talk about mechanical engineering. Imagine that we are students, young men and women, looking forward to the end of the presentation and the end of the day so we can go home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404724">Then, all of a sudden, someone enters abruptly, unannounced; we can feel a lot of stress. He goes up to the student giving the presentation and tells him to shut up. “Stop everything”, he shouts. We hear him and understand that something is seriously wrong. We stop. It is not as though we have a choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404725">“Guys on one side, girls on the other”, he says. There is some nervous laughing, no one moves, it is a joke. Do my colleagues still have their eyes closed? Bang! A shot is fired into the floor, not in the air. It is awful. This is not a joke; something serious really is happening.<I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404726">Just imagine. The women are separated from the men, and the men are told to leave; they leave, almost relieved but feeling guilty. Imagine that we are one of those men. We can feel the uneasiness, right? We also feel relieved. We tell ourselves that we have to go get help, but we no longer know what is happening in that classroom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404727"> The man is there, in the classroom, talking to the nine young women. “You know why you're here,” he says. One of the young women says, “No.” Then he says, “I am fighting feminism.” One of the young women speaks, and when she does, everyone senses the fear and the hope that it will all stop. She says, “Look, we're just women studying engineering. We're not necessarily feminists about to march in the streets in a tirade against men. We're just students trying to live normal lives.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404728">It is all for naught. The man has already made up his mind, and he says, “You're women; you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.” Then he fires on them from left to right, like reading words on a page, and they fall from left to right, like reading words on a page. He leaves the classroom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404729">Let's keep our eyes closed. It is safer that way because he does not stop there, and if we open our eyes, we will see blood, despair and fear. More carnage ensues as he makes his way to the cafeteria on the first floor. Then he returns to the third floor and enters one last classroom.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6404730">Everywhere he goes, from the mechanical engineering class to the very last classroom where he will take his own life, he leaves a trail of blood, despair and fear. Thirteen people are wounded and 14 women have been murdered because of their killer's hatred for feminists. Let's close our eyes one last time and think of Geneviève Bergeron, Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault and Annie Turcotte.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404731">Now, let's open our eyes. We must not let the memory of the women of École Polytechnique fade over time. We need to keep their memory alive, keep them alive in our memories in some way. Yes, let's open our eyes and continue our fight against violence against women, our fight against misogyny and our fight for better gun control.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404733">Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, it will be 31 years since 14 women were killed at École Polytechnique because they were women. They were victims of misogyny. They were victims of men's violence against women. It is important to recognize that it was about hatred of women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404734">In the days after the massacre, there were many debates about why these women were killed. Even though the gunman was clear, saying that he hated feminists, many wanted to portray his actions as those of a madman. However, these killings were planned. They were calculated to terrorize women.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404735">In the months that followed, calls to action were made to recognize another pandemic, that of male violence against women. This pandemic continues today. Throughout COVID-19, women have had to deal with an additional threat, that of domestic violence. The overcrowding of shelters and the additional strain on other resources has made it harder to get help.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404736">Women are more likely to have lost their jobs and income during the pandemic, making it even harder for them to leave violence. Lack of affordable housing keeps women in dangerous situations because there are no safe options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404737">We know that indigenous women and girls are more likely to face violence and are more likely to be killed, yet the calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls were delivered 18 months ago today and action on those calls for justice have been too slow in coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404738">Transgender women, especially if they are racialized, also face terrible levels of violence and abuse. They are often victimized again by justice and health care systems that too often question their identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404739">Women and girls with disabilities are far more at risk for violence and abuse. As many as 60% will experience violence in their lifetime. That is a staggering figure. Many will never tell anyone or reach out for help.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404740">It was not just the families and friends of these 14 women who suffered a loss 31 years ago. We all lost women who were destined to have brilliant careers, who today would have been leaders in their field and could have taught another generation of engineers.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404741">Every day, women and girls are told to protect themselves from violence. If we asked any woman, we would know. She would give a list of ways she tries to stay safe from men. Women shoulder this burden because men still have not taken up our responsibility to end it. It is not up to women to protect themselves from men by worrying about what they wear, where they walk or who they date. It is up to men to stop hurting women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404742">Almost 40 years ago, Margaret Mitchell, the NDP MP for Vancouver East, stood in the House of Commons to ask a question about violence against women. The response from other parties at the time was laughter and heckling. In that moment, she brought an issue that remained hidden into the spotlight. Laughter did not stop her from fighting for the help that women needed, and fear of what others might think should not stop men from fighting sexism and misogyny wherever we find it.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404743">This weekend, as we remember that horrible night, I call on men to make a commitment to combat male violence against women. Let's take responsibility for putting an end to sexism and misogyny any time we see it happening. Let's tackle the racism and transphobia that fuel violence. Let's honour the memory of those 14 young women by building a world that is safe for everyone. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404748">The first words I spoke in the House were on December 6, 2019, in remembrance of the massacre at École Polytechnique. Today I think of the victims and the families of those lost, and indeed I think about Canada and what this day means for us as a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404749">I reflected then, as I do now, on the frame of mind of the individual who carried out the heinous act, and what could have possibly motivated a person to tear down the pillars of a community and snuff out bright lights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404750">Then, and now, I will say it was anti-feminism and misogyny. Violence against women and 2SLGBTQiA+ peoples continues to steal from us as a society. We lose aunties, sisters, friends, teachers and students. These words we share are important, our remembrance is essential and our actions must be immediate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404751">Since last December, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated the realities for women at risk, particularly marginalized women including trans women, girls, femme-identified and non-binary people, racialized women and women of colour, indigenous women and immigrant women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404752">We see article after article about record numbers of calls to women's shelters for those fleeing violence. We see survey after survey describing the increasing severity and frequency of the violence and torment women are facing in their own homes during lockdowns. We see the oozing growth of online vitriol and hatred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404753">In April, we saw another terrible massacre in Nova Scotia that began with intimate-partner violence. That day 22 people lost their lives, 13 of them women. I am also haunted by Chantel Moore's story. This young indigenous woman was shot in her home, alone, by municipal police in my home province in June, without an explanation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404754">Two weeks ago, the final report on the implementation of the Merlo Davidson settlement agreement shocked many of us, with revelations of systemic and horrific misogyny and violence within the ranks of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Hon. Michel Bastarache, independent assessor, describes Canada's national police force as having a toxic culture, and recommends nothing short of an independent external review to reform policing in Canada. We absolutely must undertake this work immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404755">When indigenous women disappear from their communities, their families cannot trust that their lives will be valued. As long as our policing institutions are fraught with misogyny and racism, police cannot possibly hold citizens accountable for their gender-based hate and violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404756">Today we remember the women whose lives were taken on December 6, 1989, at École Polytechnique by a man who hated the women who dared to study. We must also remember Chantel Moore and those lost in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404757">As each week passes we lose more. In 2018, there were nearly 100,000 victims of intimate-partner violence. Four out of every five were women. That year, 87 people were murdered by their intimate partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404758">Amid this pandemic, we have come together in the name of health. The year 2020 has proved that when we are united with a common goal, and when we tackle a societal crisis with intensity, albeit desperation, we can move mountains. We know change is hard, but we have seen progress. Bill <Document DbId="10867694" Type="3">C-3</Document> is a testament to moving the needle by legislating training on sexual assault for judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404759">I challenge my colleagues in the House and I challenge Canadians. What will it take for us to come together and to recognize gender-based violence as the crisis it is? We need to move this mountain. May we always remember this day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404798">Simply put, Canada still has no plan for receiving, storing and distributing a vaccine, and without a plan for vaccines, there is no plan for the economy. This is why, today, the Conservative opposition is putting forward a motion that Canadians deserve. We are pushing for clarity, certainty and competence on a vaccine plan.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404800">We ask the government to put the health and safety of Canadians first and start sharing when each type of vaccine will be safely delivered to Canada, how each vaccine will be stored and the plans for distribution. We are not just asking for this, the Canadian Armed Forces and General Vance are asking for this. The provinces are asking for this. Why is there secrecy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404801">Canadians also deserve to know the date on which each vaccine type will first be deployed in Canada and the rate the government expects vaccinations to be done by. How many vaccinations per month? Every other country in the G20 is releasing this information. Why is the Liberal government not releasing it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404802">As for a plan, provinces and health partners across this country need to know any intended federal guidance in terms of prioritization of groups, such as front-line health workers, the military and our vulnerable seniors. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talks about these things in press conferences, but refuses to detail a plan amidst the worst health crisis in over a century. Canadians deserve to come into Christmas knowing there is a plan to provide them with certainty. Families are struggling. They want their lives back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404803">The government also needs to indicate the plan for indigenous communities, many of them remote; Canadian Armed Forces families, at home and abroad; and veterans. These are three areas of exclusive federal health responsibility, and they deserve a plan too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404804">This motion is common sense, and it is presented in good faith. This detail is being asked for by the military, so we are asking the government to table it before Christmas. Let us show that this country will be ready. We may be later than some countries, and when it gets here, let us show them we are more ready. I hope the government can finally step up, after being late on the border, late on rapid tests, and now late with vaccine deliveries, to at least have a plan to show Canadians that 2021 will be a better year for our country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6404820">Madam Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has ably outlined the necessity of the motion, in terms of what it means to deliver a plan for Canadians, for us to see a way out of the COVID-19 crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404821"> What I want to do with my time is to talk for a minute about why it is so important to support the motion. The <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has outlined the gaps in the government's response, the panic that we have seen in the government and the need for certainty. He has done a wonderful job of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404822">However, I need to explain to members of the government what is happening. There is a story that came out today, and a quote from a man named Doug Manuel, a physician epidemiologist at the Ottawa Hospital. Here in Ottawa, we are actually seeing lower numbers of COVID-19, and I give credit to public health officials and to people, but Doug Manuel says that this is because of the high number of government employees who can afford to work from home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404823">What I worry about is that here in Ottawa there are a lot of people making decisions and a lot of people who are scrambling around who might not feel the urgency that is being felt in other parts of this country. There are millions of Canadians right now who had stable incomes, who had businesses, who had hope 11 months ago and who do not have that hope now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404824">I am not saying that there is anything wrong with public sector employees. I thank them for their work. However, the reality is that there are people suffering. When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> comes out of his cottage and says that businesses will be better off with extended lockdowns, that is a comment from somebody who is so privileged that he cannot understand the stress that millions of Canadians have been going through this year because of the lockdowns, because of the lack of certainty and because of the flailing that we have seen from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404825">This is why the motion is in front of the House today. It is compelling the government, in good faith, to give Canadians a way out, to give them a plan, to give them certainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404826">I asked Canadians, about a week ago, to send me stories of their experience. This is one stack. Hundreds and thousands of stories have poured into my office. I want to read one email. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404827">It says, “I returned to my full-time job from maternity leave at the end of March, during a time when I had no access to consistent child care and had three children at home, two requiring online schooling. My family struggled until our child care reopened. Life has not stopped because of COVID-19, all of the challenges that families usually face have only become more difficult to juggle. In addition to raising three children and working a demanding full-time job remotely from home and navigating the never-ending, shifting messages and restrictions and reopenings and closings that came between spring and fall this year, I also got the additional hit of having to navigate a legal custody battle in a confusing virtual setting that threw all the checks and balances of the old system out the window, all of which have led to a massive increase in my stress and anxiety for my family. I can say with certainty that my health and well-being, and that of my family, have been impacted by government lockdowns.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404828">She continues, “Here is a quick summary of how we have been affected: loss of child care, loss of income from companies making staff forced to take pay cuts due to the energy sector downturn and COVID, massive increase in anxiety related to school reopening, guidelines changing literally by the day, causing stress and anxiety for my children, loss of charter rights, freedom of association, limits placed on visitors in our own homes, loss of freedom of peaceable assembly, limits placed on gatherings, loss of freedom of mobility, loss of travel plans and cancellation of much-needed trips and meetings, increase in stress and anxiety, inability to see friends and family who need my help and are isolated due to travel restrictions, loss of ability to participate in our faith community.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404829"> This is what is actually happening. This is what is at stake here, not to mention the fact that we have seen thousands of Canadians die from COVID. We are seeing dire situations in our nursing homes. That is what is at stake here when the government cannot tell us basic information about how we are moving forward.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6404830">Then, at the same time, when these Canadians are writing to my office, they are seeing the United States deliver their vaccines. People are going to be getting the vaccine in New York state within hours or days. The United Kingdom has been deploying it today. Where is our plan? The current government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars, has shuttered Parliament and has abrogated our democratic institutions, all under the guise of stopping the spread of COVID but it has not stopped the spread of COVID. It is worse than it was when we started. We cannot stay on this course. We cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404831">Person after person has written to me with medical conditions that they have not been able to get treatment for because of the lockdown. People have written to me with severe mental health issues. People are desperate. We sit in here fiddling while Rome burns. The fiscal economic statement, the quasi-budget, that the government put forward last week had no plan. It was a bunch of guesswork, saying we are going to spend our way out of a virus. We need to have a plan on things like basic public health information, rapid testing and vaccines. That is why the motion is here in front of the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404832">Why does it take the opposition party to push the government to do what is right? Frankly, I think it is an issue of competence at this point in time. We have seen flailing from the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> on masks and closing the border. She said it does not transmit person to person but then maybe it does, and that we shut down our early warning system for the pandemic but do not worry we have the data, but we are not sure if it is three-ply or two-ply masks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404833">It is enough. People cannot get their kids to school. They cannot access mental health support. They are separated from their families. I sit here in a position of privilege, pushing for these things. I have not seen my kids in over six months. Do members know what that is like? Do they know what it is like to go home to an empty condo every day, knowing I cannot see my kids?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404834">I sit in a position of privilege. I have a paycheque. I want to know these things on behalf of millions of Canadians. When can I see my mother-in-law, who has stage four breast cancer? My story is not unique. I am privileged. When the government stands up and says maybe it will be September or maybe January and that the opposition is playing games, the government is playing games. It is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404835">All we are asking for today is some basic information. When can we possibly hope to receive this vaccine? How many days after receipt is it going to be deployed into the provinces? What is the federal government doing to deploy it? The government needs to be held to account. It has failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404836">The motion today is very simple. It would compel the government to give Canadians a plan with clear direction before Christmas, given that countries around the world have already done what is in here. They have been working on this for months. This is not asking for something that is unreasonable. This is asking for something that is vital to the lives of every single Canadian, millions from coast to coast and across party lines.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404853">Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to speak to the Government of Canada's work to ensure that Canadians have timely access to a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19. There are now more than 200 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in various stages of development around the world, with dozens in different stages and phases of clinical trials.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404854">This week, the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer became the first to be approved in the United Kingdom. Many other manufacturers are expected to submit their final data to the regulatory bodies in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union soon.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404855">As things stand now, we expect vaccines to become available in Canada in early 2021. After a long and very difficult year, this is welcome news and news for which we have been preparing for many months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404856">Canada's vaccination programs and regulatory approval systems are among the best in the world. We have well-established systems to deliver vaccines to Canadians and we have a long history of delivering vaccines for diseases like influenza, measles and polio. We will benefit from this experience as well as the infrastructure that we have built up over many decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404857">Over the past several months, there has been a lot going on behind the scenes to ensure that Canada is well positioned to obtain and deliver a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine to Canadians in 2021. From the earliest days of the pandemic, we knew we had to start to lay the groundwork for success. We acted quickly to put the mechanisms in place to ensure that when a vaccine was ready, Canada would be ready. One of those mechanisms is procurement. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404858">Based on the recommendations of the COVID-19 vaccine task force, Canada has signed agreements with seven different companies to reserve COVID-19 vaccine doses for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404859">We still do not know which vaccine will be most effective at preventing transmission. That is why we have pre-ordered the most promising vaccine candidates, with the possibility of increasing our order to have enough for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404860">Also, the government has committed $220 million to the COVAX Facility. I want to thank my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="253393" Type="4">Minister of International Development</Affiliation>, for that work. The COVAX Facility and its advanced market commitment is designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world to slow the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404861">This agreement includes the option of acquiring doses for 20% of Canadians and a commitment to invest $220 million supplementary to provide vaccines to countries that are developing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404862"> With these purchase agreements in place, the next step is to ensure that the new vaccines are safe and effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404863"> Vaccine development is highly complex and is a long process. Now in normal times it can take years to carry out extensive research needed to produce safe and effective product. However, these are not normal times and we are fighting a pandemic and human lives are hanging in the balance. The clock is ticking and scientists and researchers have leapt to the challenge. They have been working all around the world to accelerate development of a vaccine. This includes collaborating and taking advantage of the latest innovations.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404864">Health Canada is the regulatory body that reviews new vaccines to ensure that they are safe and effective and approves them. These reviews normally take place once all clinical trials are complete and the results have been released.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404865">However, given the urgency of COVID-19, we recognize the need for flexibility early to expedite this process without compromising safety, quality and efficacy. That is why this fall I signed an interim order to import, sell and advertise drugs during COVID-19. This interim order allows us to accept rolling submissions for drugs and vaccines. This means that manufacturers can submit data as it becomes available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404866"> Once an authorized vaccine is in use, Canada continues to monitor its safety through post-market surveillance. This system allows public health authorities to respond quickly to changing trends or unusual, adverse events. So far, Health Canada has received submissions for authorizations of vaccines for COVID-19 from four companies: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and, most recent, Janssen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404867">As these submissions are carefully reviewed, we are preparing for a successful rollout and distribution of the vaccines to Canadians. This will be an ambitious and complex program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404868"> Vaccines are typically sent directly from the manufacturer to provinces and territories. However, with certain COVID-19 vaccines a different approach is required. Due to their novel nature, they will have different sets of logistical considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404869"> For example, ultra-low temperature vaccines need to be kept at very cold temperatures, up to -80°C and these will need to be delivered directly from the manufacturer to the point of use and transport will be controlled by the manufacturer. Other frozen vaccines will be transported by a federally contracted logistics service provider from the manufacturer to the point of delivery, as identified by the provinces and territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404870">Of course, this requires deep collaboration with provinces and territories. The Government of Canada is working closely with all of them as well as other public health partners to ensure the process is timely, fair and well coordinated.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404871">As I mentioned earlier, we expect vaccines to become available in early 2021. Initial supplies of vaccines will be limited, and just three million Canadians will have access to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404872">Since the number of vaccines will be limited in the early stages, we will have to strategically determine who will be vaccinated first.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404873">In Canada, we look after the most vulnerable among us. That is why the Government of Canada is working with external advisers to identify the high-priority groups that will benefit the most from being vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404874">The National Advisory Committee on Immunization is a standing body, an external advisory body that provides the Public Health Agency of Canada with independent, ongoing and timely medical, scientific and public health advice in response to questions from the agency relating to immunization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404875"> On November 3, the committee released its preliminary guidance on key populations for early COVID-19 vaccination and outlined a targeted vaccination program. The committee identified several key populations including those that are at high risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19, such as the elderly and others with high-risk conditions; those who are most likely to transmit COVID-19 to those at high risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19; and workers essential to maintaining the COVID-19 response, such as health care workers and caregivers in long-term care facilities and people whose living or working conditions put them at an elevated risk of infection or where infection could have disproportionate consequences, including indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404876">These recommendations will help provincial, territorial and federal authorities decide how to distribute the vaccine. It is also important to note that we are working actively with national indigenous organizations to determine how to distribute the vaccine properly and respectfully in indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404877">Although the initial supply will be limited, I want to be clear that there will ultimately be enough vaccine for every Canadian who wishes to be vaccinated. However, as our country is geographically large, we will face some logistical challenges, such as the need for ultra-cold storage, reaching remote communities and coordinating between levels of government to name a few. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404878">In the face of such challenges, no one is more effective or has more experience than the Canadian Armed Forces. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Canadian Armed Forces have been fully involved in the Government of Canada's action.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404879">Last week, Major-General Dany Fortin was named vice president of logistics and operations at the Public Health Agency of Canada, and he is overseeing logistical planning. He joins the 27 Canadian Armed Forces personnel who are already seconded to the agency, including logistics experts, operational planners, pharmacists, health care administrators, engineers and information technology experts. We thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their assistance and expertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404880">In addition, the Public Health Agency is also taking action to prepare for the rollout of the vaccine. The stockpile has sites all across the country and has already started sharing necessary supplies with provinces and territories. This includes millions of needles, syringes, alcohol swabs as well as freezers for vaccine storage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404881">It is important to note that each provincial and territorial government is responsible for deciding how to deploy COVID-19 vaccines within their jurisdiction as well as who will get vaccinated first. The Government of Canada is working closely with provinces and territories, first nations, Inuit and Métis partners to help them get ready. This includes ensuring they have the necessary supplies and equipment as vaccines need to be managed safely and securely while ensuring rapid and efficient delivery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404882">I know Canadians are encouraged by the progress that we have made. Vaccines are on the horizon and they are almost within reach. We are about to embark on a future that is safer, healthier and, indeed, more secure for all of us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404883">In the meantime, we cannot let our guard down. We must continue our efforts and continue to practise physical distancing, wash our hands and wear a mask. That is all the more important now that the cold weather is forcing us inside and the holidays are approaching.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404884">We need to stay vigilant as we wait for a vaccine to be ready. We need to support our seniors. We need to support our neighbours with high-risk conditions. We owe it to our health care providers and essential workers. They are counting on us to protect them. I know people have been trying really hard and we need to keep trying for the next several months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404885">The government is taking every step necessary to authorize safe and effective vaccines quickly and to distribute them to everyone who wants them. We will be ready. Until then, we have to stay focused and steadfast in our public health measures, because, together, we will see a brighter future, one where everyone is protected from COVID-19.</ParaText>

Just this week, we conducted a tabletop exercise with provinces and territories to go through a dry run of what the delivery would look like and assess any kinds of complications. Provinces and territories at all levels, technical tables, medical tables and political tables, have been meeting to talk about vaccine deployment for months and we are very thrilled we are as far along as we are.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252623" Type="2">Mr. Yves-François Blanchet (Beloeil—Chambly, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6404915">Madam Speaker, the Bloc Québécois will give its consent and vote in favour of the motion introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> because we believe that accountability is key in any issue. We believe that Quebec and the provinces, which will have to manage the distribution and administration of vaccines, require more specific information. The minister cannot claim that all the necessary specific information is available, since the people responsible for these issues in Quebec have been expressing a certain amount of dismay about the lack of information on a daily basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404916">The government has a strong tendency toward denial. For example, when we ask the government questions about health transfers, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tends to respond, with unsettling obstinacy, that it is working hand in hand with the provinces, which are certainly not saying the same thing. Some provinces, civil society, Quebec's National Assembly and Parliament, as we heard yesterday, are saying that there is a problem with the health transfers, but the Prime Minister stubbornly says that everything is fine and that he is working hand in hand with people with whom he has no constructive contact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404917">For example, when we mention the French language in institutions under federal jurisdiction, he stands up and says loudly and clearly how much he loves the French language, while the facts, the behaviours, the delays, and the white papers conveniently pushing any action to after a future election clearly show his obstinate refusal to take any action at all in favour of the French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404918">When we ask when the vaccine will be available, we are given one or more explanations that do not always make sense. The people have the right to decide whether or not they find the answer valid. The media have the right to question the validity of the answer. The official opposition and the Bloc Québécois also have the right to ask these questions, because it is our job, and because we hear the stakeholders who will have to manage the administration of the vaccine saying that they do not have the information they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404919">Before publicly improving a situation and saying that it will do better, the government has to admit something. The government has to say that it would have liked to get the vaccine at the same time as everybody else, but that it did not succeed in getting it at the same time as everybody else, and then explain why it did not succeed in getting it at the same time as everyone else. Then, it needs to say what it is going to do to get it as soon as possible after everyone else gets it first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404920">There is something very basic about this admission, because it is not a partisan stunt. It is a process for getting out of an unprecedented health crisis that costs dozens of lives and affects thousands more every day. How can we take such an important matter lightly?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404921">The admission is crucial. Our political issues notwithstanding, I think that the population of Quebec and Canada would not react so badly. They would say that it is unfortunate, and that the government could have done better, and then they would ask what it is going to do now. Quebeckers and Canadians would react better than they will when, in the coming days, they start seeing people in the United Kingdom get the vaccine, then people in the United States, Germany and India, while they are still watching the press briefings of the Premier of Quebec and Dr. Arruda telling them how many new cases there are, what they will not be allowed to do at Christmas and, unfortunately, how many more people have died.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404922">The comparison will be hard to ignore, and the government will not emerge triumphant under full sail in the glory and enthusiasm of its great success. It will become obvious that it should have admitted its failure sooner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404923">We understand that the matter is going to be stretched out until next weekend, because then the government will not have to account for its actions in Parliament until the end of January, hoping that its faults, errors and bad deals will go unnoticed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6404924">The delay is by no means trivial. In Quebec alone, we are talking about 1,000 to 1,500 new cases and several deaths a day. The government needs to admit its mistake in order to make amends and mitigate the negative effects of its false discourse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404925">I suppose that the government is negotiating in private with vaccine manufacturers to try to shorten the delay. It should be negotiating, but not in private. However, it said something rather astonishing: it does not want to reveal how much it paid for the vaccines it has purchased so far because that could hinder its negotiations for future purchases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404926">That concerns me. Why does it not want to tell us how much it paid? How could that hinder future negotiations, unless it overpaid? If it overpaid because it had no bargaining power, any future supplier will want the same amount the other company got. I will get back to this. This will have an adverse impact on the government's bargaining power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404927">There are things like this that we do not know about. The government could have done any number of things, not to control the result, since people all over the world were waiting, but to improve the chances that we would achieve the desired result. Since we do not know exactly what was done, we are obliged to fill in the blanks, just like the media, commentators and analysts are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404928">The government had options. One was to manufacture the vaccines here in Canada, which would have been dependent on a number of variables. We understand that it wanted to upgrade a production facility at a cost of over $40 million. Delays have now built up, and that will not happen before next summer. We understand that another facility can be used to produce RNA vaccines, a relatively new technology, but that that will also have to wait, this time until July. Could the government have acted sooner or managed the production facility option differently?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404929">It could also have obtained patent licensing; in other words, it could have negotiated with the patent holders to pay a royalty to get the authorization to manufacture, replicate or copy patented technology. This principle also applies to industry and the arts. Some countries procured patent licences to produce vaccines. Canada did not. If it had, it would probably have been better able to speed up the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404930">It could also have produced vaccines without a licence. Producing vaccines without a patent licence may not be entirely appropriate, but it was an option under the emergency measures adopted in March, one which lapsed at the end of September. The government did not bother to extend these measures and retain Canada's right to manufacture what it needed to protect and save lives. It could have made subsequent arrangements with the patent holders. It gave itself the right to do it once, then waived that right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404931">That would have been a success factor for several reasons, not the least of which was that it would have given the government some negotiating leverage. When the government negotiated with the various manufacturers, it could have told them that, if it was not happy with the agreement, it would still manufacture the vaccine. That would have been quite conceivable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404932">Although the government will not answer our questions, it is our duty to make these assumptions. If the government had told the various manufacturers that it was going to manufacture the vaccine no matter what, the manufacturers would undoubtedly have been more accommodating when it came to the delivery date. However, the government did not use the leverage it once gave itself, having decided to forgo that leverage in September.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404933">It could also have synchronized its own approval process with that of the countries producing the vaccines. I understand that Canada has certain powers to ensure the safety of products used in Canada, but the Canadian process is relatively long, not to say very long or even too long.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6404934">In this case, in an unprecedented emergency, could the government not have decided to make an exception and to synchronize our approval with what was happening elsewhere in order to proceed at the same time as everyone else, at least in terms of authorization?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404935">None of these measures would have provided a certain or absolute solution to the problem, but each of them would have improved the likelihood of more rapid delivery and administration of the vaccine, which is the government's fundamental responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404936">When the government talks about 400 million doses, we see that it is just a political smoke show. We understand that the number of doses we will get in the first quarter of 2021, based on current guarantees, is probably not enough to cover the base, meaning, of course, those mostly likely to die or to spread the disease. I presume that negotiations are once again under way to accelerate delivery and obtain a larger supply of vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404937">I also understand that pharmaceutical companies in Canada are not very excited—or would not have been very excited—about the government forcing them to produce a vaccine created by a competitor. I understand that, but does that justify a delay in treating Quebeckers and Canadians for a disease that is too often fatal? Probably not. However, these companies want to keep their facilities for themselves because they think they too will be able to develop a vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404938">Is the government capitulating? I am asking the question; I do not know if it is. It is a good question, and we are here to ask questions. Did the government acquiesce to pharmaceutical companies in Quebec and Canada that did not want to make their facilities available to their competitors, even though they are in a better position than pretty much anyone else to retool their equipment? There is no way of knowing when that would have happened, but now we know it can never happen because it has not started. Did the government go along with what they wanted? Claims of having done the right thing will soon be revealed as mere pretense because people will notice that some people are being vaccinated and others, here, are not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404939">As with health transfers, there are also significant economic impacts. The provinces and Quebec need some flexibility to contribute to their own economic recovery. For example, the hundreds of millions of dollars in health transfers required are hundreds of millions of dollars that Quebec is using to invest in its economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404940">In this case, we are talking about workers. There are thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of workers employed by hotels, restaurants and the industrial sector. There are also teachers and mental health care workers. There are many factors that influence the economy directly or indirectly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404941"> I want to remind members that every unemployed worker represents an expense for the government. Every time we make it possible for a worker to return to work, it represents tax revenue for the government. Yesterday, I called that a four-point game. You take someone out of the expense column and put them in the revenue column. That is not neutral, it is better than neutral. A delay of six, eight or twelve weeks in obtaining the vaccine will delay the return to work and the economic recovery. That is a consequence that is all the more serious when we have a government that says, “to hell with expenses”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404942">Of course, this is just the beginning. The post-COVID-19 mass distribution and pre-election budget will be presented in March. There is something rather irresponsible about willfully ignoring the economic issues.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6404943">I think the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is in a state of denial. This obstinacy is harmful, just as it is when it comes to health transfers. Everyone is against him: the Quebec National Assembly, all the premiers across Canada, the Premier of Quebec, the Quebec finance minister and civil society in general. Polls have even shown that the public shares this point of view. However, the Prime Minister continues to say that he is working hand in hand with people who are looking at that hand and saying they want nothing to do with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404944">This is pure denial and we can also see it when the topic of French comes up. I mentioned this earlier. The Prime Minister likes to talk about how much his government loves the French language. We might have believed him at first, but very little has actually been done. I much prefer to hear the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> say that he has changed his mind on this issue, after having voted in the past against applying the Charter of the French Language to federally regulated businesses. I personally have no problem with that and welcome his change of heart. However, when someone scoffs at us, in a sense, when they say they love us but their actions suggest otherwise, that smacks of denial. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404945">As for the vaccine delays, this denial is detrimental to people's health, and the Prime Minister's responses are appalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404946">Again, as with health transfers, we have to keep up the pressure to prevent this from becoming a partisan spectacle of 20-second sound bites on the news. If Parliament, if the other legislative assemblies and if civil society put enough pressure on the Liberals they will realize that this will hurt them the only place that seems to matter to them: the pre-election polls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404947">All of us together have the power to put pressure and use good arguments to make the Prime Minister and his government realize that they have to do better and be accountable for their actions. They have to take much more decisive action and get the vaccine delivered sooner. They have to provide predictability to patients, people who fear for their life, the families of those people, those who want to return to school in person, and those who want to return to work in person. They also have to give a sense of security. They will not achieve any of these things by being in denial and sooner or later that will become clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404948">I offer the government my collaboration and I am sure that everyone in Parliament will do the same. I invite the government to be transparent, clear, lucid and compassionate and vote in favour of the Conservatives' motion. Then we all might make progress together on a real strategy for getting out of this crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404950">First, I would like to know whether it was a good idea for the Liberals to put all their eggs in one basket, a Chinese communist basket, which has now left us in the lurch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404951">My second question has to do with vaccination delays.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6404952">Madam Speaker, in answer to the first question, it is understandable for the government to consider a variety of solutions when it is facing a difficult challenge. It was not necessary to rule out a Chinese solution, but it was dangerous to give it too much weight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404953">The government will say that it purchased 400 million doses from seven suppliers. When it says that, I think that it is covering up something else that I would like to know more about. I do not want to make any accusations. However, did companies in Canada get special privileges in the fight against the pandemic because they wanted to win the race to develop a vaccine? If that is the case, and they do not find a vaccine soon, Canada's manufacturing and innovation capabilities will not be used to get us out of this crisis when the time comes to produce, manufacture or copy vaccines. I think that that was a grave mistake on the government’s part. Diversity is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404954">As for spending, I think it is understandable that it is so high. All the western countries have spent a lot of money. In most, if not all, cases, the central banks purchase government bonds, which is a way of printing money without causing damage, since it maintains the competitive balance between countries. However, that does not mean that we can spend whatever we want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404955">Sometimes it is a matter of symbolism. I am eager to see what the Conservatives are going to do. I gather that they intend to pay back the money they received under the Canada emergency wage subsidy. I am shocked, though, that the Liberals will not do the same, and I am offended that the Green Party and the NDP will continue to collect money that should be going to businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404983">I myself met with the people at Medicago. That is one example I can give in relation to the previous question. Innovation is happening, and it is often led by the private sector, by entrepreneurs, by researchers from well-respected educational institutions who decide to get involved in research so they can bring a product to market. Medicago is a very good example of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404984">Will the people at Medicago come up with a viable vaccine in time while we are making our way out of the crisis? Nobody knows. However, we do know they have been working on it, because we met with them. They told us about their process, and they eventually got funding. That deserves a lot of respect because Medicago is making a real name for itself in Quebec's pharmaceutical sector.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6404985">Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252984" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404986">I want to begin by talking about the situation that we find ourselves in right now.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404987">These are obviously difficult times. Many people are worried, and we understand why. The Liberal government has totally failed in its responsibility to create a plan for this pandemic. Generally speaking, the fear we are seeing is related to the fact that successive Liberal and Conservative governments have always forced families to bear the burden by cutting the services they needed. That is the history of those two parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404988">The other problem is that the Liberal and Conservative parties are too close to big business. In this case, it is clear that the Liberal government is too close to the pharmaceutical companies. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals gave $1 billion in contracts to big pharmaceutical companies and did not ensure that the vaccines needed to protect people against COVID-19 could be produced here in Canada. Canadians are having to wait even longer to get the vaccine because of the Liberals. As a result, more people are going to become ill and potentially die from COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404989">In the United States and the United Kingdom, vaccines will be available this week. However, in Canada, the only thing we know for sure is that we are receiving six million doses in March, which is enough for three million people. The problem is, that is not even enough to vaccinate everyone over 70. There are 4.5 million seniors in Canada over the age of 70, not to mention high-risk individuals such as health professionals, essential workers and indigenous peoples. The government must ensure that we have the capacity to make our own vaccines and essential medications for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404990">This pandemic has shown that we must not rely on production from other countries during emergencies. As a result of the Liberal government's lack of preparation, Canadians will have to wait even longer to get a COVID-19 vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404991">Past Conservative governments privatized labs and vaccine manufacturers, effectively preventing Canadians from having access to a vaccine and essential medications. Despite being in power for decades, Liberal governments have not restored this capacity to produce vaccines and medications here in Canada.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6404992">The fact is that the Liberal government has completely failed to lay out a plan. It does not have a plan to address the major question of the pandemic, which is about rolling out the vaccine. The Liberals are going to talk about the fact that they have the best access to vaccines and have some of the best plans, but they have not published their plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404993">Australia, a country very similar to Canada in resources and size, has the entire plan for its vaccine rollout on its website. The Liberals might say that they do not know which vaccine will be successful. Australia factored that in. It has included all potential scenarios. If one vaccine is successful, it has a plan; if another is successful, it has a plan. It talks about who will get it and when they will get it. That is what a government should do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404994">The Liberal government has completely failed to lay out a clear plan. There is no question about that. What is even worse is that the most we know about the plan the Liberal government is proposing is that the first round of vaccines, coming possibly in March, will only be enough to cover three million Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404995">We know, based on Canada's census, there are over four and a half million Canadian seniors over the age of 70. There is certainly not enough medication to cover all of the vulnerable seniors, let alone all of the front-line workers and the indigenous communities at high risk. What is the plan? This is a simple request that the government has failed to answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404996">It has failed to roll out a clear plan of when everyone will be vaccinated and who will be vaccinated. People want to know the answers to these questions. This will give hope to Canadians who are worried, who are wondering what is going to happen and what the future looks like. The fact that the government could not lay out a clear plan with clear details is a failure in leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404997">Another problem that we saw at the beginning of this pandemic was that we could not produce some of the most important essential equipment that we needed. It came to light that the protective equipment we needed to provide to our front-line workers was in short supply. We relied on a supply chain that was broken, and Canadians were not able to access protective equipment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404998">People were outraged that the 10th largest economy in the world did not have the ability to produce masks, gowns and sanitizers. I am very proud of the fact that Canadian companies mobilized and were able to turn that around and start producing these locally, but it is a clear failure in policy if a country is not able to produce the medical equipment it needs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6404999">What has become even more troubling is that we do not have the capacity, as the 10th largest economy in the world, to produce our own medications or vaccines. Here is where we have to be very clear about who is to blame. There is absolutely no question that Conservative governments in the past privatized our public companies, the companies owned by us that produced vaccines in Canada. Their policies effectively eliminated all the production capacity to make vaccines in Canada. That is their responsibility. By the same token, the Liberals were in power for decades and failed to restore our capacity to manufacture and produce vaccines and medications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405000">Let me give a really clear example, one that should startle people. One of the prides of Canada is the fact that Connaught, owned by Canadians, was where insulin was made. The medical breakthrough on insulin was made in Canada and we owned it. We created it and owned the ability to produce it, and we produced it at an affordable rate. As an example, which is not a public or private example but strictly Canada versus the U.S., one vial of insulin, the homologue version, costs $32 in Canada and $300 in the U.S.: 10 times the cost. People from the States come to Canada to get medications because they are so much more affordable here. We not only discovered but made insulin in Canada, and the Conservatives privatized Connaught.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405001">Connaught was also the key player in many vaccines that were discovered. In fact, the reason why Connaught was developed in the first place, and I am sure the irony will not be lost on members, is because a diphtheria outbreak meant that people needed a vaccine. Canada found that it was far too expensive to buy: private companies were charging too much, so it was decided to make it here in Canada. History has a habit of repeating itself. We are now faced with a pandemic, and we do not have the capacity to make the vaccine in our own country. We need to make it in our own country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405002">We need to be able to restore our capacity to make this here at home. We need to be able to make vaccines in Canada, so New Democrats are proposing the creation of a public Crown corporation: a company owned by us. Just as we own electricity and roads in many jurisdictions, we should own the ability to make vaccines and medications in our country. It is a question of sovereignty and the ability to protect our citizens. We are the 10th largest economy in the world and should absolutely be able to make critical, vital medications and vaccines in our own country. That is our proposition. To undo the wrongs of the Conservatives and the Liberals, we need to move forward and restore our ability to manufacture medications here in our own country.</ParaText>

We can Google it right now and find out exactly what is going on. The Canadian government has failed. There is no other way to put it. It has failed. We knew that vaccine delivery and production would be vital for us to get out of this pandemic. The fact that we cannot, right now, find out what that plan is, and that people clearly do not know what the plan is, what the doses are, which companies are involved, who is going to get vaccinated or when, or have answers to other basic questions, is very clearly a failure of leadership on the part of the Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405009">As he pointed out, it was the Conservative government in 1986, the Mulroney government, that privatized Connaught Labs, which had performed a valuable public health service to this country by producing essential vaccines and insulin for millions of Canadians. Of course, the Liberals have had 18 years in government since then, 16 of those in majority, to reverse that policy. Instead, both governments presided over the slide in Canada's pharmaceutical production capacity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405012">This would be vital. Members can imagine the outrage that Canadians felt when we could not produce basic masks, gowns and protective equipment. Canadians feel that same outrage right now. They think about the fact that a country as wealthy and as advanced as Canada cannot make vaccines and medication for its own population and the fact that, since we do not have capacity, we are going to have to wait until other countries produce for us to receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405013">The ability to make it here in Canada, and to have our own company where we can make medication and vaccines in Canada, would be life-changing. It would open up the door for us to have national universal pharmacare that is fully public. It would make it easier. It would make sure that millions of Canadians who are struggling with the cost of medication would not have to worry, and right now in this pandemic, it would have meant that we would have gotten through this more easily.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405017">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to the important motion introduced today by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>. I think I speak for all of us in the House when I say 2020 has been an incredibly challenging year, not only, of course profoundly, from a health point of view but also from an economic point of view. It is a fair comment to say 2020 has been unprecedented, really one year in a century, when it comes to the intersection of a public health crisis with a massive economic shock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405018">On a personal level, there has been incredible suffering and sacrifice by Canadians in every community in our country. Over 12,000 families have lost loved ones. There has been incredible isolation, with family members being separated and kept apart: children from their aged parents, sometimes spouses from partners and sometimes grandparents from grandchildren. Seniors have been left alone, isolated, sometimes in long-term care centres separated from their closest family members, and some have died alone without the comfort of family members around them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405019">We have had incredible job losses, income challenges and displacement, and the economic devastation many businesses have felt across this country is something that will be felt for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405020">However, there is hope. The global search for an effective vaccine is showing great promise. Along with a potential treatment, this is really the only way we will restore Canada to some semblance of normalcy. Hopefully that is a new normalcy that is better than the one it will replace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405021">Canadians across this country are awaiting access to a vaccine with excitement, anticipation and great optimism, but of course a vaccine has to be safe, effective and delivered as broadly and as swiftly as possible. To do this, not only parliamentarians but Canadians need transparency and information. In fact, the public is entitled to it. The public needs it. Besides it being a right for Canadians to have the most current, accurate information possible from their federal government, it is also critically important to allay fear and suspicion and to build trust and confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405022">The NDP has worked throughout the COVID pandemic to be a positive, constructive and evidence-based voice in Parliament and in our communities. We have one goal, and that is to help Canadians stay healthy and supported in the best way possible. Economically, the NDP has been responsible for at least a dozen improvements to support Canadians, ranging from increasing the CERB to $2,000 a month, to extending support to part-time and seasonal workers, and increasing the wage subsidy for small businesses to 75%. There are many other ways we worked hard and productively with the government to improve those supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405023">Regarding the health side of the equation and vaccines, what do we know right now about the government's response? First, we know the Liberal government has refused to make a single vaccine contract public. In fact, it voted against a motion in the House to disclose even redacted contracts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405024">Second, after promising Canadians in August that we would be able to manufacture vaccines in Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> admitted in November that we have no such capacity. Worse, he had to acknowledge that this meant Canadians would get vaccines later than citizens would in countries that are producing vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405025">Third, the Liberal government failed to negotiate in a single contract, of any of the seven contracts it signed with potential vaccine manufacturers, the right to produce a vaccine in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405026">Fourth, as of this day, December 3, we have no detailed vaccination plan that reveals how vaccinations will be administered, by whom, or who will have priority.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405027">Fifth, the government failed to receive promising vaccines on Canadian soil pending Health Canada approval, as Canadian law specifically allows and as is being done in other countries, like our neighbours to the south.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405028">Sixth, the best information that we have is that Canada has secured, at most, six million doses of vaccines by April, which is enough to vaccinate only three million Canadians or about 8% of the population of our country. As the leader of our party has pointed out, we have over four million Canadians over the age of 70, so that is not even enough to vaccinate every senior over the age of 70, who are obviously in a vulnerable position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405029">Seventh, to this day, we do not know when vaccines are expected to arrive, how they will be distributed, which province will get them and in what amounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405030">Eighth, we have no real date for herd immunity. We have a vague assurance by our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that he hopes to immunize 50% of the population by September, but we have absolutely no evidence or data to suggest why that date has been chosen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405031">I know that vaccine science is complex. I acknowledge that there are things that are not yet known. We agree that some plans must await Health Canada approval. However, let us compare how the current government performs, compared with other countries, to see what is actually possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405032">In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established a vaccine readiness date of November 15 with a 24-hour rollout. It released a 75-page playbook detailing everything, including vaccine provider recruitment, vaccine storage and priority groups. The U.S. has received Pfizer vaccine to pre-position it, pending FDA approval. I will pause there. FDA has not approved the Pfizer vaccine, just like Health Canada has not approved the Pfizer vaccine. That did not stop the United States from receiving the Pfizer vaccine and having it stored, so that if and when it is approved it can roll it out immediately. Canada has not done that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405033">The U.S. aims to vaccinate every American who wants it by June 1, 2021. In fact, its plan is to vaccinate 20 million Americans in December and 30 million Americans every single month, meaning the U.S. will have vaccinated 110 million people, or one-third of their population, by the time we have done 8%. Finally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. signed agreements with major pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens to assist with vaccinations in long-term care centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405034">I will turn to the U.K. It has already designated 1,250 local health clinics as vaccine sites, with targets for the number of vaccinations each week. The U.K.'s NHS has already started taking vaccine appointments, starting with long-term care residents, those over 80 and health and social workers.

              <ParaText id="6405035">In Germany, the health minister has asked states to have vaccination centres ready by mid-December and had a national vaccination strategy ready by early November. In Australia, the government has a 12-page vaccination plan released and there are 30 million AstraZeneca doses being manufactured in that country. Brazil, India, Japan, Indonesia, China, Russia, Australia, Belgium and many other countries are producing vaccines in their countries. In Canada, our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says we cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405036">What do we need? We need action and transparency. We need a detailed strategy and timeline for vaccinations. This does not need to be delayed until Health Canada's approval. It can and must be decided and released now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405037">Canadians deserve to know when the first doses will arrive, who will get vaccinated first, how vaccinations will be delivered and when they will be available to every Canadian. We would like the government to release at least basic details of our vaccine contracts. After all, Canadians paid for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405038">Finally, we want to establish a public drug and vaccine manufacturer, a Crown corporation, to fix Canada's unacceptable vulnerability, so that never again will Canada have to wait for China or the United States to deliver essential medical equipment, supplies, medicine or vaccines to Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405043">It is an excellent question. As I referred to in my speech, to gain public confidence and allay fears and suspicions requires transparency and information from this federal government. I must say that other than the Liberals saying that they have the best portfolio is the world and to just trust them, they have been remarkably reluctant to release basic information. Frankly, I do not understand it. These are not state secrets. Nobody is asking for detailed commercial information. What we are asking for is the basic information that is necessary for the Canadian public to have confidence that there is a way out of this crisis, and that they will get access to a safe and effective vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405044">For instance, like the disease of addiction, it is often said that the sickness is in the secrets. When we have secrets and a lack of transparency, it leads to anxiety, suspicion and false information. That cannot be good for the Canadian public. I cannot be good for Canadians' mental health. That is why I think that the Conservative motion today is very helpful in helping to allay those concerns. </ParaText>

There are experts and civil servants on a vaccination committee who have done their homework to ensure that Canadians will be well served with a vaccination.

              <ParaText id="6405049">Mr. Speaker, first, to clarify for the member, what I said was that we are not looking for detailed commercial and sensitive information from the contracts. We just want the basic details that Canadians want to know. When will the vaccines come? How many vaccines will be administered in January, February and March? Who is going to do the vaccinating? What are the priority groups? To this day, December 3, there is not a document from this federal government that says conclusively what the priority order of target populations to be vaccinated is. That is unacceptable on December 3, if we are going to be starting to vaccinate in early January.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405050">To speak to the member's other point, Canada is not unique. The United States has a federal government with many states and many complex administrative relationships. Australia is a country very similar to Canada. It is a mid-sized country with a federal government and states just like Canada. Those countries are producing vaccines domestically. They are releasing detailed vaccination plans. They are telling the population what the details are.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405052">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252522" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405053">I am pleased to rise today in the House to speak to our motion. It is an important one, but it would not have been moved if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government had just answered the questions that the opposition parties have been asking for weeks and even months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405054">Canadians are worried, and we are too. We are worried about the virus and the pandemic, but we are also worried about how this government is handling it. I will name just a few examples of this government's poor management since the beginning of the pandemic. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> allowed our pandemic alert system to be shut down just a few months before the outbreak of COVID-19. The government sent hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and gowns from Canada's main stockpile to China. A month later, health care professionals and first responders were asking us to ration our PPE because our supplies were running out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405055">I was a member of the emergency health committee that was struck in January, and we were already talking about the importance of restricting entry at the border. At that time, we were told that there was no problem and that everything was fine. There were all those questions, and then there was also a lot of dithering around masks. At the time, the Minister of Health even said the risk was low. Everything was managed very incompetently. It must be said that all the opposition parties raised good points and proposed solutions at various committees and here in the House. We were not there to cause conflict with the government. We were there to try to protect Canadians and prevent the virus from having a negative impact on their health and our economy. Most of the time, however, our proposals were rejected out of hand on the grounds that we did not know anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405056">Now we have very urgent questions about the infamous plan that everyone has been talking about since this morning. We know that there is no way of knowing the exact date. People in the media are asking questions, but we do not know the exact date. However, just because we do not have an exact date does not mean that the government cannot put a plan in place. It could develop a plan that includes phases and a model that could be applied. The plan could explain what will happen as of the first day approval is received from Health Canada. It could explain how the vaccine will be distributed, who will get it first, where people will be vaccinated and how. Canadians deserve answers from the government to those kinds of simple questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405057">This week, I watched a report on Radio-Canada about the situation in Germany. Germans are known for their precision. Just think of German cars and German technology. Germans are very detail-oriented, and their government lived up to that reputation by preparing a plan. The Germans also do not know the date when they will get the vaccine. They do not know that yet, but they know exactly where and when those vaccines will be distributed. What is more, they know that it will take less than two minutes to vaccinate each German citizen. That is how detailed their plan is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405058">Other countries like France and Great Britain are starting to administer vaccines and have already told their citizens what to do. We do not understand why, here in Canada, all we are told is that we have the best vaccine portfolio in the world. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told the House that other countries were envious and wondered why Canada had ordered so many. The Prime Minister is saying that we have 10 doses of vaccine per person. That is a talking point that was invented to get him out of trouble. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405059"> The former <Affiliation DbId="252947" Type="2">environment minister</Affiliation> was once filmed in a bar telling people around her that, in the House of Commons, if you keep repeating the same thing, people will eventually believe it is true, and it really drills your message into the collective consciousness. For weeks now, the Minister of Health and the Prime Minister have been telling us that Canada has the biggest and best vaccine portfolio in the world. That is what the government wants to put into everyone's head. In the army, that is called a psychological operation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405060"> Psychological operations, or psy-ops, are campaigns conducted by various countries to influence their citizens. We recently found out that the government wanted to create a psy-op cell here in Canada to influence Canadians. It was lucky that we found out, because the idea was dropped. That is serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405061">No one is here to score political points. We are in the middle of a global pandemic. Economies have ground to a halt. Back home in Quebec, restaurants and gyms have closed. Stores are even being forced to tighten their rules. People are being asked to stay home, and if the trend continues, they might not be able to see each other at Christmas. There is nothing funny about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405062">As I mentioned, we are not here to score political points. We are not trying to win anyone's vote in the next election. We want to solve the problem. The people, our constituents and our voters are asking every party for answers, and indirectly, the provincial premiers, who have the heavy responsibility of managing their citizens, are also asking us for answers. The Quebec premier and his government are the ones having to establish rules, and he is being lambasted by people who are understandably upset, fed up and exhausted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405063">The federal government has the major national responsibility of providing the best information available. We need this information, and it has to be accurate. If the government says that it signed the vaccine agreement later than expected and that it will receive the vaccine on February 1, we will do what we must to get through the next two months knowing that we will get the vaccine on February 1. The government really does not want to provide that information, because it does not want to suffer a political backlash now and be told that it was too slow and mismanaged its contracts and agreements, so we are going to have to suffer longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405064"> This reminds me of a speech I made recently about courage. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government will eventually need to muster the courage to tell it like it is. Canadians are not dumb. People want to know what to expect so that they can act accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405065">When the public is left in the dark, that is when we start to hear alternative theories, like conspiracy theories. That starts when people do not know what is going on. However, the government does not seem interested in communicating information, other than repeating that it has the biggest vaccine portfolio in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405066">Judging from what the Prime Minister says, it sounds as though we could vaccinate about 40 countries, but that is not what we need. There are 38 million Canadians, so we need 76 million doses to vaccinate everyone. It is as simple as that. We want to know exactly when we will get the vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405067">The government might not know the exact date, but I am sure it has a pretty good idea. We know that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, is about to approve the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and Health Canada has already said it would follow suit, so that will obviously happen sometime in the next two weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405068">However, we know the Americans signed their contract on August 5 and gave Pfizer $1.9 billion U.S. to reserve the first 100 million doses, which will then be distributed across the U.S. It is right there in black and white in the contract and in the U.S. government's official documents. They also asked Pfizer to distribute the vaccines on the ground itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405069"> Obviously, the Americans will get Pfizer's first 100 million doses. That is why we are waiting in line. We say that and the Liberals tell us it is not true, but facts like that confirm it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405070">What I am asking of the government today, December 3, is that it provide us with a clear plan explaining exactly what is going to happen after the holidays. It needs to give us a date, whether it be January 15 or February 1, for example, so that the provinces can make arrangements accordingly and so Canadians know that, unfortunately, they will have to wait. This could have been done better, but on the political side, evaluating the government's performance will come later. What we need right now is a plan so we can see where we are headed at this very moment. That is what Canadians and everyone else are waiting for.</ParaText>

They are concerned that, with the COVID-19 pandemic threatening their key fire and emergency medical service response, the risk of exposure is much higher for firefighters than the general population since they provide emergency medical response as part of their duties. Right now they are urging the government to ensure that firefighters, as emergency health care providers, are included in a priority group for health care workers for the available COVID-19 vaccines so they can get enough to ensure firefighters are healthy and remain available for duty in order to protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405087">This did not happen during H1N1. Unfortunately, firefighters were not included in the same group as health care workers then.

              <ParaText id="6405093">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to talk about this very important issue. I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for bringing this motion forward today, as we try to get some answers that Canadians desperately want to know about what is happening in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. I thank our shadow minister for health as well, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, for her incredible advocacy on behalf of all Canadians in trying to find out exactly what the government's plan is to make sure that we get vaccines in our arms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405094">In my speech today, I want to talk about the involvement of the Canadian Armed Forces in all this and why they have been brought in at the very last minute. Really, this is a public health issue that should be handled through the Public Health Agency of Canada, but because of a lack of leadership from the Liberal government, we now have, in the final minutes, a call-in-the-army scenario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405095">There is no doubt that the Canadian Armed Forces are an amazing organization with some of the best and brightest men and women in the country. They have a motto, which they pretty much live by: Failure is not an option. I can therefore see why we are so attracted to making use of their expertise, logistical capabilities, kit and equipment, and their ability to move personnel, products and all sorts of different materiel across the country. We know they have the greatest Canadians working for them, so we first and foremost salute them for their incredible service. However, unfortunately, they are being brought in to clean up the Liberal government's mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405096">How did we get to this point where the government could not figure out how to get vaccines rolled out across the country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405097">We need to work with our provincial and territorial partners to ensure vaccines are in place in communities to make sure we get treated and cured so we will not have this virus any longer and can get back to opening up our economy. Instead of having people locked down, we should get back to business and back to our jobs. That is what Canadians are asking for, but they are not seeing any leadership from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405098">We learned in the news this morning that there is a directive from the chief of the defence staff. The operation the military will be doing on behalf of the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Liberal government is called Operation Vector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405099">The document itself brings to light a lot of the information we have been asking for. It shows there will only be three million doses of vaccines available in the first quarter of 2021, so only three million Canadians are going to be administered the vaccine. We see through the planning that the government does not expect all Canadians to be vaccinated until the end of 2021. It will be 13 months from now before every Canadian is vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405100">We know the government is trying to plan out how to deal with the challenges the Canadian Armed Forces have to deal with, but how are they going to be out there deploying troops and equipment and making sure we are moving the vaccines in a timely manner? They are very sensitive and need to be in super freezers and kept under 70°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405101">Furthermore, how is the government going to manage the rollout of the vaccine while dealing with Operation Laser? It has the Canadian Armed Forces backfilling in personal care homes and long-term care institutions across the country to care for our loved ones and our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405102">How is the government going to deal with Operation LENTUS? It is a domestic operation by the Canadian Armed Forces that supports emergency measures at the provincial level regarding forest fires, floods and ice storms. We never know if there is going to be an earthquake or a hurricane, but they are called in often to provide a backstop to the provinces when volunteers get tired out on the front lines and when first responders can no longer keep up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405103">We have a number of international obligations as well: Operation Impact in Iraq; Operation Unifier in Ukraine; the enhanced forward presence initiative in Latvia, a NATO mission; and NATO staffing on missions across the globe, including the maritime task force that ensures we always have at least one or two of our frigates in patrol in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea. There is personnel required to do these roles, yet the government has decided to throw even more work at them to try to cover up its mistakes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405104">The other good part that came out of the CDS report was that they were going through the hard planning now. This only started on November 27. They will plan to be ready to start handling vaccines by the end of this month, December 31. However, they still have a lot of questions and they need answers from the government, just like opposition members have been asking the government. When are the vaccines going to show up? Who are going to be the suppliers? What are the logistic capabilities? Who is going to procure or contract the private logistics team that is familiar enough and capable enough to deal with vaccines in this type of format?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405105">We are still sitting here. We were expecting the Canadian Armed Forces to come up with a plan, but it cannot finish its plan until the Liberals answer some questions. That is what they keep refusing to do. They have been dithering, delaying and been completely undecided for months now. We have been dealing with this since March, when we were in lockdown. We knew about this virus back in December 2019. Here we are 12 months later and the Liberals still cannot answer the critical questions we need to ensure that vaccines get into the arms of Canadians safely and timely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405106">We keep hearing the Liberals say that they have been working with the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces for months planning this. We had government officials at both the public accounts committee and the national defence committee only a couple of weeks ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405107"> On November 19, General Cadieu, the director of staff of the Strategic Joint Staff, was before the committee. I asked him if there was a named operation for rolling out vaccines. He said there was not, that it would be happening under Operation Laser. Two weeks later and we have a name, Operation Vector. He did not know about it because this was made up in the last few days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405108">We asked if National Defence was procuring super freezers so they could help with the distribution. They were not. Deputy Minister Jody Thomas said that they were looking at some storage capability, but that was for internal Canadian Armed Forces use when we got to the point of vaccinating our own troops. Again, they did not know they would have to buy super freezers until just recently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405109">General Dany Fortin is now the commanding officer of Operation Vector and is in charge of it on behalf of the whole of government. He has great credentials. In his comments to the national defence committee, he said that the CDS and deputy minister would give directions to the CAF and the Department of National Defence to adopt robust risk mitigation, protect the force and stand ready to conduct operations in support of their nation. They are standing ready, but still no direction. That was on November 20. He said that if the requirement came from Public Safety and the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> considered they needed to be prepared, then the chief of the defence staff would give his best advice possible. Again, no advice was given by November 20.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405110">Then we have discovered this morning that the chief of the defence staff's strategic directive on Operation Vector, November 27. This just came out. I want to point out page 3. This is what the Canadian Armed Forces are expecting:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405139">Our goal is to ensure early access to diverse portfolios of vaccines so Canada is well positioned to receive doses of safe and effective vaccines early. That is precisely what we are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405140">Our government has negotiated agreements with the manufacturers of seven promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This work is complex and is taking place at rapid speed in a highly competitive global marketplace.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405143">In order to move forward as quickly as possible, in the initial phases, the majority of our agreements with suppliers of potential vaccines were agreements in principle. We began signing these agreements in July. This guaranteed doses from vaccine suppliers while we were negotiating details for a final purchase agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405144">Today I can announce that we have agreements with six of seven vaccine suppliers: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Sanofi—GSK and the flagship of Quebec industry, Medicago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405145">Negotiations on a final agreement with Novavax are going well and should be concluded soon. With these seven agreements, Canadians will have access to at least 194 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. These agreements also give us the possibility of buying up to 220 million additional doses. This ultimately means that we have the possibility of getting more than 400 million doses for Canadians, as well as 15 million additional doses through the COVAX global initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405146">Regardless of what the opposition members are saying—and I have heard all kinds of outrageous things—our government has signed a record number of agreements with potential vaccine manufacturers.

              <ParaText id="6405147">Earlier this week, Noubar Afeyan, the co-founder and chairman of Moderna, which is producing one of the most promising vaccines, said unequivocally that not only is Canada not last, but that it was one of the first countries to pre-order the Moderna vaccine. More importantly, he said that Canada is guaranteed to receive a certain portion of the company's initial batch of vaccine, subject to all required approvals, of course.</ParaText>

That is what we have been saying for some time and that is what remains the case. What we need to understand is that timelines for delivery for each candidate are dependent on the company's clinical trials timeline and results, and of course, regulatory filings and regulatory approvals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405149">Before it can be received, delivered and administered to Canadians, any vaccine candidate must first receive Health Canada's authorization. It is a gold standard in authorization, and I once again thank the professionals who have been working overtime at Health Canada. I would like to think that all members of this House would agree that, in all that we do, we must put the safety of Canadians first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405150">We have seen some promising news lately and we anticipate approval of some of the more advanced vaccines, such as those from Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, to happen shortly. Once they are approved, deliveries will start as soon as possible. </ParaText>

Our government is working to ensure that items such as needles, syringes and freezers are available and ready for shipment as soon as manufacturers are ready to ship vaccines, and we are making significant progress in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405152">I can confirm that we have received enough of those supplies to administer nearly 25 million doses of vaccine, and more supplies will arrive every month. Our government is also seeking a logistics service provider to ensure the efficient distribution of vaccines to Canadians, including transportation and storage. At the same time, we have purchased and received several freezers that can operate at extremely cold temperatures to store vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405153">We launched a competitive procurement process for the purchase of dry ice in order to ensure the proper distribution and storage of the vaccine across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405154">The time has come for Canadians to unite, as they did at the beginning of the pandemic to flatten the curve. Effective immunization against COVID-19 will be one of the greatest achievements in the history of this country. Even though this will not be accomplished overnight, there is now an end in sight to this pandemic. Our government laid the groundwork, and we know that it is only by working with others and mobilizing all of our resources that we will succeed. We are already working with the provinces and territories on the subsequent distribution of vaccines throughout the country and we will ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces play a visible and important role in that distribution.</ParaText>

There are 40,000 people in my community who work in that sector, and 4,000 of those are in the two casinos alone. Those employees have not been back to work since March.

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253809" Type="18">Mr. Adam van Koeverden (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth and to the Minister of Canadian Heritage (Sport), Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6405172">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the House and speak to this government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of procuring safe and effective vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405173">As winter approaches and the number of COVID-19 cases reach record highs in most regions of the country, Canadians are becoming more and more concerned about how their families and communities will make it through the next few months while remaining safe, secure and healthy. Our government has been focused on containing the spread of COVID-19 since the very beginning of this pandemic, and I am sure that all members of this House can agree that this has been our most pressing mutual priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405174">Public Services and Procurement Canada has a role to play by procuring personal protective equipment, and our government is ensuring this equipment is getting to our front-line health care workers and other essential workers. However, the long-term solution has been and remains to be having safe and effective vaccines, and ensuring all Canadians will have access to it. In that regard, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said recently, there is light at the end of the tunnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405175">Much of that hope is based on the potential vaccines on the horizon, and Public Services and Procurement Canada, as the government's central purchaser, has been leading the process of securing access to vaccine candidates. Today we have the most diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates in the world, with access to more doses per person than any other country, and this did not happen by accident. It took the hard work of public servants, and science-based approaches, to be in this enviable position. This government is determined to continue this work as long as we need it, until this pandemic is finally over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405176">As Canada formulated its process for securing vaccines, we have been guided by the COVID-19 vaccine task force. The members of this task force include leading vaccine and immunology experts, and industry leaders in Canada. These experts have been giving us the best scientific and technical advice available on major vaccine candidates, including which ones were the most advanced in their trials and, more importantly, which ones would be the safest and the most effective for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405177">Our government took that advice and began engaging with the leading COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in the summer. Right away, we began complex negotiations to secure access to vaccine candidates by signing agreements with these manufacturers. We had the first agreement with Moderna in place in July, and the others have followed. Through continued negotiation with manufacturers, the government has agreements in place with seven manufacturers: Moderna, Sanofi, GSK, Pfizer, Medicago, AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405178">Altogether, these seven agreements will give Canada access to 194 million doses. These agreements also provide Canada with options to purchase up to 220 million additional doses. On top of this, we have access to 15 million additional doses through the international COVAX initiative. This means that we have the potential to access up to 429 million doses, and that will give us the flexibility to make future decisions, once we know which vaccines will be the best options for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405179">It is an affront to our hard-working public services workers to say we did not work hard enough or fast enough to procure these vaccines. I can assure members that these procurement officers work day and night to ensure that Canadians would have a vaccine as soon as possible. The Conservatives are clearly more concerned with their own narrative than they are of the health and safety of Canadians. Thankfully, our public service workers have Canadians' health top of mind when negotiating contracts with potential vaccine suppliers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405180">I am sure Canadians understand that such agreements come with complex terms and conditions because of the global growing demand and the limited supply of these vaccines. However, unlike what many members opposite have been putting forward in recent days, Canada is far from being last in line to receive vaccines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405181">In fact, it was validated recently by the co-founder and chairman of Moderna that we are very close to the front of the line, but instead of providing support in this time of extraordinary need, the Conservatives would rather sow doubt and confusion. On this side of the House, we believe in working together and propping up our hard-working public service instead of putting it down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405182">Members from the Conservative Party have been comparing the COVID-19 pandemic to the seasonal flu on the radio. Members of the Conservative Party have been shamelessly minimizing the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Alberta, and then just recently a member of the Conservative Party sponsored an anti-vax petition, signed by 22,000 people who do not believe in vaccines. The sponsoring member, when questioned, said that the petition raised some really good points. People in my riding rely on our elected representatives for good, timely and reliable information, not this misinformation, this anti-science rhetoric that has been all too common coming from the Conservative caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405183">As the House knows, an effective vaccine is the path forward for Canada and the way out of this pandemic for the world over. Canada has laid the foundation for deployment of a vaccine from coast to coast to coast. We have a thorough, diverse and large portfolio of vaccines, and we are in a great position. Of course, any vaccine candidate must first receive Health Canada's authorization and be proven to be safe and effective before it can be administered to Canadians. Once those approvals are in place, we expect to have the first deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines arriving in the first quarter of 2021, which, I note for the members opposite, is essentially the same timeline as many other countries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405184">As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, once a vaccine is ready, Canada will be ready. As the deliveries of approved vaccines arrive, the Public Health Agency of Canada will be on hand to distribute them to provincial and territorial health authorities; and, we look forward to the contribution of Major-General Dany Fortin in leading the logistics of getting vaccines into the arms of Canadians ASAP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405185">However, it is not enough just to have vaccines delivered. I would like to remind the House that we do in fact have a plan for distribution and administration. PSPC has been working to ensure that access to these critical goods and services that are needed to administer vaccines are on hand as well, and ready to go as soon as manufacturers are ready to ship vaccines. In fact, this government began procuring supplies such as needles and syringes over this past summer. We now have enough of these supplies to administer nearly 25 million doses of the vaccines, and more supplies are arriving every month. As well, PSPC has been working with the Public Health Agency of Canada on a competitive process to engage logistics services to ensure that vaccines can be transported, stored and effectively distributed to Canadians. Those contracts are set to be in place in the coming days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405186">We are working to ensure that vaccines can be stored at the correct temperature so that they can remain effective up until the time that they are administered. That is why we have purchased 26 freezers with -80°C capability and 100 freezers that can operate at -20°C to store these vaccines. Some of those have already been delivered, and we will also be purchasing additional freezers very soon. In addition, we plan to purchase dry ice for distributing and storing vaccine doses across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405187"> At each step, we will coordinate our efforts with the provinces and territories to bring safe and effective vaccines to all Canadians. We will not cease in our efforts until we can ensure that, when a vaccine is ready, Canada will be ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405188">I will close by reiterating how important it is that we continue to do our hard work in ending this pandemic, just as we have asked all Canadians to do their part in slowing the spread of this coronavirus. Canadians have always been able to withstand our winters because we know that spring is just around the corner. This government wants to ensure that our fellow citizens can maintain that resolve and that hope. Through our efforts in negotiating and planning and keeping Canadians informed about the true progress we have been making, we will get ever closer to ending this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405189">I ask all members in this House to be a part of this solution, and end the misinformation for the good of all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405209">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to rise to speak to this important issue today. I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252868" Type="2">Battlefords—Lloydminster</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405210">I am pleased to rise after the member for <Affiliation DbId="252930" Type="2">Milton</Affiliation> so I can correct the numerous amounts of misinformation we just heard in his speech, which was written by an expert, I am sure, in the Prime Minister's Office. He talked about how the government has been so great at providing information, and how it has led the world in its response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405211">This is a government has been wrong or late every single step of the way, and it has resulted in pain, suffering and even death for Canadians. The Liberals were late to close the border, weeks behind other nations, like Australia, which saw the pandemic coming, which did not rely on information coming out of other countries, like China, but relied on its own experts, something the Liberal government did not have the opportunity to do because it had shut down the early pandemic warning system months before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405212">The Liberal government destroyed PPE that we could have used, and it shipped PPE off to China when we desperately needed it here at home, leaving us short-handed. It gave bad advice on masks. They told us at the beginning not to use a mask, and that it was more dangerous to use a mask than to not wear one. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> said that COVID-19 does not spread person to person, and that if we wanted to close the border, then we were actually racist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405213">This was the rhetoric that was coming out of the government. It is no surprise that Canadians have no confidence in what the government is putting forward now, and when they see the government now saying “Just trust us, we have your best interests at heart”, it is a little hard to take when every piece of advice that has been given for the last 10 months has either been wrong or late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405214">The Liberal government was wrong on the border. It was late on rapid tests. It has been, quite frankly, incompetent during the period between the two waves. We are no further ahead now than we were back in March, when we locked everything down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405215">
                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> It is a good thing we legalized it for you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405216">
                <B>Mr. Mark Strahl:</B> He will get his chance. That member always does get a chance to speak, even though he wants to heckle when we are talking about something this important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405217">The Liberals want to be patted on the back when all we have seen is incompetence and failure. That failure, quite frankly, has a grave impact on some of our most vulnerable citizens. Twelve months ago, the military alerted the cabinet that this pandemic was occurring in China. Ten months ago, we had a major shutdown of our economy, because we did not really know much about COVID-19 and we needed to take that step at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405218">Now, we find ourselves, 10 months later, still facing the same restrictions. This is particularly acute in long-term care facilities. It is heartbreaking. It is tragic, what is happening to our seniors in long-term care. We saw this early on, the devastating impact that COVID-19 had in long-term care. The government has tried to react to it by locking seniors away in their own bedrooms for months at a time. This has been the response, locking seniors away from their loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405219">This is why this is so critical, when we talk about the importance of rolling out a vaccine now, when other peer countries are doing it. It is because that will allow us access, once again, to our family members in long-term care, who have been locked away, who have been suffering mental anguish and physical suffering. They are being told that while people they know in the United States, Australia, Brazil, and going down the list, 2.7 billion in countries that will have access to a vaccine before we do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405220">Why does it matter? It matters that we are not getting it now, we will get it months from now. A lot of these people do not have a lot of time left. That is the tragic reality here. They are being locked away from their families and the people they love at a time when they need them the most. That is why I am upset about it. It is not because I am looking to score political points here. It is because we are 10 months past the start of this, and we are no further ahead. People are no closer to being able to go see their aged parents or grandparents. They are locked away.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405221">Then an outbreak comes to their long-term care facility and maybe they die alone or can FaceTime their family, instead of their being able to hold their hands at the end. That is why every day matters. That is why this delay matters. That is why putting all of our eggs into one basket at the start of this matters. We are taking months and time away from people who do not have a lot of time left. That is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405222">People can get money. We have supported the supports given to Canadians who have lost their incomes, business opportunities or have had to shut down again, and for much longer, because there will be no viable vaccine here in Canada after other countries get it. We cannot give people $2,000 a month and have it make up for lost time. We cannot put a price on lost time. That is what we are talking about here today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405223">The government wants us to believe it has a diverse portfolio of vaccines available, but just not now, while other countries are rolling out their vaccines. Other countries are being very open on the dates the vaccine will be available, how it will be deployed, who will get it first and how they will determine which people need it the most. What we get from the government is that we should trust it. It was going to be the most open and transparent government in Canadian history. It got an A for announcement and an F for delivery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405224"> Time and time again, every opposition day motion that is brought to the House is a requirement for the government to share information with Canadians, because it will not give it to us. It is hard to believe the government is giving us good information when it is giving us no information. The Government of Australia published its distribution plan on its website for all of its citizens to see. The government loves to compare itself with Donald Trump, as though that is some sort of bar it is very proud to have beaten. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405225">We want to be better than that. We should be looking to other countries that have done much better in similar situations to us, those that have responded in a way that will allow their senior citizens in long-term care facilities to see their kids and grandkids, that will allow their families to be reunited and that will allow people of faith to once again gather together in corporate worship, something that is so important and integral to who they are. We should be doing all of this, yet we delay month after month. By the government's own admission, the first quarter of this year will only see three million doses available. That does not even cover our over 70 population let alone other vulnerable Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405226">Once again we are asking for information so Canadians will know when they can receive the vaccine if they want to get it. The government should have that information, although it seems like there is a bit of a back-of-the-napkin approach. We heard today that two weeks ago the military did not know it would be involved in this and now it has stood up a rapid deployment force. That is fantastic. The military will always do what it is called upon to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405227">However, this is something the government has been late on because it made bad decisions at the outset. Instead of focusing like a laser on this issue, it was focused on getting money to Liberal-connected firms. It was focused on the WE Charity scandal and getting money to people with connections to the Liberal Party. It has been focused the entire time on the wrong things and has given Canadians the wrong information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405228">The government does not like to hear that and wonders why it is helpful to be reminded of it. It is helpful because this is how we got here. This is why we are not where some of the other Commonwealth countries we would compare ourselves to are today. We are behind the eight ball. What do we do now? We need to get the information to the provinces, which will deploy the vaccine when they know how many doses they will get and who they will be giving the vaccine to. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405229">For too long the government has taken the wrong approach. It is time it started to give Canadians the information they need so that we can get our lives back and get our families back together, something that we have been waiting for too long to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405235">Madam Speaker, I note that the motion today essentially just calls for the government to provide an update to Canadians on December 16 of some very basic information. I want to contrast that with what is happening in the U.K. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405236">The National Health Service has designated 1,250 local health clinics as vaccine sites, where staff will be on hand to administer the vaccine over 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, and it has specified that each clinic is expected to inoculate at least 975 people per week. They have already started booking vaccine appointments, designating blocks of priority groups and have identified the priority groups: those in long-term care homes, those over 80 years of age and health care and social care workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405237">I am wondering if my hon. colleague can comment on that.

              <ParaText id="6405240">Madam Speaker, in thinking about vaccines, I looked at Canada's history. I think about what happened in our experience with polio, in particular. With the first child passing away in 1910, we had a vaccine from Salk in 1955 and again from Sabin in 1962. It resulted in continuous waves, until eventually it was brought under control in the 1970s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405241">There are three things we can learn from this experience. Number one is how incredible it is to have domestic production of vaccines in Canada. Number two is that the adoption of the vaccine was slow and uneven, so we do in fact need a plan and we need to combat misinformation. Number three is that the idea that we can call a vaccine a silver bullet needs to be combatted because, long after even the initial vaccine is given to our most vulnerable, there will still be the need for increased health protection measures for some time to come.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6405244">Madam Speaker, this year Canadians have been faced with much adversity. Our seniors have been particularly hard hit, and today we are asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government to give them confidence that their government has a plan. We are asking the government to be honest and clear with them and to demonstrate it has the competence to navigate them through this pandemic. They deserve as much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405245">This week's fall economic statement was an opportunity to do just that, but it did not offer Canadians a clear plan on vaccines or even a clear plan for testing in the meantime. In fact, the government has had the opportunity to offer Canadians that assurance every time it is asked for a plan. Instead, it responds every time with the same non-answers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405246">The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> was not pleased when I asked her if seniors would have to wait until September 2021 to see their grandchildren again. The reality is that the government has not provided Canadians with that answer. There is no readily available plan on when vulnerable populations will have access to a vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405247"> The Liberal government cannot expect us to offer it blind trust because it certainly has not earned it, not when the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> allowed our pandemic early warning system to be shut down just months before the pandemic, not when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sent hundreds of thousands of personal protective equipment from our reserves to China only to leave our front-line health care workers without, and not when the government refused to close our borders, allowing the virus to spread, flip-flopped on mask use or delayed on approving rapid tests. These failures have not earned the government the trust of Canadians, so it should understand why we are asking for a vaccine rollout plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405248">Still without adequate access to rapid tests, Canadians are missing an important tool to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Testing is crucial to treating and isolating COVID. The government delayed approvals to rapid testing and now Liberals proudly stand in the House to tell us they have delivered rapid tests to the provinces. Those numbers are wholly inadequate. Those numbers are not anywhere in the vicinity of what is needed to be effective. Regular and mass testing would be a game-changer for our seniors, vulnerable populations, front-line health care workers, essential workers and all Canadians. It has the potential to significantly safeguard our long-term care homes, which have been the hardest hit by this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405249">The Canadian Institute for Health Information did a comparison in the spring of the impact of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in OECD countries. In that report, Canada had the highest proportion of deaths occurring in long-term care. Fatalities in long-term care accounted for around 81% of COVID deaths in Canada compared with an OECD average of only 38%. Those numbers are shameful. We have to better protect our seniors in care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405250">Now well into the second wave, the majority of deaths in Canada continue to be in long-term care homes and outbreaks in care continue to be on the rise. It is absolutely shameful that we do not at least have adequate access to rapid tests in our tool belt. Rapid tests could help isolate COVID in these homes and even help prevent outbreaks in the first place. To do that effectively though, we need rapid tests to be readily available. We are just not there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405251">Long-term care residents, their families and the workers who care for them deserve better. Supports for them are needed in the immediate term. Staff in long-term care need access to PPE and resources to do their jobs. As well, the staffing crisis in long-term care needs serious attention and not just a band-aid solution. We need a plan for family reunification. Some of our seniors have been physically and socially isolated for months on end, separated from their loved ones, friends and in some cases from their neighbours down the hall. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405252">Last night during the debate on the government's bill on medically assisted death, I talked about Nancy Russell, a senior who reportedly opted for medically assisted death instead of facing another lonely and isolated lockdown in her care home. Her story is truly heartbreaking. I have no doubt that she is not the only Canadian to experience feelings of loneliness in the face of COVID. We cannot expect our seniors and our vulnerable populations to endlessly isolate from their loved ones. They have already missed birthdays, holidays and many important gatherings. We have to be aware of the serious mental health toll this pandemic is having on our seniors, our vulnerable populations and, in essence, all Canadians. We need to offer our seniors hope. All Canadians need hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405253">At the outset of this pandemic, the government talked about temporary restrictions and lockdowns to help buy time. Now, more than 11 months after we first heard about COVID, there has to be a better response. We know that mass testing is key to isolating COVID infections, and that the delivery of a safe and effective vaccine will be the real light at the end of the tunnel. We know that a safe and effective vaccine will also be vital to our economic recovery. It is certainly not unreasonable for us to expect the government to have a plan, to tell Canadians who want a vaccine when they can expect to receive one that is safe and effective, and how many doses each province will be receiving, or to be clear on the details of negotiated contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405254"> We are hearing reports and details from other countries on their vaccine delivery plans and timelines. Other countries are starting to roll out a vaccine in the coming weeks, and we still do not even have a clear plan, or have not heard of a clear plan. The United States and Britain are talking about mass access to the vaccine in December and January. December is here, and now our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is throwing around September. He needs to tell Canadians why this is, and what the plan is between now and then. It is not just opposition members asking for clarity. Team Canada is asking. Canadians are asking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405255">The provincial premiers, who will be tasked with delivering the vaccine, are asking for clarity. Premier Scott Moe, from my home province of Saskatchewan, has said that he is concerned and troubled to hear that Canada is at the back of the line when it comes to receiving a vaccine. The premier has said that he has not received confirmation from the federal government that a vaccine will be distributed on a per-capita basis, nor has he received clarity on when it will be received by the provinces.

A report from the Canadian Mental Health Association that came out this morning had stats that I think all of us in this room would agree are soaring. More than 40% of Canadians surveyed have said that their mental health has deteriorated since March, while 18% of Canadians have had suicidal thoughts and 13% of parents have said they are worried about domestic violence and abuse. These are frightening numbers. A lot of that mental health deterioration is because Canadians do not have answers to important questions. They want to know. They want hope.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405273">Madam Speaker, mental health is actually something that is definitely being overlooked, especially when we tell people they need to stay in their homes. I just spoke about Nancy Russell, who wanted to die. She died. She followed through with her MAID because she did not want to be lonely. She did not want to be locked alone in her long-term care facility in her residence with nobody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405274">Humans were created for relationships and interaction with other humans. The government said it needed everybody to lockdown so we could have time. We needed to buy time, and then we saw some six weeks thrown away because there was a scandal that government was a part of, which was absolutely ridiculous. The government needs to be transparent with Canadians so they feel less anxious and have less anxiety.</ParaText>

They employ 70% of the total private labour force in Canada. These are incredible statistics that show the tremendous contribution to our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405316"> It is clear that small businesses are the engine and the heart of our economy. Hopefully all governments across the country remember these statistics as they make policy decisions that impact small businesses, especially now during the pandemic. Let us help them get through this pandemic, not close them while multi-billion dollar chains stay open. At the end of the day, the success of small businesses is clearly vital to Canada's prosperity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405323"> We should consider that while Winnipeg food banks have seen a 30% increase in demand since the pandemic began, Galen Weston of Loblaws has seen his personal wealth increase by $1.6 billion. Why does this matter? Because we need to ensure that Canada's recovery lifts everyone up. That means investing in health care, housing and a green economy. Working Canadians should not have to foot the bill for that, while billionaires and big corporations, which saw record profits during the pandemic, get off the hook.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405324">We have already seen that some governments, like the Conservatives in Manitoba, are chomping at the bit to use the pandemic as cover to shut down important services, like the community IV Clinic in Transcona and the Cancer Care site at Concordia Hospital. We can stop those cuts by establishing a wealth tax for millionaires, shutting down tax havens and taxing the extra pandemic profits of big corporations. That is the way we will help working Canadians get their lives back, instead of helping the people at the top protect their fortunes.</ParaText>

There is the emergency response benefit. Nine million Canadians have accessed this benefit. The wage subsidy helps keep the relationship between workers and employers strong. For federally regulated employees, there is unprotected leave because we know it is not only the financial support but it is also ensuring jobs are there. We have made it easier to access by waiving the medical certificates, and we are keeping workers safe with investments in health and safety. We are always going to be there for Canadian workers' families.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6405578">Today's debate touches on an issue that is extremely important to all Canadians. We truly understand the difficulties that the pandemic has caused so many Canadians, which have been made worse by the uncertainty of how long the crisis will last. However, we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We are no longer so far away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405579">Contrary to what some opposition members are saying, we know that our scientists are working very hard to develop a safe and effective vaccine. It is the only way that we will be able to begin overcoming the challenges that the pandemic has caused over the past months.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6405580">This has obviously been a very difficult time for Canadians. It is the challenge of a generation that we are facing, and yes, it is a marathon. It is a marathon that is not over yet. We are still in the second wave of the pandemic and now is not the time to let our guard down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405581">I know we have already given up so much time with our loved ones and our family. Some have lost their job, and others, their health. However, I am here today to reassure Canadians that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We are nearing the end of this marathon. There is a way out of the hard times we are currently in, and it is coming with the distribution of a vaccine. We have just a little further to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405582">Let me be clear: All Canadians will have the opportunity to be vaccinated for free, but we must ensure that there is no political interference in the scientific process that is being undertaken by Health Canada researchers right now. We must ensure that all Canadians have the utmost faith in the vaccine that will ultimately become available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405583">That is why I very much take issue with the approach of opposition members, who are essentially demanding that politicians in this chamber decide on dates for the rollout of a vaccine. Perhaps the opposition is suggesting that we pressure Health Canada to move more quickly than it can in order to conduct its review, but I do not know. What I do know for sure is that for Canadians to have full confidence in the results, we need our independent scientists to do their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405584">I could go on for hours about my deep respect for researchers and scientists. My father is a medical researcher at the University of Montreal. He has spent the last 45 years trying to find a cure for cancer and diabetes. I can tell the House that he would want politicians as far away from researchers as possible in order to allow the results of their work to be as sure as possible so we can be as confident as we can in the results of their research and work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405585">For the remainder of my time, I would like to describe the robust and very clear plan that our government has put in place to date so that Canadians can once again find hope in the coming months. Let me begin by discussing our approach to the acquisition of the vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405586">We knew that the quickest way for Canadians to get access to a vaccine was for Canada to buy internationally from vaccine companies and secure quantities of those vaccines before other countries. That is exactly what we did. Our government has secured the best portfolio of vaccine candidates possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405587">We have been hard at work developing a comprehensive vaccination plan, and we are working with seven different companies to make that happen. Here are the facts. Canada has agreements in place with seven of the world's leading vaccine candidates: Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sanofi, Medicago, Novavax, Oxford and AstraZeneca. Those are the seven we have currently in our contract portfolio. This represents access to approximately 10 doses of the vaccine for each and every Canadian if all of these contract options are exercised. This is more than any other government around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405588">Our Health Canada scientists are currently evaluating four different vaccine candidates. Our Canadian Armed Forces are working right now and stand at the ready to distribute the vaccine as soon as one is approved.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405589">None other than Major-General Dany Fortin, of the Canadian Armed Forces, a Quebecker who has the confidence of the entire country, was appointed to be in charge of the vaccine distribution effort, together with the Public Health Agency of Canada and, of course, provincial and territorial public health authorities. We have already purchased an enormous amount of the supplies we will need. For example, we have purchased 34 freezers, which brings the federal government's capacity to 33.5 million doses of ultra-frozen and frozen vaccines. That is on top of several tens of millions of syringes, needles, compresses and other supplies.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6405590">Now that I have gone through those facts and numbers, I will point out that the co-founder and chairman of Moderna recently stated that Canada is one of the very first countries to pre-order its vaccine, which has shown so much promise. We are guaranteed to receive a portion of the company's initial batch of vaccine doses, pending, of course, approvals by Health Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405591">The goal here is obviously to have as many options at hand as possible so that as soon as vaccines become available and are approved, Canadians will get safe, effective doses that will help us end this pandemic. We know, however, that biomanufacturing capacity has declined in Canada over the last number of years. That is why we have been rebuilding our capacity and our capability to produce new types of vaccines in the future right here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405592">This requires significant investments today. We have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in, for example, the Quebec company Medicago, which has a potential Canadian vaccine candidate, and in the National Research Council's facilities in Montreal. This investment will ensure that we have a much more robust domestic biomanufacturing capacity in the future than exists at the moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405593">When it comes to Canada's COVID-19 vaccine plan, we are ready with a diversified portfolio of vaccine candidates, which are undergoing regulatory review and approval processes as we speak. We have secured access to tens of millions of vaccine doses that, as we said earlier in this chamber and I will repeat again, should be arriving in early 2021. We are working with our partners in the provinces and territories and with our partners in first nations in order to ensure that those vaccines can be delivered to everybody in this country as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405594">The bottom line is that Canadians want a safe and reliable vaccine, and that is what the Government of Canada will secure. For this to work, we need to come together across party lines and all across our country to ensure that all Canadians have the utmost confidence to take the vaccine once it is ready. It is unity, not division, that we need now more than ever, as we enter the next critical phase of this exhausting marathon that is and has been the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405606">Madam Speaker, listening to today's debate on our readiness to roll out COVID-19 vaccinations, the opposition would have us believe Canada is languishing right at the back of the line. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Conservatives have thrown out intentionally inaccurate timelines of vaccines not getting to Canadians by 2030. That is completely misleading to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405607">Allow me to reiterate what this government has done and continues to do every day to ensure that Canada is in fact very well positioned when it comes to receiving the initial batch of approved COVID-19 vaccine doses. Many challenges need to be addressed in talking about the rollout of any COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines will only be offered to Canadians when they are proven safe, when they are proven effective and when they have received Health Canada regulatory approval.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405608">Last week, Dr. Sharma, the chief medical adviser at Health Canada, confirmed for us that if the trial data proved accurate, they would be on track to approve the Pfizer vaccine around the middle of this month. That is the same timeline we are seeing in the United States as well as in Europe. The first deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines are anticipated to start in the first quarter of 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405609">The House heard my colleague quote the chairman of Moderna, saying that far from being at the back of the line, Canada was among the very first countries to pre-order that company's vaccine candidate. Alongside Pfizer, Moderna's vaccine candidate would receive regulatory approval very soon. We have continued to inform Canadians about the work we are doing to ensure a viable vaccine is made available to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405610">The Conservatives are trying to change the narrative to suit their own political agenda, but Canadians can rest assured that their rhetoric is just that and that we are doing what we need to do to protect them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405611"> Since the start of the pandemic, this government has worked to ensure that when a vaccine is ready, Canada will be ready. From day one, this government's strategy has been to secure agreements with the developers of vaccine candidates so Canadians are well positioned as clinical trials advance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405612">We have been operating in a highly complex and intensely competitive global market for vaccine procurement, faced with a myriad of differing vaccine types, dosage requirements as well as manufacturing and finishing needs. Working day and night, this government has been dedicated to procuring the very best vaccine candidates for all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405613">These efforts have paid off. Canada has invested in one of the most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolios in the world. We have arrangements with seven potential vaccine suppliers. We have access to more vaccine doses per person than any other country in the world. That is not the story of a country lagging behind; it is a country looking after its interests of every citizen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405614">Our portfolio contains seven leading vaccine candidates: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and Medicago. Already we are hearing very promising clinical trial results for several of these candidates. Canada has seven leading vaccine candidates in our portfolio, four of which are currently under regulatory review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405615"> Far from standing at the back of some notional global queue, Canada is in line with other countries in receiving the vaccine as early as the first quarter of the new year. To ensure that we are moving quickly, we are working in partnership with the United States and European Union so we can share our data and accelerate the vaccine approval process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405616">This is a team effort. Canada is a leading team member. That team mentality has been in evidence from the very early days of this global pandemic. This government has worked non-stop to procure vital PPE and other medical supplies for our front-line health care workers. More than two billion individual pieces of equipment have been secured, with more than half of that already delivered. Additionally, our government has delivered to the provinces and territories more than three million rapid test kits in the last few weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405617">As we continue to aggressively pursue our vaccine candidates, we know that logistics associated with vaccine distribution can be very complex. Contrary to what the Conservatives have been saying for many months, alongside our efforts to procure vaccines, we have been preparing for the administration and distribution of vaccines.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405618">We are ensuring we have the supplies that will be needed in the manufacturing and packaging steps of vaccine production in Canada. Just one example of this preparedness is that during the summer, we procured three fill/finish vaccine systems from Vanrx in Burnaby, British Columbia. These systems are the last portion of a vaccine production line that allows vials to be filled and finished without human intervention, thus allowing a rapid roll out of vaccines while minimizing waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405619">Allowing rapid roll out does not sound like a country at the back of the line. The Conservatives would have us believe we have not done anything to prepare for vaccine distribution. We know that could not be further from the truth. We are ensuring that when a vaccine is ready, we will have the materials needed to support safe and efficient immunization, such as syringes, needles and alcohol swabs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405620">We have already received enough deliveries of syringes and needles to administer nearly 25 million doses of vaccine and we have tens of millions more en route. We know vaccine distribution will be complex, especially in light of the need to transport and store vaccines at specific temperatures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405621">Canada is prepared. We already have the capacity to store up to 33.5 million ultra-frozen and frozen vaccines at any one time. We are ready to meet additional needs based on the Public Health Agency of Canada's requirement for more capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405622"> We know making vaccines available will be a team Canada effort. That is why we continue to work with provinces and territories to ensure we are prepared to securely and efficiently deploy vaccines to Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405623">We are ready for when the rigorous, efficient and not political but scientific Health Canada approval process is completed. The House and all Canadians can rest assured that we will not cease in our efforts to ensure that when a vaccine is ready, Canada will be ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405624">Nobody in the House underestimates the pain, anguish and grief felt by Canadians, the terrible losses felt by our friends and families across the globe during these past distressing months. It has been many months and we are all living with pandemic fatigue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405625">This government is steadfast in its commitment to the health and safety of Canadians. I know I speak for members of the House when I say our top priority remains keeping Canadians safe and healthy. From procuring vaccines to PPE to testing, the government will continue to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to get Canadians through this crisis. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405629">Madam Speaker, the Liberal government has rightly pointed out that the Conservatives seriously eroded Canada's pharmaceutical capacity. Perhaps most starkly is when the Mulroney Conservative government privatized Connaught Labs, a publicly owned laboratory that helped produce vaccines and low-cost prescriptions for Canadians.

              <ParaText id="6405643">As well, I would like to thank the government for selecting Major-General Dany Fortin to be vice president of logistics and operations at PHAC, and for requesting 27 additional Canadian Armed Forces members for secondment to PHAC. I had the honour of serving with General Fortin, including during my last few months in uniform in Baghdad, Iraq. He is a phenomenal leader and a great communicator, and possesses all the necessary skills and experience to succeed in this important position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405644"> I acknowledge that today in a press conference, interestingly enough on the same day as we debate this motion asking for more details on vaccine distribution, we heard that approximately three million Canadians should be vaccinated by the end of March, and that suitable cold storage for the 14 distribution points nationwide should be in place by December 14, 2020. This is good news and should make it much easier for the Liberal MPs and the government to vote in favour of this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405645">Next, I want to focus on what I believe are some important factors and considerations required in crisis planning and management. From 2014-16, I served as the deputy director of planning for all Canadian Forces operations within the Canadian Joint Operations Command. If I were still in that role, I am sure I would be pretty busy today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405646">What are some of the most important elements in crisis management? Leadership, speed of response, a robust plan, adequate resources, a caring and compassionate response, and an excellent communication plan. If we look at the government's vaccine response to date, I think many Canadians would agree that the government has been lacking in many of these areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405647"> Leadership and speed of response are all about making quick and effective decisions while managing the time that is available. However, the government has been slow to close the borders, slow to procure PPE and slow to order these vaccines. Now, despite the latest announcement, the majority of Canadians still do not know when they can expect vaccines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405648">I acknowledge the government's decision to sign procurement deals with multiple vaccine companies. This was prudent. However, prior to today, it was not clear whether Canada had the necessary storage capacity or means of distribution for these vaccines. I am glad to see that we have some additional clarity today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405649">On November 27, the CDS planning directive for the Canadian Armed Forces in support of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout was released. It is an excellent planning directive, which I think all Canadians expect from the military, but it raises some very concerning questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405650">First, why is there no reference to recent strategic political guidance or direction? Without political guidance and direction, the Canadian Armed Forces are required to make planning assumptions. Some of these assumptions within that directive include, first, that the initial shipment will not be on the ground until the first quarter of 2021, and that it will only be enough for a small percentage of the Canadian population. Next, national-level decisions need to be made by PHAC, and those decisions are expected no later than early December, including the need for PHAC to procure the services of a logistics service provider that will be uniquely experienced with the handling of vaccinations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405651">When are these decisions going to be made? Who is this logistics service provider that PHAC has to tender and get out there, or is PHAC going to sole-source that contract as well?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405652">As well, it is important to note the assumptions are over two pages long. What is fascinating about that to me, as a military planner, is that if there are two pages of assumptions, that means there is not clarity and clear direction coming from our government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405653">The question is, why are we so late in the procurement process? Why are there are so many assumptions and a lack of government direction? When will the Canadian military and Canadians receive answers to these questions? Regardless, I am extremely confident in the ability of the Canadian Armed Forces to react accordingly, and they will rise to the occasion in support of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405654">Let us talk about communications. The importance of clear, consistent and timely communications is vital during a crisis. The reason this motion has been introduced, and is being debated today, is because there has been no clear, open, transparent communication on when, how and who will receive vaccines. This lack of detail is creating angst and stress among Canadians across the country. Small businesses, families, seniors and long-term care homes are just looking for clear, consistent answers to these simple questions of when, how and who.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405655">The government has a record, throughout this pandemic, of being consistent in making lots of program announcements but with vague details on when and how Canadians can apply. If we look at the CEBA loan, for example, multiple announcements were made, but it was weeks and months later before Canadians could actually apply for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405656">Let us look specifically at the pandemic. I will go back to August, when the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> said that the vaccine rollout would be starting in the fall. An August PMO news release stated it would be in November 2020. Then we got into September, with the <Affiliation DbId="253382" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> saying early 2021. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, on October 23, said “sometime in the new year”. This goes on and on until even a couple of days ago, when we had the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> saying before summer and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> saying in the coming months. Today, in the PHAC press release, General Fortin was talking about three million Canadians within the first three months of 2021. Finally, there is some level of detail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405657">This lack of detail and consistency is increasing stress and impacting the mental health of thousands of Canadians. At a time of increased fear, anxiety and uncertainty, the government should be making clarity and transparency the priority. Canadians have endured enough. We need to get this country working again. We need this country healthy again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405658"> The impact that this is having on mental health alone is astounding. A July 2020 policy advice paper by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health cited a recent poll that found that 50% of Canadians reported worsening mental health since the pandemic began, with many feeling worried and anxious. One in 10 Canadians polled said that their mental health had worsened a lot as a result of COVID-19. In the same policy paper, substance use was also shown to be on the rise because of COVID-19. A recent poll found that 25% of Canadians aged 35 to 54, and 21% of those aged 18 to 34, had increased their alcohol consumption since social distancing and self-isolation measures due to COVID-19 began. Further, a recent Centre for Addiction and Mental Health study found that women, people who had lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, those who were worried about their personal finances, people with children at home and young people were more likely than others to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression at this time. This data is extremely concerning. It is important that we see all the health impacts that COVID-19 is having on individuals, children, families, businesses and schools, as well as the impact it is having on the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405659">Our motion is simple. It is asking the government to plan and provide clarity on when, how and to whom vaccines will be rolled out to Canadians. I have highlighted so far in this speech that, in crisis management and during pandemics, it is all about leadership, information and sharing that information, which gives truth to power, and providing clear, open, transparent communications. This government must do better on all these fronts for all Canadians. Canadians deserve these answers, and we deserve them now.</ParaText>

In particular, my neighbour in <Affiliation DbId="252791" Type="2">Hastings—Lennox and Addington</Affiliation> is currently the sponsor of a petition that questions vaccines.

              <ParaText id="6405667">Madam Speaker, one of the rules in military planning is a one-third, two-thirds rule: we take one third of the time to do our level of planning and give two thirds to our subordinate organizations. We have a government that has taken arguably 11 months to give direction to the Canadian military to help with this rollout or its procurement. If it is following the one-third, two-thirds rule, is it going to be another 18 months before this plan gets put into place? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405668">My point is this. It is all about time. In my speech I talked about the importance of a timely response, especially in a crisis.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6405674">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to join the debate today in honour of our opposition day motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405675">The Conservative Party is asking the government to put forward something and accomplish something that it has been avoiding since this pandemic began, and that is to show Canadians a plan. We are asking the Liberal government to table, by December 16, an update on how each type of vaccine will be safely delivered, stored and distributed to Canadians; when each vaccine type will be deployed in Canada; what rate of vaccination we can expect for each month; how different segments of the population will be prioritized for vaccines; and how vaccines will be distributed to indigenous communities, armed forces members and veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405676">There is absolutely no reason why the government should not be able to provide this information to Canadians within two weeks. Frankly, I believe the fact that they are not able to provide this information today is incredibly worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405677">The Liberals know, and all of us in this House know, that Canadians have been waiting with bated breath for a vaccine. They have been reviewing the news and looking for updates on the development of one. They have been speculating on what they might do once they receive a vaccine. The government is well aware, of course, that this is key to defeating the virus, keeping Canadians safe and keeping our economy going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405678">In fact, this past spring, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself said, “Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine”. I believe the Prime Minister said this in April, yet all this time has passed and the government has done very little, if anything, to procure a vaccine, plan for its distribution and ensure that every Canadian who wants one will be able to get one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405679"> The Liberal government has been caught completely unprepared and it is truly showing. Canada has ended up behind the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Mexico, Brazil, India and Indonesia for vaccine procurement. There are over 2.7 billion people in line before Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405680">What is really troubling is that the Liberals not only do not have a plan to procure vaccines, but they also seem to have no plan on what they will do once we finally do receive them. They have no plan for distributing vaccines to Canadians, and they have no plan for prioritizing who will be able to have access to vaccines first. In fact, in response to a vaccine procurement plan, the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> tweeted out a graphic stating this supposed plan. It said, “Every Canadian will have access to an effective and free vaccine once ready.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405681">That really is not a plan. It, frankly, was not that good of a graphic either, if I do say so myself, but those are the non-answers that Canadians are incredibly frustrated with. As people in the United States and the United Kingdom will begin receiving vaccines as early as next week, the Liberal government is talking about having vaccinations available to most Canadians by September. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405682">As I said, our neighbours to the south and many around the world will be getting their lives back. They will be seeing families again. They will potentially be reopening some of their businesses and returning safely to their jobs. They could be having weddings, graduations, and holiday celebrations. However, in Canada, we will be missing many of those moments, and we will be missing time with our families and our loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405683">At this pace, Canadians will still be postponing events well into the summer. They will be having to do head counts at weddings and funerals to ensure there are not too many people present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405684">The emotional toll of this pandemic is also impacting mental health, as those struggling with mental health issues and addictions will continue to be isolated from many of their support systems. Further, remote first nation communities, like many in my riding, will likely have to keep their borders closed to stop the spread. Many Canadians with loved ones living abroad, or even in other provinces, will remain separated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405685">Seniors will be expected to content themselves with virtual get-togethers at a time when they could use support from friends and family more than ever. Parents may worry every time they send their kids to school, and students, who are unable to attend in-person classes and who lack reliable Internet, may fall behind or fall through the cracks. Businesses will continue to lose revenue, lay off employees and may potentially close their doors permanently. More workers will lose their jobs, and more families will struggle.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405686">Students and young people will see their careers put on hold, as they graduate into a job market that is one of the worst in history. Tourism operators across the Kenora riding, northern Ontario and Canada will potentially lose yet another season. Many of the airlines that service remote northern communities will not be able to provide that critical service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405687">Canadians are rightfully concerned. They are rightfully frustrated and disappointed with the Liberal government. Citizens have complied with public health guidelines and regulations, and they have really done their part to combat the virus, but people want their lives back, and they want a plan with some hope from the government on how we can get back to that place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405688">I do not understand how the Liberals can expect us to be content with the knowledge that we may have an opportunity for a vaccination in 10 months' time. Unfortunately, this is not coming as a surprise to me, many members on our side of the House and many Canadians. After all, the Liberals have bungled this pandemic response since day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405689">We know they dropped the ball with rapid testing, where an effective rollout could have avoided some of the pain that Canadians have faced over the last few months. Canadians could have potentially been safely visiting with loved ones. Businesses could have stayed open or reopened, and students could have been feeling safe back at school. The Liberals also dragged their feet on closing the border until it was too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405690">In September, the health <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> claimed that she had been “fully briefed” on the risk of COVID-19 by December of last year, yet her government sat by and did nothing for months. If the Liberals had implemented travel restrictions or recommended mask wearing when the minister and the government first knew about the severity of this pandemic, lives could have been saved. We could have avoided the economic shutdown that has devastated businesses and families across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405691">Instead, we got nothing but mixed signals and lectures from the government. As I have said, the Liberal government was clearly unprepared for COVID-19, and after all this time, it is clear that it has not learned from its mistakes, because we are still to see an all-important plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405692">Canadians should be looking ahead to a recovery right now, but instead we are facing increased restrictions. Many businesses that have invested thousands of dollars in health and safety upgrades to help reduce the risk of transmission and keep everyone safe are not even sure if they will be allowed to operate come the spring time, or if it will be financially possible for them to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405693">The government's approach to this crisis can truly be summed up in a quote from the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> in the House. In the chamber a few weeks ago, I stood up and asked the finance minister when we could expect to see a budget and a plan from the government. Her response was that we needed to have patience, but I believe patience is a very privileged position to hold during this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405694">It is easy for politicians to be patient when our livelihoods have not been impacted, but small business owners watching their lives' work slip between their fingers cannot afford to be patient any longer. Workers who have lost their jobs cannot afford to be patient. Vulnerable Canadians who are afraid to leave their homes cannot afford to be patient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405695">Canadians have been patient for nearly 10 months. It is time for the government to be transparent, be accountable and bring forward a real plan to guide our country through the next phase of this health and economic crisis. Today's motion would give the government an opportunity to do just that, and I encourage all of my colleagues in the House to support this important proposal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405700">Madam Speaker, early on in the pandemic, in phase one, it was obvious that we ran into problems because we were not able to produce personal protective equipment. It was a glaring issue with respect to Canada's lack of capacity. Now we are into the vaccine stage, and it has once again shown up as a major issue that we are not able to produce our own vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405701"> In fact, it was the Conservative government that privatized Connaught Labs, which caused this problem and which has exacerbated this problem. Of course, the Liberals did not fix it in all the years that they have been in government.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6405711">Madam Speaker, we are having an important debate today. I am reflecting on the last little while, after listening to the official opposition stir the pot. Conservatives will often throw out different numbers and dates to try to turn it around and make the government look bad. I guess to a certain degree that is their job as the official opposition. However, having said that, I want to talk about the bigger picture, recognizing just how important this issue is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405712">If I had been asked four or five years ago, when the Liberals became government with the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, what the number one most important issue was, I would have said, hands down, it was all about Canada's middle class and those aspiring to become a part of it. That was job one. The Prime Minister was very clear on that issue. It was about the middle class. We had to work hard to encourage, promote and support Canada's middle class. I was not surprised because even back when the Prime Minister was the leader of the Liberal Party as the second opposition party in the House, he was advocating for Canada's middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405713">We were doing relatively well. I could go through a litany of policies, from tax breaks for the middle class to supporting the middle class through the Canada child benefit, supporting seniors with increases in the GIS and investments in our infrastructure, all in support of Canada's middle class. That is what I would have anticipated that we would continue to do throughout the years. It is not to say that we have forgotten about the Canada's middle class, as we still focus our attention on it, but in the last 10 months or so, we have had to recognize the impact the coronavirus is having on our society, not just here in Canada but around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405714">As a direct result of the pandemic, we made this the central focus of the Government of Canada. We focused on minimizing the negatives of the coronavirus from day one, and we have not done it alone. We have been looking for partners and to collaborate with whomever was prepared to work with the government in order to battle the coronavirus. It has proven to be exceptionally effective. I do not have a problem doing comparisons between Canada and other nations. I wish all nations well in combatting the coronavirus, but whether it is the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the cabinet, the Liberal caucus or any members in the chamber at different points in time, we have seen a lot of good work by working with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405715">The Government of Canada knows that we cannot do it alone. We have worked with provinces, territories, indigenous leaders, non-profit organizations and the private sector from day one in order to minimize the negative impacts of the coronavirus. It has been really encouraging. We have seen some of the results. We saw industries in Canada that did not produce protective gear or the alcohol necessary for hand sanitizers make adjustments in order to produce those things in vast quantities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405716">Because of the actions of the Government of Canada, working with the different provinces, municipalities and all the other stakeholders, we were able to stay under the first wave that came to Canada as it was crossing the world. We held under that line for the longest time. That enabled different levels of government, including the national government, to be better prepared going into the second wave. Throughout this entire period, we have seen phenomenal efforts in certain areas, which have put us in the position we are in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405717">We realize how important the vaccine is. Those who are following or watching this debate can know that when the vaccine is ready we will be ready. Every day, seven days a week, the government is working with a wide spectrum of individuals to make sure that, when we can get our hands on a vaccine that has been approved for the safety of Canadians, it will get distributed. That is of the utmost importance. We recognize that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405718">I reflect back to March and April and recall some of the discussions that were taking place inside the chamber and the genuine concern with respect to how we would stay under the line. I remember it well. There was a great deal of collaboration. We have seen all sorts of input coming into different departments, departments that were able to make some of those critical changes to programs. We can talk about the CERB program, where literally eight-plus million Canadians benefited as they became unemployed or lost wages. We could talk about the business programs, from leveraging money through banks to the rent assistance program, to one of my favourites the wage subsidy program. These are the types of things we were working on at the very beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405719"> Even back then, we knew the importance of the vaccine. We have been working on the vaccine for many months. This should not surprise anyone. After listening to the health experts and looking at the science with respect to what was happening, as a government, we entered into negotiations well before most countries in the world. We are in a far greater and better position as a direct result of a lot of the work that was done back during the early months of the summer, and I would even argue before that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405720">We often hear about the seven vaccines. Tens of millions of vaccines from seven companies were negotiated by this government. We are starting to see some of the rewards of those negotiations, as we finally see some light at the end of the tunnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405721">Members should look at what the Hansard has to say with respect to the whole vaccine debate. It would be interesting to see how many members of the opposition, when they had the opportunity during the summer to ask thousands of questions, actually asked questions, such as what we were doing with respect to vaccine contracts. That is the nice thing about the Hansard.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405722">I suspect Canadians might be a little disappointed in the collective opposition. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. As we get closer and start hearing about the vaccine, now the Conservatives are saying they want the vaccine and want us to give them the date. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405723">How can a date be provided when it has not been approved? Are they trying to say we should set a date and then mandate Health Canada to say that is going to be the date? Do they say politics are more important than the health and well-being of Canadians? It sure sounds like that is what opposition members are saying, because they are saying they want dates. That is what they are arguing for.</ParaText>

They have been pushing a great deal for a date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405730">Hindsight is a wonderful thing to have. One my colleagues made reference to hindsight in a story. The government has been consistent from day one. We were not going to make political decisions, but would rely on experts and on the science. Those are the individuals who are going to put our country in a good position going forward, as they have in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405731">Opposition members say that we were late on recommending masks and ask why we did not recommend masks earlier. The simple answer to that is that we were following the advice provided by health experts. When the health experts said that we should have people wear masks for x, y and z reasons, that is exactly what we said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405732"> At the very beginning masks were not emphasized. Today, they are emphasized. It is not because of politics. It is because of what health experts were saying at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405733">Going back to hindsight, now that we say masks are important, the Conservatives are saying, “Those darn Liberals, they did not say we should have been wearing masks, and we should have been.” At the end of the day, we are listening to the science. It is not just Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405734">There is a community around the world that supports fighting the coronavirus, and Canada plays a very important role in that, whether it is the World Health Organization or Health Canada. They provided the necessary information. The departments of health and procurement continue to work together, as does the defence department, the Prime Minister's Office and other departments. All are concerned and all are playing an important role in combatting the coronavirus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405735">Members have talked about the impact of the coronavirus. We all know the impacts. The previous speaker was talking about the impact on weddings and funerals. I just lost a very close personal friend, Lito Taruc, host on CKJS, who was well loved in the Filipino community and outside that community in Winnipeg. I suspect hundreds, if not thousands, would have showed up to pay their final respects to the family. It was a very difficult time. Lito was only a few years older than myself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405736">We all understand the impacts. Back in June, we did not have graduation ceremonies. I am used to going to Sisler High School and Maples Collegiate and participating either directly or indirectly, as well as with the Children of the Earth High School, St. John's High School and R. B. Russell Vocational High School.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405737">We had hundreds of graduates, back in June, who did not get the same sort of treatment that they would have received, in terms of those ceremonies, without the coronavirus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405738">We all know about the weddings that have been put off, cancelled or in some cases that went ahead with much smaller numbers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405739">It is not just the economy and the money, there is a strong social component to this. All of us, I believe, understand that. We are all anxious to see the defeat of the coronavirus, and the vaccine plays a critical role in that. The government benches understand the importance of getting it out there as quickly as we can, and that is one of the reasons we did not limit our options to one or two suppliers. We secured seven suppliers, with tens of millions of doses, more than enough, cumulatively, to cover our entire population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405740">We do not know for fact, but we have a good idea today and we will have a better idea tomorrow, which ones are going to get approved and how soon they will actually be able to come to Canada. All that will happen. What is important is that, when it starts to happen, we have something in place that is going to ensure its distribution. We have announced relatively recently, but everyone knows, that members of the Canadian Forces have been participating in fighting the coronavirus for many months. No one is surprised that we would once again turn to our forces to ensure that we have a distribution that is going to be effective for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405741">I listen to many of the discussions today, and I do not know to what degree members seem to want to be focused on being critical of Ottawa and the federal government. That is fine. That is fair. They are in opposition, but they also need to realize that it is more than the federal government that ultimately sees the injection into the arm of our constituents. We need provinces, territories and indigenous leaders to also be at the table and a part of the discussions. They are, and they have been there for months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405742">The opposition parties say they want to know who is going to get it and when, and which ones are going to be the priorities. Those are very good questions, and provinces have that responsibility. Ottawa continues to work with provinces to ensure that there is some dialogue on the issue. We all have our personal opinions in terms of who should receive it first, but Ottawa will continue to work with provinces and recognize the provinces. There is reason to be optimistic. Members should take a look at the flu vaccine; 16 million doses, during the pandemic, were administered through provinces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405757">I will, however, give him two facts on this good working relationship he claims the government has with Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405758">First of all, Quebec has been waiting for two months now for a meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about increasing health transfers. Oddly enough, the meeting that was meant to be on December 5 has been pushed to December 10. Maybe the Prime Minister had a scheduling conflict. However, if the meeting is held on December 10, we will not be able to question the Prime Minister on it before the end of January. It is not a very good example of working together to make the Government of Quebec wait for two months during an unprecedented pandemic. There was a breakdown of that working relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405759">Second of all, the government has not kept up with increases to the health transfers. This is an encroachment on the provinces' and Quebec's jurisdictions. Furthermore, Quebec's health minister sent the federal government a letter to get information about the plan, but he has heard nothing but radio silence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405760">Does my colleague consider this to be an example of the federal government working together with the provinces and Quebec?</ParaText>

I can tell the member that when it comes to the health care transfers, this government has been far more sensitive than the previous government, where there were no first ministers meetings on the issue of health care. Under this administration, there has been dialogue. That dialogue will continue, but our focus today is primarily the coronavirus. There are ongoing discussions through departments of health and first ministers at different levels.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405771">Madam Speaker, the member raised a good point. One of the things we have seen with the pandemic are the areas we can improve upon with respect to our industries. We have seen that with PPE or hand sanitizers, as I cited. Canada used to do quite well with respect to the local production of vaccines. Over the last number of months, the government has been looking at a wide variety of options on how we could increase the potential for vaccinations being produced in Canada. That will be an ongoing discussion in the months ahead.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405773">I am participating in this debate tonight from my hometown of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan. Right next door to me is the Flying Dust First Nation, one of nine members of the Meadow Lake Tribal Council. On the east side of my riding is the Prince Albert Grand Council, which is comprised of 12 first nations. There are also many Métis communities across my northern Saskatchewan riding along with a huge agricultural sector and tourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405774"> The reason I highlight this is that all our communities, including the first nation and Métis communities in northern Saskatchewan, are looking to the government for a clear and competent vaccine plan, but they are not finding one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405775">The text of today's motion indicates that “a vaccine is essential to the health, safety, and economic security of every Canadian.” My constituents are now observing countries around the world as they detail their vaccine plans, with real tangible timelines, and are asking where Canada's plan is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405776">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> naively announced on election night in 2015 “Canada is back.” Now we understand just how true those words were. Canada is indeed at the back of the line, behind one-third of the world population, in getting vaccines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405777">The attack from the Liberals on this is easily predicted, that we as Conservatives are playing politics. It may come as a shock to the Liberals, but as Canada's official opposition, it is indeed our job to push back, to hold government accountable and, in some cases, even oppose and criticize it. Without the great work of my colleagues in the Conservative Party, Canada and Canadians would be much worse off than they are today in the face of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405778"> What do I mean by that? In my role as shadow minister for indigenous services, at many times throughout this pandemic I have identified gaps and serious issues facing indigenous people. This began with many indigenous businesses not being able to access the government's wage subsidy program because of the way it was structured. After weeks of fighting, finally the government modified its program and allowed these businesses to access the wage subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405779">Next was the issue of elections on first nations. As Canada was dealing with the first wave of this pandemic, elections were scheduled to occur, while many first nations were developing public health measures to ensure their people were kept safe. As members can imagine, contrary to what the Liberals clearly want, the height of a pandemic is no time to hold an election. Therefore, I, with the help of many, pushed the minister and his department to find a solution. They did. They found the ability to delay these elections in regulations created under the Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405780">A few months into the pandemic, I was made aware of a major gap in the government's CEBA loan program, thanks to the excellent advocacy of Tabatha Bull of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, Shannin Metatawabin of the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association and many others. Indigenous businesses do not often use traditional banking systems. Instead, they make use of the many aboriginal financial institutions, AFIs, across Canada. Alongside many stakeholders, we advocated for the government to create the emergency loan program administered through NACCA. It was eventually announced at the end of April, but still businesses could not access it until over two months later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405781">Let us not forget that it was the Conservative Party that first raised the idea of closing our borders to international travellers. Our concerns were met with scoffs and suggestions of racism from the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>. Then what happened? The government eventually listened and closed our borders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405782">In addition to that, it was our party that fought the government to investigate rapid tests after countries around the world started to introduce them for use. The Liberals at the time, which I predict they will again do today, accused us of being too partisan. What happened? Within weeks of us raising it, the government started looking into and approving rapid tests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405783">It is clear that if it were not for our strong, principled opposition, Canadians would be far worse off than they are today in the face of the second wave of this pandemic. Here we are today once again identifying a major gap in the government's handling of the pandemic, hoping to receive all-party support and finally receive some semblance of a plan from the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405784">Getting back to the motion, the Conservatives, and I believe all Canadians, want to know how each type of vaccine will be safely delivered to Canada, stored and distributed to Canadians; the data on which each vaccine type will be first deployed in Canada and the rate of vaccinations anticipated by month; any intended federal guidance with respect to the deployment of the vaccine by priority group, such as front-line health workers and seniors; and, finally, the plan for distribution of the vaccine to indigenous communities, members of the Canadian Armed Forces and veterans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405785">For the remainder of my time, I want to focus on the importance of a plan for rural and remote indigenous communities, urban indigenous people and indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405786"> During the first wave of the pandemic, indigenous people experienced far lower positive and mortality rates for COVID-19 because of strong local leadership. While the Liberals were playing politics about closing borders, many first nations did exactly that and were able to control who came into their communities in order to keep their people safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405787">It is no secret that there are many unsafe living conditions in many of these indigenous communities across our country. In the face of such adversity, indigenous people weathered the first wave better than any other demographic across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405788"> As Canada has experienced the second wave, indigenous communities are now dealing with increased COVID fatigue, leading to people to let their guard down and sometimes make poor decisions, thus increasing the risk to their families and communities. With no plan from the government on when these communities may receive a vaccine, how it will be transported to them and how many doses they will be provided, the leadership in these communities cannot provide hope that this will soon be over. This is precisely why we need a plan from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405789">Eight months ago, I raised the issue of collecting accurate and comprehensive data on urban indigenous people with the <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>. The purpose of this would be to reduce jurisdictional wrangling. Unfortunately, as we saw last week, instead of action, the minister decided to point the finger at the provinces and municipalities. Without accurate and comprehensive data on urban indigenous people, how can the government plan to vaccine this vulnerable population and learn from this pandemic?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405790">My office has been in close contact with the Aboriginal Friendship Centres of Saskatchewan as well as its national organization. These groups have been providing much of the care for urban indigenous populations throughout the pandemic and they also have been advocating for better data so they can continue to provide these high-quality services. Without a plan that includes answers on the how, when and who, these organizations are left to fill the gap on which the government should be providing leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405791">An issue that has become near and dear to me, as I have served in the capacity as shadow minister over the past year, is indigenous businesses. I strongly believe that without true economic reconciliation, Canada's relationship with indigenous people will continue to be one of dependence. We need to put our effort and focus on supporting indigenous entrepreneurs who remain so connected to their nations and allow them to reinvest in their communities to provide real and lasting positive outcomes. That means the Liberals making good on their promise of a 5% procurement target for indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405792">The government cannot continue to operate in silos. This need to be a whole-of-government approach across all departments. Out of all the contracts awarded to businesses across Canada to produce PPE, the fact that indigenous businesses made up less than 1% is unacceptable, especially when hundreds of indigenous businesses lined up to be providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405793">Indigenous businesses, like all businesses, need a level of certainty in order to successfully operate and make continued investments. As I pointed out, the government has done a poor job in supporting indigenous businesses throughout this pandemic and now, as these businesses are again looking for a plan, they are seeing a government with no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405794">In speaking with indigenous business stakeholders this week, we heard concerns regarding the lack of a mention of indigenous entrepreneurs in the fall economic statement. This has led them to be very disappointed and concerned with their ability to even survive a second wave, instead of focusing on the critical role they could be playing in the economic post-pandemic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405795">That is why it is so important today that we pass this motion to provide these businesses and all Canadians some semblance of certainty during this difficult time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405796">Madam Speaker, in light of what is happening with the pandemic, we know that we are going to be short on the vaccine in the beginning. So far, what we have learned from the government is that approximately about three million vaccines will be made available to Canadians. Of course, in meeting the basic needs, whether it be seniors in long-term care facilities or health care providers, that is not going to be sufficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405797">In addition to that, I am gravely worried about those who have other pre-existing conditions, such as the people in the Downtown Eastside in my riding, the people who are underhoused and homeless at the moment. Many of them are very challenged. In fact, the Downtown Eastside now has the highest rate of COVID infection in the entire city.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405798">To that end, I wonder whether the member will support a call for action for the federal government to ensure that front-line workers and those who are most vulnerable, including those with pre-existing conditions, have access in priority to the vaccine.</ParaText>

We have been advocating for the data to ensure that these vulnerable people do not fall through the cracks. I 100% agree that applies to the distribution of vaccines as well.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada held a press conference on his front steps every day. We hung on his every word. MPs and all Canadians were wondering what was going on. We were waiting for news. We wanted to know what was happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405815">Information is important in a pandemic. People fear uncertainty. They want to trust their elected officials and their leaders to make decisions. They want to know that someone, somewhere, is in control. They want to know that someone, somewhere, is taking the reins.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405816">Let's not forget that schools and day cares closed. Parents did not know what to do with their children and ended up forced to stop working to take care of their children at home. It is not that the parents do not like that, but when they cannot earn money to take care of their children, that is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405817">Let's not forget the travel restrictions, everyone who had booked trips, the harm done to travel agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405818">We all remember the images of the toilet paper shortages and people who were running around to get toilet paper because someone somewhere said that there might be a shortage. That caused a rush on toilet paper. It was worth more than gold at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405819">Seniors were confined to their homes. Students were learning remotely. Proms were cancelled. That may not seem like much, but a prom comes around once in a young person's life. Their entire high school education leads up to the prom, which was cancelled, postponed until fall, then cancelled again. Finally, there were none. Students are waiting for their diploma, but at least they will get one. No one really knows how. Nonetheless, there will be no event to mark the end of their high school education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405820">We learned to keep our distance, wear a mask, and wait and wait and wait. Nine months in, where are we at?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405821">Today, the Premier of Quebec announced that family gatherings will not be allowed in Quebec this Christmas. Restaurants, movie theatres and gyms are closed. There are no more group activities. Health measures were more relaxed for several months, but now they are getting stricter because, unfortunately, the COVID-19 case count is rising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405822">I would like to take two minutes to applaud the resilience of business owners. Restaurant, bar and movie theatre owners, and business owners in general, have had to go through this whole crisis without really knowing what would happen next.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405823">One day, they are allowed to open. They invest, they do more to protect themselves, and then they are forced to close again. They do not know what is going to happen. Fortunately, MPs did the right thing and voted for measures to help them. That does not change the fact that these people do not want to be helped. What they want is to serve people. They want to do what they are good at. That is what they want, and that is what keeps them alive. Unfortunately, it is not working. I want to salute the people who work for these businesses and sometimes have to deal with people who are not all that patient. These employees have to enforce mask-wearing, and that is not always easy, but that is the situation we are in right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405824">Quebec's numbers are frightening, with 150,000 confirmed cases and nearly 7,500 deaths. There are red zones everywhere, and people are experiencing mental health problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405825">In a recent poll by the Ordre des psychologues du Québec, 86% of psychologists said they have seen a rise in psychological distress and an exacerbation of their clients' symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are more pronounced in psychologists' clients, and domestic violence is on the rise. With statistics like these, we would have expected the Liberal government to take the lead from day one and make Canadians' health this government's top priority. Unfortunately, that was not so, and the government was slow to react.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405826">The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> allowed the pandemic early warning system to be shut down a few months before the outbreak. The government sent hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and gowns from government stockpiles to China. Within a month, we had a shortage here. The government refused to close our borders, allowed the virus to spread across the country and dithered about whether or not masks should be worn in Canada. At the very outset, the Minister of Health declared several times that the risk was low. Tell that to the regions in the red zone today, where everything is closed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405827">The government was slow to implement federal assistance programs and, above all, to fix them when the opposition parties called for major changes that would help everyone. We are on the ground, and we know what is happening in our ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405828">Now our allies are going to get the vaccine before we do. That is the reality. From the outset, the Liberals put their trust in a partnership with China. While other countries were getting organized, we were waiting for our vaccines. We found ourselves no further ahead. Canada was left out to dry because the agreement with China failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405829">This was to be expected, since the writing was on the wall. However, the government put all of our eggs in one basket. While other countries were signing multiple agreements and securing their place at the front of the line for vaccines, we had to go to the back of the line and wait. Sure, we managed to buy millions of vaccines. The government is constantly talking about a portfolio of available vaccines and saying that there are 50 or 100 vaccines per Canadian. I do not know what today's number is. The first and second vaccines are the most important ones, not the 10th or 25th. When will we get the vaccines?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405830">The motion we moved today is simple. It calls on the government to give us and Canadians some information. Since a vaccine is the only way to put an end to red zones and social distancing, the only way to give Canadians their lives back, it makes sense that they would want answers from the government about the vaccination plan. It would also make sense for the government to give us an approximate date and answer our questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405831">If the government does not answer our questions, the only thing it could mean is that it is trying to hide something. It means that it is hiding something from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405832">I invite everyone to read the motion. There is nothing partisan about it. We are just asking the government to answer the questions “when”, “where” and “who”, so that Canadians are better informed. This is not about creating false hope. It is simply about giving us the facts so that we know what to expect and can make arrangements accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405833">If the Liberals vote against this motion, it is surely because they have things to hide from Canadians. We are just asking them to do the right thing, give Canadians the facts and vote in favour of the motion we moved today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405845">Canada and Quebec were once scientific research hotspots. Sadly, that is no longer the case, and that is one reason we find ourselves in the unfortunate position of having to wait for a vaccine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405851">Before I begin, I would like to talk about what appears to be the government's attempt at communication. Every time that we ask the government a question, we are told that we are looking to pick a fight. The <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> used that logic again today, during question period, saying that we were trying to pick a fight instead of working together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405852">All I want to say is that the motion our Conservative colleagues moved today is about working together, because it is seeking more information on vaccines, and this information is vital to keeping everyone safe. I say this simply as a little warning. I am not trying to pick a fight with my speech. I am looking to point out the blind spots that the government unfortunately missed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405853">In that respect, I could begin by saying that I heard the <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the government leader</Affiliation> say to the leader of my party when he gave his speech that we have never asked questions about vaccine development. That surprised me because one example of the government's inaction is the case of Medicago. I remember making many representations in that regard because Medicago received a letter of intent from the Liberal government in March, but we had to make many representations before the government finally sent Medicago the confirmation of its financial support in July. It took four months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405854">Today, Medicago, the only company conducting pharmaceutical research in Quebec, is four months behind. That is symptomatic of what we are seeing today. It is a form of inaction on the part of the government with regard to the vaccine and the consistency needed to support the vaccination process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405855">Earlier, my Conservative colleague talked about something that I also wanted to bring up. He talked about a lack of information. If there is one thing that is key to making people feel safe in a pandemic, it is information.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405862">Madam Speaker, as I was saying, there are two dimensions to this crisis. The first is to keep our workers safe, and, with our collaboration, the government managed to do that by introducing the CERB and the wage subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405863">The other dimension concerns health infrastructure, including the search for a vaccine. During the first wave, we received many calls from our constituents who wanted information on the CERB and the wage subsidy. Unfortunately, when it comes to vaccination, we have a big problem, because we cannot properly inform our constituents, who have very legitimate concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405864">Another rather crucial element is the fact that, without clear guidance on vaccination, I do not think it is possible to foresee a return to normal. Earlier this week, the government presented an economic statement without any recovery plan. I hope that will come soon, but we cannot think about economic recovery without a vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405865">If Canada goes last, which appears to be the case, our economic recovery will be delayed and getting life back to normal for the entire population will happen more slowly. We therefore need clear guidance as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405866">Thinking back on the government's actions on health and what it has been saying these past few days, I thought of a rather simple principle that is used in the health sector, the precautionary principle. It means rapidly taking concerted action when confronted with danger or elevated risk. It emphasizes being proactive, not reactive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405867">It seems to me that the government did not apply the precautionary principle when it comes to the vaccine. We are faced with two major questions that remain unanswered by the government: when will the vaccine be available to all Quebeckers, and how will it be administered?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405868">The question of when is still a grey area. I will come back to that. The question of how is also a grey area, since we do not know how the vaccine will be distributed to the provinces. Has the government decided to distribute the vaccine based on the number of cases or based on the available infrastructure? We have no idea. This planning is the federal government's responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405869">That is what is shocking. The government is interfering in areas of jurisdiction where it does not belong. One example is how, in its economic statement, the government is proposing $1 billion to support long-term care homes by imposing Canada-wide standards. This is an area of provincial jurisdiction, not federal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405870">The government is intervening and maybe applying that precautionary principle in these areas of jurisdiction that do not belong to it, but it is not doing anything to sort out when and how to procure the vaccine. This is cause for concern and confusion for many Quebeckers, and many Canadians too, I am sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405871">With respect to the question of when, earlier this week, I heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say that a majority of Canadians would be vaccinated by September. For a sovereignist, a majority means 50 plus one, or 51%. What kind of majority is the government talking about? Is it 51%, 60% or 70% of the population? That is another pretty big grey area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405872">The government also said that potentially by March 31 next year, 700,000 Quebeckers would be vaccinated, which is 8% of the population. Once again, we do not know how Quebec will get these vaccines from the government. The federal government itself does not seem to know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405873">Three large companies are the furthest along in their vaccine research: Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. However, the federal government does not seem to know where it stands in the order of precedence. The Prime Minister told us that we rank high with Moderna, but we do not know where we stand with Pfizer or AstraZeneca. We are completely in the dark about when and how the government will procure the vaccine.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405874">I would like to highlight something else I found quite shocking. On Tuesday of this week, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced that $126 million would be invested to increase Canada's domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity through the National Research Council of Canada. I quote: “Once a vaccine is proven to work, we’ll also need to be able to produce and distribute it here at home.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405875"> The Prime Minister said this on Tuesday, but that is not when he should have said it. The government should have said it in April. This brings us back to the precautionary principle I mentioned. We already knew in April that pharmaceutical companies were well on their way to finding a vaccine. It was then that the government should have invested in the infrastructure needed to produce it ourselves. What made the government act only on Tuesday instead of in April? That is a rather important question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405876">We also know that the COVID-19 vaccines are made using a new technology. We knew that in April. We knew that our facilities in Quebec and in Toronto, the two major facilities capable of producing vaccines in Canada, did not have the required infrastructure. The government took no action before Tuesday, when it made this $126-million announcement. That means that we lost eight whole months when vaccines could have been made here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405895">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Jonquière for a very good speech. I would like to talk a bit more about those pharmaceutical companies, and I'm drawing inspiration from the open letters my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252694" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> published. He published another one just this week in L'aut'journal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405896">Recently, the Government of Canada admitted that the U.S., the U.K. and Germany would start vaccinating their populations in December 2020, whereas Canada would have to wait until the first months of 2021. Why will Canada be starting the process months after the others? It is hard to know, because the Government of Canada signed confidential agreements with pharmaceutical companies that put Quebeckers and Canadians in line behind the Americans, Brits and Germans. That is why the Bloc Québécois demanded that the federal government agree to the Government of Quebec's request for more information about how we will be getting the vaccine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405897">The Government of Quebec and the Bloc Québécois want to understand why Canada did not get any guarantees for priority processing of its orders. Why did it not align its approval process with those of the vaccine-producing countries in order to synchronize timelines? Why will Quebeckers not be vaccinated at the same time as the rest of the world? Why is Canada unable to come up with a solution to Canada's vaccine production and licensing capacity so that the vaccine could be produced in Canada on a tight deadline? Above all, why did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> give a false impression about how quickly the vaccine would be available in Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405898">Upon closer examination of the Government of Canada's decisions and actions, it is hard to know whether there is a real plan for vaccination and, more importantly, whether there is any willingness to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity in Canada, particularly in Quebec, with Medicago, a Quebec-based pharmaceutical company that has the capacity to meet the demand for vaccination with other international pharmaceutical labs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405899">That is why the Bloc Québécois demanded that the federal government agree to the Government of Quebec's request for more information about the decisions and actions of the Government of Canada. With former Bill <Document DbId="10710867" Type="3">C-13</Document>, the federal government had established the legal framework required to ensure that pharmaceutical companies could produce a competitor's vaccine without having to wait for a licence. However, Ottawa backed out after the first step. Lastly, the Prime Minister gave false impressions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405900">I will now speak about the destruction of our pharmaceutical industry because it is worthwhile delving into this issue. I would like to remind my colleagues in the House of Commons that just a few years ago, Quebec had the capacity to develop and sell vaccines. For decades, Quebec was a world leader in the pharmaceutical sector. In Longueuil, Laval and Montreal, in the metropolitan area, large pharmaceutical companies were well established in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405901">Under the Government of Quebec's requirements, Canada was collaborating with the Government of Quebec to develop a true pharmaceutical cluster. At the time, the pharmaceutical industry in Quebec was thriving, with many start-ups. The governments of Canada and Quebec were providing economic incentives and policies favouring the development of large laboratories, as well as local manufacturing of innovative drugs. Hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of start-ups, SMEs and jobs were being created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405902">In the 1980s and 1990s, through the collaboration between the federal and Quebec governments, Quebec built a true pharmaceutical cluster, but as usual, the federal government simply destroyed Quebec's pharmaceutical cluster in the 1990s and the 2000s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405903">It was the Liberal Party that started the destruction in the 1990s by reducing patent protections for pharmaceutical companies operating in Canada. The Liberal Party then suspended Technology Partnerships Canada, a risk-sharing investment program. When the Conservatives returned to power in the 2000s, Stephen Harper simply finished what the Liberals had started by abolishing the program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405904">From then until 2012, all of the big pharmaceutical laboratories in Quebec shut down one after the other. Once again, Quebec was abandoned by Ottawa. Meanwhile, the Liberals and the Conservatives chose to favour pharmaceutical companies in Ontario at the expense of those in Quebec. I should also point out that the pharmaceutical companies in Ontario have always contributed significant amounts to Liberal and Conservative election campaigns. Both the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party were responsible for Ottawa's choice to stop investing in pharmaceutical companies in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6405905">That is why, even though the Government of Quebec wanted to develop its pharmaceutical cluster on its own, it simply could not keep this industry competitive in the face of global competition. What kind of dynamic growth would we have seen in Quebec's pharmaceutical industry? What kind of expertise would Quebec have now? I believe that this industry would still have been one of the best in the world. It would surely be in the process of manufacturing a vaccine. That vaccine might even have been approved by now, and we would have been vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405906">Once again, Ottawa undermined an important industry in Quebec. Once again, Quebec had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, but Ottawa kept dragging Quebec down. Once again, Quebec's expertise was world-renowned, but Ottawa kept plundering Quebec's industry to help Ontario's. It is always the same old story with Ottawa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405907">As we saw with the shipbuilding, auto and forestry industries, and as we are currently seeing with the aerospace industry, Ottawa continues to drag Quebec down. Quebec gives half of its tax revenue to Ottawa, but Quebeckers have a bad feeling that they are paying for the destruction of Quebec's most successful businesses with their own money. They have felt that way for far too long. We see it happening with the decisions made by the Liberal and Conservative parties, which do not really care about Quebec's economic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405908">I think it is worth mentioning these industries. It has been said that this was a missed opportunity and that there has been a decline in the pharmaceutical industry in Quebec. We were once one of the major world centres. In the early 2000s, we had seven big private pharmaceutical labs in Canada, six of which were located in Quebec. They were Merck Frosst, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Witten A.R., Shire BioChem, Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca, whose vaccine is currently undergoing approval.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405909">In 2006, the best year for Quebec's pharmaceutical sector, investments totalled $600 million. Six big pharmaceutical companies had research centres that employed 8,100 people. The pharmaceutical sector had 21,000 employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405910">All the big pharmaceutical laboratories subsequently closed their doors. Now, the pharmaceutical industry is one-third smaller. Several major researchers have left the country. Several small pharmaceutical companies were bought out for their patents, and their products are now manufactured abroad. That is the crux of the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405911">If this had not happened a dozen or so years ago, the vaccine could surely have been manufactured in Quebec and Canada. The pandemic might have been over by now, and we would have been able to leave our homes. We could have spent Christmas with our families. The Liberals and the Conservatives bear a certain responsibility for this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405917">I am also worried because Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, asked that we start by vaccinating seniors, health care workers, essential workers and members of the most vulnerable communities, such as indigenous people. As we know, several families often share one dwelling in indigenous communities, which is very dangerous for spreading a virus. I am very worried when the government says that just six million doses will be available in a few months, because I think that means that we will still be dealing with this pandemic for a long time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405934">Madam Speaker, it has been a bit of a custom of mine over the last couple of weeks, during Adjournment Proceedings, to bring good news to the House, and tonight is no exception. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405935">My sister and her husband, just last week, welcomed their first-born. Beatrice MacDonald was born to my sister Allie and her husband Kyle MacDonald. I am so excited to welcome Beatrice here in Canada's House, and I want to congratulate Allie and Kyle and thank all the health care professionals: the staff, nurses and doctors at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital who allowed Beatrice to arrive safely and took good care of my sister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405936">We know what a challenging year this has been for our health care professionals, and they did not let it show. With professionalism and great care, they took care of my family and my newest little niece. It is really important that I have the opportunity to mention that to the House this evening.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Michael Barrett:</B> Now I do want to talk about time, and I thank my colleague for mentioning that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405939">For over 40 hours, we had Liberal members filibuster committees to prevent the truth. Opposition members wanted to continue the work that parliamentarians had agreed to undertake during the beginning of this Parliament's first session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405940">What happened? The WE Charity scandal gripped Parliament. It gripped this country, and on the eve documents were to be released, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament, shutting it down for six weeks and saying there would be all kinds of time to answer those questions when Parliament resumed. The Liberals just needed time for a reset to give their new vision for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405941">The second verse was the same as the first. We heard promises that dated back to 1993 that they have not been able to keep. I would have been about nine years old the first time they tried some of those commitments. Maybe on the 15th attempt they will get it right, but we are not optimistic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405942">Canadians will see, south of the border, our American neighbours start getting vaccinated next week. The same will occur in the European Union, in the United Kingdom and in many, many other countries. Canadians wonder when we are going to get a vaccine. They wonder what the plan is. They wonder what is going to happen next year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405943">The government continues to introduce legislation hastily and then seek the unanimous consent of the House. I am proud to say Her Majesty's loyal opposition has supported important measures to help Canadians during these times, but it is really no thanks to planning on the part of the government. It wasted those six weeks during its prorogation cover-up. It wasted 40 hours at the ethics committee, dozens of hours at the finance committee and many hours at other committees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405944">What are the Liberals so desperate to hide that they are not willing to get to work, roll up their sleeves and introduce a plan for Canadians?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405946">We have had dialogues in the past and this evening we are talking about a few issues. The member makes reference to filibusters, he talked about the prorogation, he talked about the government bringing in legislation and wanting to rush it through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405947">We have been talking a lot about the MAID issue, which is very important. It is a life-and-death matter. The member nodded his head in the affirmative, recognizing just how important that legislation is. However, we have a Superior Court in Quebec with a deadline that is coming up, and we see the Conservatives conducting a filibuster on this important legislation. Now, they will say that they want to have more time, but we have been debating the issue of assisted death for many years now. There have literally been hundreds of hours of debate, committee hearings and so forth. With this pending deadline, we are now hoping to get the bill into third reading as early as tomorrow, yet the Conservatives are filibustering. I guess they would argue that is a good filibuster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405948">The member talked about the prorogation. I do not know how he calculates more than three days, because, in theory, we were supposed to come back on September 21 and we ended up coming back on September 23. Keep in mind, we sat for four days inside this House where we literally had hundreds if not thousands of questions to the government during the summer. I think that there has been a net gain for the official opposition and other opposition parties in terms of being able to ask questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405949"> There is always the opportunity for opposition to work with the government. I like the word “collaboratively”. At one time, I think there was a higher sense of collaboration, and the member is right in the sense that, on the coronavirus, which I spoke earlier today about and I know how important that issue is to Canadians, we are constantly looking for collaboration. We have been receiving collaboration from all over Canada, from other levels of government, such as municipalities and provincial and territorial governments, indigenous leaders, and non-profits. There are so many sectors working with the government, and even the Conservatives, to a certain degree, have. However, when it comes to the vaccination issue, I think we may see the Conservative wanting in terms of being a little more creative in providing better solutions or ideas on distribution, keeping in mind the federal responsibilities working with provinces and so forth. We will get there, because we are listening to the health care experts and science on this issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405955">Madam Speaker, since I came here in 2015, the government has waged a full-fledged attack on my home province of Alberta. It began with flippant statements by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> even before he was elected as the Prime Minister. I remember when he forgot to mention Alberta on Canada Day. There is the carbon tax, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>. These are all attacks on Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405956">We are now seeing the new clean fuel standard, which is once again a full-fledged, frontal attack by the Liberals on what the energy sector is all about. I have some statistics: 30,000 jobs nationally and approximately 20 billion dollars' worth of capital will leave Canada if we put in the clean fuel standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405957">Yesterday at committee, I had the opportunity to ask the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> about the CFS. He told me not to worry, as the government is diversifying the economy, and that Alberta should be thankful for the new standard being put in place. Nothing could be further from the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405958">About a month ago, Alberta released a brand new recycling hub idea to recycle plastics in the province. Not even 24 hours later, the government labelled plastic a toxic substance. What will that do to the energy sector and Alberta as a whole? It attacks the workers and the jobs in that sector. At the end of the day, vehicles are largely made of plastic, as are the pipes that go into the ground. This is yet another unfortunate piling on by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405959">We have seen the government add red tape and cause constant delays in approval processes. When I got here in 2015, I could not have imagined the extent to which the current government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the ministers have gone on to attack my province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405960">Thankfully, we were able to change the provincial government. Unfortunately, we had a Notley NDP government there for a full four years, which added more burden to the energy sector. We still have yet to get rid of the federal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405962">Madam Speaker, I want to first congratulate the Alberta government and all Albertans for their support of Canada's goal to reach zero plastic waste by 2030. Alberta is a key partner in implementing the Canada-wide strategy on zero plastic waste and we welcome the province's recently announced goal to become the western North America centre of excellence for plastics recycling by 2030. We can only reach these goals by working together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405963"> Congratulations are also in order for Alberta's agricultural plastic recycling pilot program, which aims to help address the issue of agricultural plastic waste. Across Canada and across economic sectors, there is an emerging consensus that a circular economic approach is core to addressing the problem of plastic waste and pollution. When plastic waste is reused in new products through enhanced recycling techniques and technologies, there is a significant opportunity to recapture the value of materials, including products such as agricultural plastics used in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405964">We are also encouraged by the unanimous support of a recent motion in the Alberta legislature to examine the opportunities afforded by implementing extended producer responsibility. With it, Alberta has the opportunity to move into the ranks of the leading provinces in plastic recycling, such as Ontario, Quebec and B.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405965">On the question of the proposal to add plastic manufactured items to schedule 1 of the CEPA, this is an important step to allow us to manage the waste and pollution caused by plastic products. We conducted a science assessment of plastic pollution. Its core findings are that microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and harmful to wildlife and habitat. Canadians see the effects of plastic pollution in their communities and waterways. They see the volumes of plastic waste being discarded and they expect the government to take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405966"> The proposal to list plastic manufactured items on schedule 1 of CEPA would enable the government to take measures to address the pollution and waste along the life cycle of plastics and protect our environment, while also moving Canada to a more circular resource-efficient economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405967">The government does not believe that this action hurts Albertans or any other Canadians. On the contrary, acting to better manage plastic waste will keep plastics in the economy and out of Canada's environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405968"> Minister Wilkinson, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">minister of environment</Affiliation>, recently released, for consultation, a discussion paper that provides an overview of the government's proposed next steps. It contains a framework to address single-use plastics along with a proposed list of six single-use items to either ban or restrict as well as a proposal for the establishment of recycled content requirements in products and packaging. This latter action aims to drive investment in recycling infrastructure and spur innovation in technology and product design.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405969"> We want to support the growth of the Canadian recycling industry, boost overall economic growth and create new jobs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. All of these proposed actions have the potential to complement and accelerate progress toward Alberta's goal to become a centre of excellence for plastics recycling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405970"> The government wants to hear from Canadians and stakeholders on its proposed approach to address plastic pollution and waste. The comments received will help shape the choices on the path forward to a more circular economy for plastics.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405978">Madam Speaker, in Adjournment Proceedings this evening, I am pursuing a question for which I did not receive an adequate answer on November 20. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405979">I asked about the new legislation before us, Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which proclaims itself as a net-zero climate accountability act. It fails on almost every point. The Green caucus is struggling with how to handle it. We want so very much to support climate accountability, but we struggle with whether we can even vote for this legislation at second reading to send it to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405980">Here is what the legislation must do as the bottom line requirement to be called accountability on net zero for climate action: We have to get the science right, we have to get the process right and we have to get the accountability right. Right now, it has three strikes and this legislation is out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405981">Getting the science right means that in the preamble, one does not cite one aspect of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change science, that to hold to 1.5°C we must have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, all the while ignoring the closer-term reality of the emergency and the urgency. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also says that to have any hope of holding to 1.5°C, we need massive reductions in greenhouse gases in the next decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405982">It is not an even pace of having three decades so we take our time and do it in even bits every 10 years. No, we cannot do that. Most of the heavy lifting has to be done before 2030. That is not clear in the legislation. As a matter of fact, it is denied by the way the legislation is structured with a first milestone year in 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405983">Next is getting the process right. I am honestly baffled that the Liberal government appears to have ignored the experience garnered in other countries with climate accountability legislation. The U.K. has had its legislation since 2008. There are lessons to be learned there. Similarly, New Zealand, which brought in its legislation, learned from the U.K.'s experience, as did Denmark. All of the climate accountability legislation in countries where it is working has relied on expert advice. To the extent they have an advisory group, they are experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405984">This legislation wants to have an advisory body that seems to be another version of a multistakeholder group without expertise. That is a very significant error. I like multistakeholder groups. I used to be vice-chair of the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, which was destroyed and repealed. It was originally put in place by the Mulroney government, by the way, and it was repealed under Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> in the spring of 2012. We should bring a national round table or something like that back, but not through the back door of Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, where we need expertise, not multistakeholder advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405985">The third area of accountability that fails is having the mechanisms to hold the government to account and getting them right. This bill does not use mandatory language around the minister meeting a target. It is interesting. I have been conferring with colleagues in New Zealand and they are looking at saying, if the target is missed, that means the government will have to make up what it missed by buying credits and paying for them. Their finance department is getting ready to book the costs of missing the target. Therefore, there is a financial penalty and the government will then be keeping its eye on the ball to avoid that penalty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405986">The bottom line here is that the Paris Agreement now has the support of the United States, President-elect Joe Biden has appointed a high-level special envoy in John Kerry. Canada should be jumping up right now to be bold and ambitious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405987">This bill is not what we need. I hope we can see changes before it comes back at third stage and report stage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405988">Madam Speaker, the immediate priority of the government is to support Canadians through the pandemic. However, we are also planning strategically for how to promote economic prosperity while also addressing the global crisis of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405989">Canadians are experiencing the impacts of climate change and the government understands the urgent need to take action and ensure that sustainability is built into all aspects of our economy. This is critical for Canadians today and for our future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405990">We are making progress through Canada's current climate plan, the pan-Canadian framework. This plan is projected to achieve a historic level of emissions reductions, but we know we need to do more. That is why the government has committed to exceeding its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions targets, and putting the country on a path to prosper in a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405991">We have also committed to bringing forward a new NDC emission reduction target by 2030, prior to COP26 in November 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405992">To reach these targets, we are strengthening existing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and introduce new ones. The 2020 fall economic statement announced some of these new measures, and our work to build back better will make the economy greener, more inclusive, more resilient and more competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405993">Investments include putting climate action at the centre of our plan to create a million new jobs; bolstering training support for those hit hardest by the pandemic, including marginalized and racialized women, indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, and new Canadians; and proposing to provide up to 700,000 grants to homeowners to help them make energy efficient improvements to their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405994">We are committed to investing in Canada's clean power supply and working to connect Canadians with clean electricity across the country. We are investing in zero-emission vehicles, including charging and refuelling infrastructure. The Government of Canada is also working to develop a well-functioning, sustainable finance market in Canada. We are also prioritizing investments in nature-based solutions, including plans to plant two billion trees over 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405995"> We are investing in climate-smart, natural solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to ecosystem loss, and we are committing new funding to support climate solutions for agriculture. In the coming weeks, the government will bring these and other elements together in a coherent, enhanced climate plan, providing Canadians with transparency as to how Canada will exceed its current 2030 Paris Agreement targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405996">After the proposed plan is released, we will be consulting with our partners, indigenous peoples, provinces and territories, municipalities, industry and civil society. These consultations will inform the development of Canada's updated 2030 target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405997"> I would like to thank the hon. member for her commitment to increased climate action. I look forward to working with the member, our colleagues and Canadians as we work towards bringing forward a plan that will enable Canada to exceed our 2030 targets and help set Canada on a path to achieving a prosperous net-zero emissions future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6405998">Madam Speaker, when the hon. member refers to our Paris targets, the number he is referring to is that from the third time that Stephen Harper weakened our target. It is the weakest of the three Harper targets, and we still have it five years after an election. I find this not just baffling but tragic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6405999">The Government of Canada committed in Paris, in the COP decision document, that we would increase our 2030 target this year, in 2020, not merely before COP26 next year, but this year, when we have vanishing days left for us to fulfill our international obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6406000">We have a short time left. The window closing on 1.5°C will close in the coming years, well before 2030. If it closes, it closes for good, and it closes for our children the opportunity to have a livable world. The stakes could not be higher. The government has to do better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6406001">Madam Speaker, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions need to decline rapidly over the next three decades according to scientific experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6406002">The Paris Agreement calls for governments around the world to take urgent and ambitious action on climate change to keep global warming well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to keep it below 1.5°C in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6406003">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its special report on global warming of 1.5°C in 2018. That report concluded that global emissions need to reach net zero around mid-century for there to be a reasonable chance of meeting the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6406004">On November 19, the minister tabled the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability bill, which, if passed, would legally bind the government to a process to achieve net zero by 2050. It would make our 2030 target legally binding, and set five-year emission reduction targets to 2050 to improve accountability and transparency. We look forward to working with all the parties to pass this important legislation and strengthen our 2030 targets.</ParaText>
