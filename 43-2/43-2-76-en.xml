              <ParaText id="6581835">This is in regard to one of the greatest little airports in the world. It is the Gander International Airport. In the 20th century, it was the most notable for being one of the largest airports around World War II. It was built for that reason. Of course, in this century, it became famous for welcoming all those stranded passengers on 9/11 and inspiring the great musical <I>Come From Away</I>. It is currently in financial trouble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581836"> The petition calls on the Government of Canada to help it out in this time of need, as it is still, to this day, an essential service, not just for central Newfoundland but the entire province, the east coast and, as we have proven, an international asset for aviation safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581837">We call on the government to help central Newfoundland in particular, and the Gander International Airport. As Reg Wright, the CEO of the airport, once said, it is the airport that was built for battle and now needs a bit of help.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6581839">The petitioners point out that the opioid crisis is one of the most deadly public health emergencies of our lifetime, with a death taking place every two hours and a death toll of over 15,400 in the past four years alone. As the overdose crisis rages, they call on the government to declare the overdose crisis a national public health emergency; to take steps to end those overdose deaths and overdose injuries; to immediately collaborate with provinces and territories to develop a comprehensive, pan-Canadian overdose action plan; to ensure that any plan considers reforms that other countries have used, such as legalization, decriminalization and changes to flawed drug policies; and to ensure this emergency is taken seriously, with adequate funding and program supports.</ParaText>

They recognize that the 2017 national housing strategy did not include any specific funding, strategies or policies for urban or rural indigenous housing, even though the mandate letter from the <Affiliation DbId="253372" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> specifically outlined such a strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581846"> The Canadian Housing and Renewal Association and its indigenous caucus have put forward a number of suggestions for the government to act on. This includes for the government to develop a “For Indigenous, By Indigenous” national housing centre; to increase the supply of stable, safe, affordable housing by building 73,000 new units of housing for urban, rural and northern indigenous peoples; to support the tenants' well-being and long-term success with wraparound indigenous services; and to accelerate action on indigenous homelessness; and to focus on northern housing.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6581870">Mr. Speaker, we are here today to move along business that we started last summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581871"> It was last summer that Canadians first learned about the WE scandal involving the Liberal government. This is the scandal of the WE organization paying members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family half a million dollars and then being awarded, in an untendered agreement, half a billion dollars of taxpayer funds as part of a proposed or planned pandemic relief program for students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581872">We heard many different things at the time, both from the PMO and from the WE organization, including that members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family had never been paid. Then, of course, that story changed over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581873">When hearings began last summer and members of the opposition began to get answers for Canadians, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament, effectively killing the work of those committees. At the time he said that when the House resumed in the fall, there would be lots of time for questions. There was certainly lots of time, and that time was spent by Liberal members filibustering across multiple committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581874">At the ethics committee alone, the filibuster lasted for the equivalent of 20 meetings. When that filibuster finally ended and we were able to order witnesses to appear, it was December. In December, we initiated that process, but the government's partners in this deal, the founders of the WE organization, Craig and Marc Kielburger, took until March to agree to appear at the committee, and then eventually said they would not, even if summoned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581875"> A summons was issued to them, and they did appear. During that appearance, we heard more contradictions to previous testimony and sought to have more witnesses called as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581876"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s testimony in the summer was before the heavily redacted document dump that came on the eve of the cover-up prorogation in August, and so here was no opportunity for members to compare and contrast the answers given by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his chief of staff, other witnesses from cabinet, and the information that was in that document release. As more information has come out, the need for more questions to be asked has come to pass, and we need these witnesses to appear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581877">I should note, before I mention the defence committee, that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252522" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation>. He sits on the defence committee and is the shadow minister for defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581878">This is happening at the same time that the defence committee is dealing with the study with respect to sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces. The allegations it is dealing with concern the former chief of the defence staff. The former chief of the defence staff is alleged to have perpetrated sexual misconduct. It was reported to the Canadian Forces ombudsman in 2018. That information was relayed to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, at which point one would expect that a thorough investigation would be undertaken, one that would include the appropriate authorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581879">However, a blind eye was turned. Instead, the alleged perpetrator was given a raise by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and the victims were left without justice. Other members of our Canadian Armed Forces are left wondering what protections are being afforded them by the government that they serve with unlimited liability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581880">It is important to note that members of our Canadian Armed Forces serve this country with unlimited liability. They ask very little of us in return, but guaranteeing them a workplace that is free from sexual misconduct, particularly when it is perpetrated by Canada's top soldier, seems like the least we could do for them. However, that is not the case, so members of the defence committee have looked for a witness to appear. Those efforts have been blocked.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6581881">There was a due diligence report with respect to the Canada student service grant that was committed by the Privy Council. That report was not tabled with the committee, so we are seeking that information as well with this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581882">It is important to note how we came to this point. With dozens of hours wasted to filibustering and dozens of meetings lost to delays and obstruction, parliamentarians were not able to fully engage in the defence, finance, PROC or ethics committees, among other committees. I was going to make it an either/or between the defence and ethics committees, but the filibusters were across multiple committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581883">The study at the ethics committee has to do with pandemic spending. We had intended to wrap this study up in the fall, but of course those obstructions prevented us from doing so and prevented us from getting on to the other important work that the committee intended to undertake, such as to protect victims of sexual exploitation online and to examine emerging technologies, such as facial recognition, as is the mandate of our committee, and the defence committee barely has its feet under it in the study with respect to sexual misconduct in the military. It is facing a brick wall from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581884">It is tremendously concerning that when it comes to accountability and how the government spends the public's money. Half a billion dollars in support for students was originally billed as $912 million, but members of the Liberal Party do not want answers and accountability for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581885">It is alleged that this program was designed to help students. They could have devoted those funds to the Canada summer jobs program, which was already in place, with some modifications that were made to it last year, but instead of committing those funds to an established, tried, tested program, the Liberals cooked up something new and gave it to friends of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They let down all of those students who did not have employment opportunities, and in fact let down the business owners who could have benefited from having the labour of the students who would gain experience when they were already facing hard times. These businesses would have had subsidized labour in that time, and the charitable sector also missed out by not having the volunteers that were promised in that program. The Canadians who were let down in that process make up a laundry list. It is incumbent on us to get answers on how that came to pass. We need to find out what happened so that it does not happen again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581886">We are looking at another budget. It is the first time I have been able to say that in years. We have not had a budget here in over two years, and we want to make sure, when we go through that process, that that we do not see the government set to repeat the same mistakes that we have seen over the past year in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581887">The opposition is looking for a very measured result from today's motion, and that result is to have witnesses appear at committee to testify on studies at those committees. We have to devote a supply day to this. Earlier this week we used one of our opposition supply days to talk about what the government's plan was, asking for it to table a plan for the House and for all Canadians to see on coming out of the pandemic. A year ago, it was reasonable to say that there were some things the government might not have planned for. There was some things it could have planned for and did not, but now, with a year's experience, it ought to have a plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581888">Today we are looking to make committees work and we are looking to make the House work, so we are asking for these witnesses to appear. Of course, if it is the position of the government that these witnesses should not appear, then there is the option for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to appear at committee. The choice is certainly the government's to make. The opposition has made the choice to make Parliament work, and I hope that all members of the House vote with us to make the House of Commons work and to make committees work so that we can get answers for Canadians on how their money was spent and so that we can ensure that we have a safe, respectful work environment for all members of our Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>

We cannot count on the ministers. We are going to have to hear from their staff.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6581898">Mr. Speaker, I received an extraordinary letter on Twitter last night from the lawyer representing WE's financial people, attacking us on Twitter for the fact that they have not answered a number of key questions about how the organization works, about financial connections and about how many schools were actually built. I would say for any member of the House that after eight months, Parliament has no clue as to how the financial operations of WE work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581899">However, I would like to raise a question that was in the letter. The lawyer stated that answering the question about how many schools they actually built would require months of work and an analysis of thousands of pages of documents. This is a group that told children to give them $10,000 and they would build a school, and that for every $10,000 they would build a school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581900">I ask my hon. colleague if he does not think that a multi-million-dollar charity would simply have a list of how many schools it has actually built, and that it would be fairly straightforward to say that it was given this money and built these schools? Instead, we are getting these letters from lawyers on Twitter.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6581908">Mr. Speaker, my thanks to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> for bringing this motion to the floor. I think it is important that we demonstrate to Canadians that the Liberals are blocking the work of parliamentary committees, and that they are stopping us from getting to the bottom of some very serious scandals within the Liberal government, including the WE scandal and the sad case of sexual misconduct by the top officers in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581909">There is talk about ministerial accountability, but then we have ministers who refuse to be accountable. That is why we need to hear from key witnesses, including their staff and chiefs of staff, so that we can shine the sunlight and show Canadians the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581910">Looking at the coordinated effort by the government to stop committees from hearing from witnesses and getting to the bottom of what is actually taking place, it is evident that Liberal members would rather protect their political skins and their political staff than protect those who serve us in uniform. It has become abundantly clear. With revelations of sexual misconduct allegations against the former chief of the defence staff, General Jonathan Vance, and the allegations against the current chief of the defence staff, Admiral Art McDonald, it is all too obvious that the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces have a serious and ongoing problem with stomping out sexual misconduct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581911">We ask a lot of the brave men and women who serve us in uniform and, in return, we as parliamentarians have a duty to protect those people who have sworn an oath to protect all of us. We cannot allow our daughters, sisters and mothers to work in these unsafe environments. No one should ever be subjected to sexual harassment when they show up to serve our nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581912">I want specifically to address the part of the motion calling the former chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, Zita Astravas, before our national defence committee. She is currently the chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">minister of public safety</Affiliation>. On February 9, revelations had already come to light that General Vance was alleged to have not conducted himself with honour: he had sent an email to a subordinate that was sexual in nature, and that information had been presented to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> on March 1, 2018. When those revelations came out in early February, we had an emergency meeting of the national defence committee and we brought forward a motion calling a number of witnesses to appear, including Zita Astravas. Nothing ever came of the invitation that was extended to her, dating back to February 9.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581913">Fast forward a month, and we had a situation with allegations coming out against Admiral Art McDonald. We had expanded the study and we brought forward the motion to again call Zita Astravas to appear. Originally we asked to summon her, because it had already been a month since she had actually been at committee and she had refused to appear, so that time we wanted to issue a summons. That was amended by members of the committee to invite her once again. Here we are, almost a full four weeks after that time, and she has not yet appeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581914">On Monday, March 22, we brought forward a motion at committee to summon her, to ensure that she did appear to speak to this issue. Again, the Liberals stood and filibustered for a couple of hours to prevent the motion from being carried. It is a sad state when we have government members stopping witnesses from appearing on something as disgusting as sexual misconduct within the Canadian Armed Forces. They would rather block hearing from witnesses than stand up for the brave men and women in uniform.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6581915">I can also confirm that the clerk of the national defence committee has called Ms. Astravas's office at Public Safety. He has left voice mails, he has gone through the PMO switchboard and he has also sent emails. Ms. Astravas has not returned any of those calls or emails. That is why it is so important that today's motion passes: so we can finally get to the bottom of what Zita Astravas knew. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581916">We know that on March 1, 2018, when Gary Walbourne, the former ombudsman, presented the evidence to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, the minister pushed away from the table and said no. He mumbled something about maybe having the ombudsman take it to the National Investigation Service. We know the very next day that his chief of staff, Zita Astravas, reached out to the PCO, the Privy Council Office. We know that they also talked to PMO senior adviser Elder Marques, who has agreed to appear before committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581917">There is mounting evidence that Zita Astravas was involved in what happened with that information after the meeting, when it was presented in confidence by Gary Walbourne to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. Rather, she took that information and shared it with who knows who. We need to talk to her about everyone who was brought into the loop. It could have included Katie Telford, who is chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It definitely could have involved the Clerk, and we know it involved the Deputy Clerk of cabinet in the Privy Council Office. There is so much out there that we need to dig down on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581918">The stories from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> on the sexual misconduct allegations against General Vance continue to change. When this news first broke on February 4, the Prime Minister and the defence minister were pretty much saying that they were not aware of these allegations prior to what was reported in the news. That is false, because we know that evidence was presented to the minister on March 1, 2018, and the Prime Minister later said that he and his office were aware on February 24. They keep changing their stories. He admitted in question period on March 10 that he knew there were allegations, but did not know the content of the allegations. That is not good enough. If they were aware of those allegations on March 1, 2018, why did they extend General Vance's contract by three years and why did he get a raise of $50,000? Where are the facts on this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581919">If we look at the testimony of Gary Walbourne, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> refused to talk at committee about private conversations with the ombudsman, and then he pushed away from the table when he was presented with evidence. He now admits that he would not look at the evidence and said it would have been political interference if he had gotten involved in the investigation. Gary Walbourne said yesterday that was “bizarre” and “weak”. That is not a proper excuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581920">Yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> directed the Royal Canadian Navy to look into an investigation they did of a comment about a red room on a Zoom call, which implied sexual misconduct. The Minister of National Defence cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that he cannot be politically involved and then give instructions to review an investigation. This is a cover-up at the highest levels. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Minister of National Defence refuse to be accountable. There was the big raise and the extension for General Vance, who was overseeing Operation Honour, which was signed off on by the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581921">We need to find out if Zita Astravas waved any red flags to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, the Prime Minister's Office, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the PCO to stop the raise. Was she complicit? Were all of them complicit? We cannot forget about the role of Richard Fadden in all of this. When we heard about these rumours in 2015, the national security adviser, Richard Fadden, investigated them. When this happened with the current Prime Minister's Office and the PCO, they did not even talk to Daniel Jean, who was the national security adviser. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581922">All of this is so sad, and it is important that we address this going forward and have witnesses appear at committee so we can get to the bottom of the facts and to the truth.</ParaText>

We thoroughly investigated the rumour and the allegations of fraternization when General Vance was posted in NATO at Naples.

              <ParaText id="6581956"> It is critical to point out that there was much debate about the decision by the government to send ministers to committees rather than staff.

              <ParaText id="6581963">We know now how the opposition treats staff who do not have the privilege and immunities that members enjoy. Their actions speak for themselves. Members of this House are protected from intimidation through our parliamentary privilege. It is totally irresponsible for members to turn this protection into weapons against those who are not covered by these protections. Not only is it irresponsible, it is a clear abuse of power.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6581968">Calling for staff to appear before a committee is not the only case of the opposition behaving this way during this Parliament. It has been using its majority at committees to call for the production of papers, which is fine, as that is its right and its job, while questioning the neutrality and integrity of the public service. It is refusing to trust the non-partisan public servants to redact documents. At the finance committee, the Conservatives wanted to find public servants guilty without even hearing from them. How low can they go? They have undermined faith in the public service as an institution during a pandemic, which is not the time for Canadians to lose trust in our institutions. The Conservatives are playing a very dangerous game.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6581969">I want to take a moment to step back and provide a few other examples of the irresponsible behaviour of the opposition, and there are many. To be honest, we had to choose. The deputy leader of the Conservative Party posted a telephone number of a private company on social media and encouraged Canadians to call and demand that the company break Canada's privacy laws and release information. This led to harassment and personal threats that left employees fearing for their personal safety and required the police to get involved. Moreover, the Conservative ethics critic sent a letter to a private company asking it to break the law. The opposition tried to compel the release of personal information of private citizens. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582004">Hearing the government House leader tell us just now that the ministers are responsible and accountable and that it is not up to their staff to answer for them was music to my ears. I completely agree with him. It would make no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582005">The problem is not that we disagree on the principles, it is that they do not walk the talk. The minister can tell us that he is responsible and that he is taking care of all this, but he and the government are not dealing with the situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582006">We spent the better part of last summer on the WE scandal. We were making such good progress that we were starting to shed light on the matter. The only thing the government could come up with was to prorogue Parliament to prevent the committee from continuing its work. We were forced to stop, and when the work resumed, they still kept us waiting for the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582007">Last summer, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the former finance minister whether due diligence had been done before the government invested in WE Charity. They said that yes, it probably had. When I spoke to Mr. Shugart, the Clerk of the Privy Council, he confirmed that due diligence had been done. I asked him to send us the due diligence report, and he promised to do so. However, we never received it. That is an important document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582008">When someone invests money, regardless of the amount, they need to know who they are doing business with. If I have $2,000 to put into an RRSP, I am not going to give that money to the first peddler who comes along without knowing who he is and what he is going to do with my money. I make sure to give my money to a bank or trust, a responsible organization that is going to manage my money responsibly and ensure that I am not wasting it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582009">When the government, which manages my taxes, decides to invest my money, I expect it to be at least as diligent as I am, if not more. Normally, when someone is managing other people's money, they should be even more careful than when they are managing their own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582010">The WE Charity contract was not a $2,000 deal. It was a contract for $43 million, possibly more because of the potential for subcontracts. Clearly WE Charity was willing to subcontract the work. It gave National a contract and could have given contracts to its other organizations, such as ME to WE, and other shell corporations. We were shown quite an extensive organizational chart, actually. There was at least $43 million involved, plus more for student grants that could have totalled almost $1 billion. It could have been as much as $904 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582011">It was the middle of the pandemic, so the government decided it did not have time to manage the program and would not bother with a tendering process, which is due diligence 101. It awarded the contract to the only organization it thought could provide the service: WE Charity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582012">The Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics and the Standing Committee on Finance heard from experts who said that a tender is essential but that if the situation is truly beyond one's control and a tender is not possible, even greater vigilance is needed. Based on what we know so far, the government, which should have been even more vigilant than usual, awarded the contract having done no due diligence whatsoever. It awarded a $43-million contract without checking into the recipient at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582013">Then there was another emergency. We parliamentarians kept digging and realized that WE Charity, the entity the government had entrusted with $43 million of our money, was just a shell corporation. It was a new company. The Kielburger brothers are no fools. Their lawyer informed them that this was a big contract worth up to $1 billion and that they would be paid $43 million. The idea, then, was to put this into a separate company, because if the deal ever fell through, they did not want WE Charity to go belly up too. That was the plan in a nutshell, and I did not make it up. The Kielburger brothers told us the story themselves.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582014"> Their lawyers are the ones who recommended that they put $43 million into a new shell corporation, with no financial history, to manage nearly $1 billion, without due diligence or a tendering process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582015">What did we learn as we kept digging? We learned that the corporation in question was not even capable of providing services in French. Everyone likes to talk about how Canada is this great bilingual country, but that is pure fiction. Yet again, the government is all talk and no action on languages, as on everything else. The organization was not capable of providing services in French, so it was forced to subcontract services in Quebec to National.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582016">What else did we learn as we dug deeper into this scandal? We found out that people from WE Charity had helped the government design this program. The people who wanted to get paid for deciding where our money should go were telling the government what to put in the contract that they would then be awarded. On top of that, they were told to put it in a shell corporation so that they would not lose anything if the project were to fail. Unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582017">Not only were they the ones designing the program, but what else did we learn? The people who were telling the government how to design the program were not even registered as lobbyists. No one from WE Charity was registered as a lobbyist. However, certain individuals were working with public servants every day to design a program that would get them a $43-million contract. That is hardly small potatoes</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582018">The icing on the cake is that by asking questions, we learned that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the finance minister at the time were in a conflict of interest when they issued that contract. The worst part is that they were aware of it. They knew that they should not get involved, but they did so anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582019">There was an initial cabinet meeting, as the Prime Minister testified last summer. He saw the subject on the agenda and said that he was not sure he could get involved because he was in a conflict of interest. He knew the Kielburgers, and his family, namely his mother, brother and wife, had received contracts worth approximately half a million dollars from them. In order to reassure the Prime Minister, the meeting was postponed for two weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582020">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> then had two weeks to think. Nevertheless, he and the then finance minister ended up voting on a contract in which they had a conflict of interest, a contract that was problematic for all the reasons I just outlined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582021">They do not want to answer our questions. They prorogue Parliament when they think we are asking too many questions. We therefore put our questions to the Kielburger brothers, who confirmed a few things. One of the brothers—I believe it was Marc Kielburger—confirmed that he had sent a message through LinkedIn to several employees in the department, thanking them for working with him to shape the program. The government, meanwhile, tells us that everything is fine, that it prepared the program itself, without any help from WE Charity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582022">WE says that it was thanking public servants for preparing it. We want to get to the bottom of this. If the ministers do not want to give us an answer, we will ask the employees involved, the ones the Kielburger brothers referred to. We want to ask them what really went on, but we are being told that the ministers have to take responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582023">I agree with the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation>. I would love to see the ministers take responsibility. That is music to my ears. I invite them to testify before the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics and to answer for their staff. However, they must actually give an answer. They cannot do what they have been doing over the past few months, such as sending 5,000 pages of redacted documents, including 349 pages that, according to the law clerk, were redacted in a way that did not comply with the committee's instructions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582024">I hope they will not prorogue Parliament or call an election to prevent us from continuing our work. They must stop beating around the bush. They must take responsibility. Unfortunately, we have lost faith in them. At this point, we are determined to get to the bottom of this matter. It is taxpayers' money, and it is not peanuts. We are talking about $43 million to manage almost $1 billion. We want to hear from those responsible for this program. I want to see the due diligence report that we have been promised since August. <I /></ParaText>

That seems to be a standard reply. In other words, committees can decide how to conduct their business. However, today, we have the revelation that he does not really think that anymore.

In fact, I did not mention this in my introductory speech, but I was surprised by what the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> said. I have a great deal of respect for him because we can trust him on his word. He is intelligent and honest and a man of integrity.

It is quite unusual for a minister to tell his employees to disobey committee orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582029">I would like an explanation on this. I think this is pretty serious. My colleague is absolutely right. It is one thing to say that you take responsibility, but it is another thing to do it. When the committees call on the ministers, it is not to get together for a cup of coffee. It is to honestly answer questions without beating around the bush. If the committee thinks it is important to hear testimony from officials, then it is the minister's job to tell his employees that they must obey the orders. He must certainly not encourage them to revolt against the orders given by the committee. It makes no sense. I have too much respect for the leader—</ParaText>

The Liberals dragged their feet on the Canada emergency student benefit. We had to twist their arms. They broke their promise to pay the interest fees on student loans. They completely mismanaged the program. There were conflicts of interest and oversights, and students ultimately paid the price.</ParaText>

Based on what we were told, WE Charity has reimbursed all the money it was given, so there may be no loss there. We need to look into that, but that is the information we have now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582036">I think the program was a good idea initially. Getting students who need to earn money into the labour market and, by the same token, helping organizations that need workers is a good idea. I have nothing against good ideas. I do have something against the insidious way they tried to do it. To be blunt, the government was trying to help its friends. WE Charity helped Mr. Trudeau's family, and Mr. Trudeau's family helped WE Charity in return. The really despicable part is that they claimed they wanted to help students and organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582037">I agree that we should help students and organizations. In fact, I do that myself. I help organizations in my riding. For example, I participate in the various events that they organize. I try my best to help them. I think they need help, especially during the pandemic. As for students, there is no question that we should help them. I will reiterate that the program is not the problem. The problem is the way the program was implemented. It was not done properly. Basically, helping students was just a pretext. The real objective was to help WE Charity. That is what was done.</ParaText>

I will focus on three aspects. I will begin with a brief history of the issue and the reason why the Standing Committee on the Status of Women is studying it. I will then talk about the current debates, before concluding with a few hopes for the future and for the follow-up to the investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582047">In 2015, former justice Marie Deschamps published a devastating report on sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces, which led to an article by Noémi Mercier in L’actualité. That same year, shortly after the Deschamps report was released, the Conservative Party appointed General Jonathan Vance chief of the defence staff. As Ray Novak, former chief of staff to Stephen Harper, confirmed, allegations of sexual misconduct were already circulating when Mr. Vance appeared before the national defence committee in 2015. The Conservatives called for an investigation, which found that nothing inappropriate had taken place. Mr. Vance’s appointment was then confirmed. Immediately after he was appointed chief of the defence staff, General Vance launched Operation Honour, aimed at eliminating sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582048">In 2018, former Canadian Forces ombudsman Gary Walbourne received a complaint against Mr. Vance supported by evidence deemed credible. The victim, however, did not want to go any further, which prevented the ombudsman from pursuing the investigation. His hands tied, on March 1, 2018, Mr. Walbourne tried to warn the Liberal Minister of National Defence and show him the evidence of General Vance’s inappropriate behaviour. The minister apparently refused to look at the incriminating documents or discuss the matter with the ombudsman. This is clear evidence of the government’s lack of transparency, which it tried to hide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582049">Mr. Walbourne described the meeting as hostile. The minister apparently refused to speak with him seven times, until Mr. Walbourne retired. It seems the Minister of Defence simply had his chief of staff at the time, Zita Astravas, notify the Privy Council of the allegations, without following up in any way or calling for an investigation. An email from Mrs. Astravas dated March 5, 2018, confirmed that the Minister of Defence heard the allegations against Mr. Vance and that she herself forwarded the information to the Privy Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582050">In 2019, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women looked into the matter just before the end of the session when the general election was called. The study was put on hold. When we tried to refer the study back to the committee, the Liberals first tried to say that the matter should not be considered in two committees, and that the Standing Committee on National Defence could do the job. At first, the government even tried to hide from the Standing Committee on the Status of Women that members wanted to address this feminist angle from the start.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582051">Now we are finally discussing it. The study started last Tuesday, but we had to work hard to be able to discuss this aspect, the treatment of women in the Canadian Armed Forces. The Standing Committee on the Status of Women can now examine the issue from that angle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582052">Let us go over the timeline of events. General Vance announced his retirement on July 23, 2020. On February 2, Global News reported that allegations of sexual misconduct had been made against General Vance. The Standing Committee on National Defence looked into the matter, paying particular attention to the actions of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, who had known for three years that General Vance was the subject of serious allegations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582053">When the Minister of National Defence first appeared before the committee, he systematically refused to answer questions on the pretext that the case was before the courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582054">The testimony of Gary Walbourne, who confirmed that he had informed the Minister of National Defence and that the minister had not even wanted to look at the file, was a real black eye for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582055">Other witnesses at committee confirmed that the minister should have taken action and that he had several tools at his disposal to order an inquiry. None of the witnesses could understand why the minister failed to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582056">The Minister of National Defence appeared before the committee again in March. This time, he agreed to speak in order to defend his handling of the case. He admitted that he had refused to look at Walbourne's file, claiming that he did not want to do the investigating himself, though no one was asking him to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582057">One of the missing links for finding out exactly what happened and what the Liberal government did, or rather did not do, is the Minister of National Defence's former chief of staff, Zita Astravas, who is currently serving as chief of staff for the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation>. She was the one handling the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582058">The committee tried to contact her several times to invite her to testify, but she never even responded. The committee tried to force her to appear, but the Liberals wanted to invite her again rather than force her. The Conservative motion was defeated by the Bloc and the Liberals. The Bloc Québécois wanted to give her one last chance before forcing her to appear because, let us be frank, that is an extreme measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582059">I remind members that the Trudeau government had no problem dragging Mark Norman, second in command, through the mud. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> even said twice that the case would be going to court, while Mr. Norman wanted to sound the alarm about Scott Brison's plot to withdraw the <I>Asterix</I> contract from the Davie shipyard to help his buddies at Irving. There is a double standard here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582060">The Crown finally dropped the charges and Scott Brison resigned.

              <ParaText id="6582065">Mr. Speaker, I am on target for time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582066">Since Tuesday, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women has resumed its study of the issue of sexual misconduct. The Standing Committee on National Defence is also examining it. Our first witness was the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, who basically repeated that he found these allegations concerning and disturbing, yet he did nothing about them for over three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582067">The Department of National Defence, meanwhile, continues to say that sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces is unacceptable. While Operation Honour was supposed to reduce the number of sexual assaults, we now know that senior officers have committed assaults with impunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582068">Because generals outrank military judges and cannot be disciplined by anyone in the Canadian Armed Forces, we are now seeing many cases of sexual misconduct at the highest levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582069">General Vance, the former chief of the defence staff who launched Operation Honour, had already been accused of sexual misconduct back in 2018. According to former ombudsman Gary Walbourne, the defence minister refused to even look at the incriminating evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582070">That the defence minister did nothing for nearly three years is quite troubling. By failing to take action against the highest-ranking officers, the government chose to protect the generals instead of the victims who were in the worst work environments possible. Members of the military are subject to the Code of Service Discipline, which means that the senior officers are in a position of power over the members. It is therefore easy for the officers to abuse their power and their subordinates, a point that was mentioned on Tuesday in the Standing Committee on Status of Women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582071">The Bloc Québécois believes it is important to learn from the General Vance case, to prevent such things from happening again. The Bloc Québécois is in favour of the motion to have the defence and status of women committees study this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582072">In conclusion, some solutions could be implemented, but it will take political will to make the Canadian Armed Forces safe again for women and to break the culture of silence. You cannot call yourself a feminist and continue to tolerate sexual violence in the Canadian army. For all these reasons, I believe it is high time we took action. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6582100">Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to join the debate today, albeit not from within the House itself but from within my constituency of Edmonton Strathcona. I will be splitting my time today with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582101">This is a long motion, so I am going to speak about a number of different portions of it. I am going to start by talking about the committee work and the important, vital role committees play in our parliamentary democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582102">We heard from the government that it is the opposition that is causing problems and preventing committees from doing their work. I have to flag that I just do not see this as accurate. We know committees must be empowered and we know they must be independent, but they are not able to do their work right now because of obstruction from Liberal members of these committees. A perfect example is the committee on which I sit, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. Sitting on this committee for the last few weeks, I have been listening to members of the Liberal Party talking about their cats, about cutting their lawns and about a number of different things in order to not have to discuss the very important issue of global vaccine equity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582103">At the committee I would like to talk about vaccines, about how they are being dispersed around the world and how we are making sure dangerous variants appearing around the world are not endangering Canadians. I want to talk about why we do not have national capacity to develop vaccines in Canada. I want to talk about why we are the only G7 country taking vaccines from poorer countries through the COVAX program, despite having negotiated 10 times what we need through bilateral agreements. However, we cannot talk about that because the Liberals have been filibustering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582104">What is even more disturbing is that while I would love to talk about what I think is one of the most important issues of the moment, which is the equality of vaccine distribution, the committee also needs to be talking about all the things happening around the world. The committee needs to be talking about arms sales to Saudi Arabia. It needs to be talking about what is happening with China, Hong Kong and Myanmar, and what is happening with Yemen, which is named as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. We cannot do that work either, because of the obstruction by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582105">When we hear the government say it is in fact the opposition that is preventing it, it is very clear to me that this is in fact not the case. It is the filibustering, the withholding of documents, the redacting of documents and the obstructing of work. Our democracy is in a very sad state when we are not being enabled to do the work we need to do. Because the NDP strongly supports anything that adds to the transparency and accountability of the government, I will certainly be supporting this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582106">The next thing I want to talk about is the WE scandal and some of the things that have happened around the WE scandal. As an NDP member, I have been very pleased over the pandemic to see the support we have been able to get the government to agree to for Canadians. The CERB was always just going to be a tweak on EI, but the NDP was able to convince the government to make it $2,000 and extend it into the CRB. We knew the wage subsidy was going to be 10%; we convinced the government to get it to 75%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582107">The rent program was a deeply flawed program because it was landlord-driven, but we were able to convince the government to fix it. Of course, we were not able to get it applied back retroactively to April, so many constituencies and many businesses in Edmonton Strathcona really suffered, but we were able to get a program for people. We were able to get support for seniors and for people living with disabilities, and we are really proud of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582108"> We were also able to get some support for students. There was the CESB and there was a moratorium on student loan repayments, but we lost the thread there. In June, there was a huge announcement that there was going to be all this money for students. It was going to be great and help students. We knew they were suffering. We knew that not every student came from a wealthy family and that not every student was getting the support they needed, and they were not able to work over the summer, something they needed to do, so we were delighted to hear about the supports. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582109">However, I was very concerned when I heard the organization being used to develop this program was the WE Charity. As someone who has worked for over 25 years in international development, I was very disappointed when I heard Mr. Trudeau defend the partnership, saying that WE was the only group with a countrywide network capable of operating—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582113">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> defended the partnership, saying that WE was the only group with a countrywide network capable of operating a program on this scale for young people. That was not true. That was very clearly not true. As someone who has worked in the sector, I can tell members that there are a number of organizations that could have done that much better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582114">I can also tell members that the WE organization is not a good international development charity. There is a reason that it is not part of any charitable umbrella group. There is a reason that it is not seen as a player within the sector. It does bad development work. It takes advantage of students. To be perfectly honest, it is basically the Liberal equivalent of a charity: it is all glitter and no substance, or, as we say in Alberta, it is all sizzle and no steak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582115">There were many organizations that would have been capable of doing that work and developing that program really well, and there are tons of ugly details that I can get into, such as the unethical relationships and the extremely poor judgment that we saw from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, but I do not want to talk about that; I want to talk about students, because, like so many Canadians, I am weary of hearing about scandal after scandal by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582116">What I think has been lost in this discussion is that there was almost a billion dollars promised to help students, and it went missing. Nobody knows where that money went. In Alberta, there have been massive cuts to post-secondary education. Students and recent graduates are really suffering in my province and across the country. The Liberal government promised to relieve student loan debt; it has not done that yet. The Liberals agreed to my unanimous consent motion to halt repayments on student loans until after the pandemic, but again they acted in bad faith and have not done that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582117">We need to find out why they wanted this money to go to WE charity, because it is in fact a really bad organization to give money to, but we also need to know what we are going to do to protect students and how students ended up having to bear the brunt of these bad decisions by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582118">Now I am going to talk a bit about what happened with sexual misconduct issues in the Canadian Armed Forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582119">As the NDP deputy critic for women, gender and equality, I am shocked at the allegations of sexual misconduct in the military. I have dedicated my life to international development, sustainable development and human rights, with a particular focus on the rights of women and girls in Canada and around the world, so I am deeply troubled by these allegations and the continued failure to protect women and to have a reporting mechanism in place that will protect victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582120">For women to be able to serve equally in the armed forces, they have to have confidence that complaints will be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly, no matter who is the perpetrator. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew about sexual misconduct allegations against the chief of the defence staff, General Vance, in 2018, yet they decided to leave him at the very top of the chain of command for more than three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582121">I have to tell members that I had a phone call last week. One of the victims actually phoned my office and wanted to talk to me about what she had experienced. She felt revictimized. She felt scared of reprisal. She felt that the country that she had devoted her life to was not protecting her safety. It was a very difficult conversation for me to hear. For the government to say that we do not have the right to get the information to get to the bottom of this and to fix the problems within our military for women like the young woman who phoned me is an insult. It is an absolute insult. It insults women and it insults students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582122">The Liberals have tried many times here in the House and in many committees, and not just in the foreign affairs committee, to obfuscate and filibuster. They have worked to lead a conversation about what needs to be covered. They make excuses, they blame the Conservatives, they blame the provinces, they blame the processes in place, but they have the power to make those changes. They still have not come to terms with the fact that they have the ability to make those changes—</ParaText>

I was the executive director of an organization and would feel it was my responsibility to speak on behalf of that organization, but I also had staff who were experts in particular areas and they would be the best people to ask. That is what I am saying. When we cannot get answers from the government, when it does not answer our questions in good faith, what are we meant to do as opposition?

              <ParaText id="6582136">When the Conservatives were in power, their schtick was conducting everything in camera. Everything had to go in camera. The idea that we could have a public committee was outrageous. Everything had to go in camera.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582137">On the other hand, if the Liberals do not like a question, they filibuster. We have a government actually obstructing its own committees, then the Liberals act like the whiniest picked-upon people. They have a new thing now: there is somehow a tyranny of the majority picking on the minority. The minority here is the Government of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582138">The Liberals have been filibustering about the fact that the Liberal government is trying to stop accessing vaccines in the third world. They have been filibustering on that. They have been filibustering the very serious issue of sexual misconduct and the failure of the defence department to defend women in the military. Rather than get answers, they are filibustering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582139">Of course, they have filibustered in the ethics committee day in and day out for so long that, in terms of what is happening at the ethics committee, I think we know pretty much all that we are going to know about the WE group. We know that after eight months, we can honestly and confidently say we do not have a clue how this financial operation runs. This is such an obscure, massive system of all their real estate holdings, their private companies, their supposed public entities, their charities and their holding companies that we still have not been able, after eight months, to get answers. That is very serious. In fact, we just had a letter from their lawyer who is outraged that we are asking how many schools they actually built.

A ridiculous amount of time and House resources were wasted when the Liberals filibustered. That is unacceptable. Making so many people work for nothing is a waste of time. Why are we being kept in the dark? What is so dangerous about all of this that the Liberals want to cover it up?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582203">In a healthy democracy, governments need to be very transparent. This is 2021. Canadians have a right to know what is going on in Ottawa. They have a right to know what the government wants to do with their tax dollars. Why is so much being kept from us? Perhaps the Liberals are looking out for their close friends or are trying to protect certain people, but from what? What did these people do, give or get, and in return for what?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582204">We simply want to get to the bottom of these events. If there is nothing to hide, the witnesses and the Prime Minister just have to show up and tell Canadians the truth. Then we can move on. However, the Liberals are dead set on hiding certain shocking actions that could hurt the government if Canadians were to learn about them before an election is called. I think that Canadians have the right to know what they are dealing with. They have the right to know everything before they cast their vote. They want to be confident in their vote for the person who will be representing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582205">Unfortunately, this government is desperate to hide its close ties with friends who do favours for them. We do not understand what is going on, so we want to find out. In conclusion, the committees have to be able to do their job, and the filibustering must end. The time we are wasting is costing Canadians a lot of money. There is nothing to be gained by making us waste our time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582220"> Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise in the House and represent the people of Red Deer—Lacombe. I am proud to stand in my place, holding a Liberal government to account, using one of the precious few opposition day motions we have to try to force the Liberals to live up to even the minimal ethical standards Canadians expect from their government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582221">Today's motion is seeking answers. It is seeking to support and empower members of Parliament in their important work and to end the Liberals' coordinated cover-ups at the defence and ethics committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582222"> It is deeply disturbing that the Liberal MPs on the committees are continuing to block key witnesses from testifying on both the government's WE scandal and the Liberal cover-up of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces. How did we get here? In both cases, the short answer is that we got here because of Liberal cover-ups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582223">As members and most Canadians will remember, the WE Charity scandal came about when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the then finance minister Bill Morneau gave a sole-sourced contract to run the Canada student service grant. The program announced was worth upward of $1 billion, including over $45 million in fees to WE Charity, an organization with close ties to both the Prime Minister and the Morneau family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582224">These ties were so close, in fact, that WE received at least $100,000 in recent donations from Mr. Morneau and his wife. The charity also employed Mr. Morneau's daughter. As for the Prime Minister, WE Charity had paid his family members hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees. Since the Kielburgers' recent testimony at the ethics committee, it is not clear what that exact figure is, but it could be as high as $566,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582225">Recent evidence from the ethics committee has raised additional contradictions to the Liberal government's claims that the public service recommended WE Charity to run the program. Craig Kielburger wrote to Ben Chin, a senior adviser in the Prime Minister's Office, saying, “Hello Ben, Thank you for your kindness in helping shape our latest program with the gov't. Warmly, Craig”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582226">This interaction appears to be in complete contradiction to the Liberal government's talking points, reigniting the concerns of corruption this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> previously attempted to quash when he prorogued Parliament. Kielburger's explanation that Mr. Chin had no role and that this was a personalized message sent from a staff member is simply bizarre. It simply does not make sense, and it deserves further scrutiny. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582227">On a matter as important as this, we need the truth. That is why we are asking two senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office and one from the finance minister's office to appear at the ethics committee, so they can explain their interactions with the Kielburgers in respect to the selection of WE Charity to run the Canada student service grant program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582228">The second cover-up is equally as disturbing and involves the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>'s failure to address allegations of sexual misconduct at the highest levels in the Canadian Armed Forces. When the former military ombudsman brought an allegation forward to the minister regarding then chief of the defence staff General Vance, the minister refused to even look at it. Instead, he attempted to pass the buck on to the civil servants in the Privy Council Office. He did not follow up. He did not ensure that the complaint was handled appropriately, and he certainly did not ensure that this matter was treated with the seriousness that it ought to have been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582229">The minister abdicated his responsibility, and in doing so, he failed the people, particularly the women, serving in the Canadian Armed Forces who came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. He has tried to claim he was avoiding political interference. The reality is that it appears he was trying to avoid doing his job because it was going to be difficult, uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing to the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582230">While the minister was not willing to investigate or ensure an investigation took place, or to even make sure that the right mechanisms existed for investigating the man at the very top of the Canadian Armed Forces command structure, he was still able to give him a pay raise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582231">Throughout this whole ordeal, we have seen shifting narratives of who knew what and when, and of what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew and when he knew it. Canadians deserve the truth. Serving members of the armed forces deserve the truth. Women serving in the armed forces need the truth. Since the Liberals seem all too happy to coordinate a shameful cover-up, we are left with few options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582232">In some ways, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have slowed time down to a crawl. While November 2015 may seem like ages ago at this point, Canadians have not forgotten the commitments made to them back then by the government. This <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was the one who promised sunny ways and transparency. He promised to be open by default.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582233">Back in November 2015, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wrote a message to his ministers as part of his document “Open and Accountable Government”. Do members remember this document? It was made up of lovely words, but they were extraordinarily short-lived in the current Liberal government. Today's motion is essential because of the government's complete abdication of its responsibility to the principles outlined in that very document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582234">I could easily go back and talk about cash for access, billionaire island or SNC-Lavalin to make my point, but the current Liberal government has such a poor track record when it comes to ethical behaviour, I do not really have to go back that far at all. Just in considering the WE scandal and the Liberals' cover-up of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces, which are the two topics that this motion is dealing with, we can demonstrate that the Liberals have gone back on virtually every notion contained in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s flagship message in “Open and Accountable Government”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582235">This is not an exaggeration. If the House will indulge me, I would like to refresh for Canadians the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s words in that document, “To be worthy of Canadians’ trust, we must always act with integrity. This is not merely a matter of adopting the right rules, or of ensuring technical compliance with those rules.” By refusing to look at evidence of sexual misconduct against the then chief of the defence staff presented by the then military ombudsman, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> did not act with integrity. Refusing to speak with the ombudsman again afterward is not acting with integrity. Turning his back on members of the Canadian Armed Forces who want accountability for sexual misconduct is not acting with integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582236">The next part reads, “As Ministers, you and your staff must uphold the highest standards of honesty and impartiality, and both the performance of your official duties and the arrangement of your private affairs should bear the closest public scrutiny.” When it comes to the WE Charity scandal, honesty and impartiality are less achievable than a balanced budget for the government, as demonstrated by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s and former finance minister Bill Morneau's ability to arrange their private affairs, which they have both admitted when they acknowledged they should have recused themselves from the selection process for the Canada student service grant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582237">The document continues, “This is an obligation that is not fully discharged by simply acting within the law.” Even if acting within the law was the high bar, the government would have tripped over its own shoelaces two steps in. For those who do not believe me, let us count the number of ethics laws the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has already broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582238">The document goes on, “The trust of Canadians will also rest on the accountability of our government. In our system, the highest manifestation of democratic accountability is the forum of Parliament. You are accountable to Parliament for the exercise of the powers, duties and functions with which you have been entrusted.” In response to the WE Charity scandal, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament in the middle of a pandemic to ensure that the full extent of his misdeeds did not come to light. When Parliament resumed, we saw countless hours of filibustering to avoid the truth and the Prime Minister even threatened an election during the pandemic just because members of Parliament wanted to create a committee to investigate the WE scandal, all to avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582239">The document goes on to state, “This requires you to be present in Parliament to answer honestly and accurately about your areas of responsibility...” When it comes to both the WE scandal and the defence minister's failures to address sexual misconduct, we have seen countless revisions to the stories about who knew what and when. Honesty and accuracy have been replaced by deception, deceit, duplicity and the distortion of so-called facts, so much so that they bear little to no resemblance to the truth at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582240">It continues, “to take corrective action as appropriate to address problems that may arise in your portfolios, to correct any inadvertent errors in answering to Parliament at the earliest opportunity...” Corrective action has been in short supply. Instead, the government has continued to double down on mistakes by trying to cast the blame on others, like the former military ombudsman, or civil servants at ESDC or the Privy Council Office. The only problem that the Liberals seem to try to actually address is their problem of parliamentary accountability and the pesky opposition members who continually demand the truth from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582241"> Instead of working to live up to the high standards they claim to have for themselves, they coordinate filibusters across numerous committees, while repeating clunky talking points in the House of Commons that, at best, dance around the question or do not even relate to the topic at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582242">The excerpt ends with the following, “and to work with parliamentary colleagues of all political persuasions in a respectful and constructive manner.” This is where we can hold out a little hope. So far, we have seen very little constructive and respectful engagement from the Liberal government. The Liberals prefer to use procedural manoeuvres to keep Canadians in the dark, refusing to allow the sunshine that they once touted as the best disinfectant to shine in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582243"> However, this is the Liberals' opportunity to change. This is the opportunity to demonstrate that they believe what they said five years ago, that it was not just virtue signalling put forward at the beginning of their mandate, that it was actually something that they continue to aspire to even when it is inconvenient. I guess we will see how the vote goes.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6582264">Madam Speaker, I asked a question intentionally, because the Conservative Party, as an opposition party, has many days in which it gets to set the agenda of the House of Commons. This is its second time this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582265">I would like to emphasize, as I did in the question, that the Conservative Party of Canada is more focused on personal attacks and looking under every little rock as much as possible to try to create a negative image toward politicians in general, with a special focus on ministers of the Government of Canada. The Conservatives have an opportunity to debate something I think Canadians would welcome. For example, this past weekend, the Conservative Party of Canada and its membership failed to pass a motion to declare that climate change was real. They failed to recognize that most Canadians recognize that climate change is real, but not the Conservative Party of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582266">The Conservatives had a golden opportunity in an opposition day motion to be more relevant to what Canadians from coast to coast to coast have an interest in. As opposed to trying to further their beliefs based on their membership, they have chosen once again to focus on character assassinations and trying to be as disruptive to the Parliament of Canada as they can be. They are not happy with what is going on in the committees, because Liberal members of Parliament are there during the day, afternoons and evenings, ensuring that there is a higher sense of ministerial accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582267">I saw some of the behaviour of opposition members during the summer and the character assassination that was taking place. They should be ashamed of some of the actions and some of the questions they were putting to us. Then they get upset when the Liberal Party members say just wait a minute. We disagree with the direction in which the Conservatives want to take standing committees. We will stand up for ministerial accountability, but I think Canadians would be upset with the irresponsible behaviour we have seen from opposition members on the floor of the House of Commons and in committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582268">The Conservatives are critical because Liberal MPs are filibustering. Conservative, NDP and Bloc members of Parliament have all filibustered at different points in time. It is an unholy alliance. I do not know how the Conservatives conned the New Democrats and the Bloc to come onboard with them in what they are trying to accomplish today. They are joining the Conservatives in filibustering this Parliament. Shame on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582269">They do not recognize what the Conservatives are really up to. This has nothing to do with championing women's rights. Conservative members have asked whether the government has any credibility on this issue. Of course, the Government of Canada has credibility on this. One only needs to look at things like the appointment of cabinet ministers shortly after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office and the many actions our leader has taken to reinforce how important it is that we champion women's rights. All members of the House of Commons should be champions for women's rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582270">It is a tyranny of the majority to walk over the rights of the minority. That is in fact what we are witnessing. After all, the opposition parties combined can pass whatever they want in the House. They do not like what is happening in the committee, so now they are trying to take control of the committees by passing motions on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582271">Imagine the outrage if the government attempted to do that in a majority situation and tried to take control of the standing committees. Then we would have the current unholy alliance bellowing from all the balconies how terrible it is that the government is using the floor of the House of Commons to force the committees to do what the House of Commons wants them to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582272">It is a tyranny that we are seeing from the opposition parties not recognizing the important role that standing committees play. I get agitated, because I believe what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been saying for months from day one, namely, that we need to be focused on helping Canadians. That is something this government has been focused on since day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582273">I must thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="253073" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>, and I know that his mother in Windsor, Marta, and his constituents would be very proud. They would be very proud of this member of Parliament, because as the Conservatives are so focused on looking under those rocks, we are actually doing work. This particular member is developing, promoting and encouraging the summer youth program. We understand how youth have been affected by the coronavirus and we are going to see an expansion of the youth program, because, as the parliamentary secretary who is responsible for it recognizes, that as much as the opposition party wants to play their destructive force, we still need to do a lot of good work. We will continue to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582274">I cite the parliamentary secretary as an example, because it was just yesterday or the other day this week that I heard a presentation by him and sensed the excitement about a program that will help young people from coast to coast to coast, whether as a result of the efforts of the parliamentary secretary, his minister, the government as a whole, or the strong leadership we have seen from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, mandating that Liberal members remain focused on helping Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582275">Every so often I hear from opposition members that it is the Liberals who are filibustering and that it is causing all sorts of issues that make them feel uncomfortable. Do members know how many hours I have sat in committee hearing New Democrats filibuster? It is more than I have heard from Conservatives. I did not like it, but I never moved a motion on the floor of the House of Commons to try to prevent an opposition member, or a member who is not in the majority, from being able to communicate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582276">Let there be no doubt that if this motion passes, we would be saying to standing committees that it does not matter what takes place at committee, because we will be telling them what they should be doing. Where are those great defenders of our standing committees among the opposition?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582277">I believe that the opposition collectively is more concerned about things like elections. I have heard them talk about elections. I do not hear the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or Liberal members talking about elections. I do hear the opposition parties talking about elections. I hear them constantly working together. I witness and see them working together to see how they can try to talk more about scandals than about the coronavirus. It was a different story 12 months ago, when we saw a much greater sense of co-operation and a much greater sense of wanting to remain focused. That does not mean that we cannot be critical of government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582278"> Look at the thousands of questions that were asked back in June and July by the opposition. How many of them were about on the vaccine? If my memory serves me correctly, back in June and July, zero or not such questions were asked. How many questions were asked about WE? There were hundreds if not maybe even thousands. I do not know. I do not have the research capabilities to find out those numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582279">At the end of the day it is about priorities. More and more, we hear the collective opposition as being more concerned about frustrating the government and what it needs to do to be there for Canadians than about taking care of the interests of Canadians. I say shame on the Conservative, Bloc and NDP members for not recognizing what they should be doing. The government House leader himself said if they want to have ministers come before the committees to provide that sense of accountability, we are prepared to do that. It was good enough for Steven Harper when he was the prime minister of Canada, but it is not good enough here. There is so much more that we could be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582280">It is truly amazing that when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put out the challenge of taking a team Canada approach to combatting the coronavirus, we were quick to give a lot of thanks to people who came to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582281">The other day I was talking to my daughter, Cindy, the MLA for Tyndall Park, about Manitoba's personal care homes, supportive housing and assisted living residences. Think in terms of the nurses, health care workers, providers, custodians, managers and volunteers. They were doing absolutely critical work, working with hundreds, if not thousands, of people who needed them there. They provided a critical service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582282"> I know I speak on behalf of all members, from the Prime Minister down and from my daughter, when I give our thanks for their being there. We recognize how important their role was through this last 12 months, but we are not through with the coronavirus. That third wave is very real. It is tangible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582283">One of the members who spoke before me said they wanted the committee to do this, that they would like to have more on that and more on this. I too would like to see committees debating different types of issues and maybe try to refocus on them, if I could. I hope to be on PROC. I would like to be able to share my thoughts with PROC, hopefully later this evening. I can tell my colleagues that these standing committees play a critical role in Parliament. One only has to look at some of the principles that we have established. Here I refer members to page 30 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, which states:</ParaText>

              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582286">As opposed to debating important government legislation, the Conservatives do not mind tying up committees. They do not mind bringing committee issues to the floor of the House to try to stir the pot to fit their agenda. Do they really want to talk about issues like climate change? I do not think they do. Unfortunately, the House leadership of the Bloc and the NDP seem to concur at times with the official opposition. Maybe I am wrong, but wait and see what happens with this vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582287">To try to give the impression that motions of this nature do not have any ramifications for what is taking place in Parliament is irresponsible. I believe that standing committees could be doing a whole lot more to protect the interests of Canadians from coast to coast to coast if they could get down to business and start to do what our Standing Orders actually say they could and should be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582288">I listened to the New Democrat member for <Affiliation DbId="252961" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> when she was talking about the WE issue. It has been discussed quite a bit. The opposition has declared the WE volunteer organization to be a real mess, a terrible organization. I understand it. They are official about that, but do my colleagues know that the Province of Manitoba also has contracts with WE, not only once but at least twice? I say that to my colleagues from Manitoba. Maybe they should be talking to Brian Pallister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582289">What about the Province of Saskatchewan? It too has contracts with WE. Are they talking to the premier in Saskatchewan? I do not know about the rest of the provinces. I have not made any other enquiries in regard to them. Are they giving them a heads up of all their so-called inside information that disqualifies them? It is not my responsibility to defend WE. It is interesting that Conservative and NDP members try to give a false impression. If it were up to them, they would like to say that it was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said “yes” and that he wanted WE to have this contract. That is false, balderdash, a bunch of garbage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582290">All opposition members know that it was a civil servant who made that recommendation to government. What does that say about the civil servants? Do members have confidence in the civil servants? I wonder to what degree members of the opposition are being straightforward on that issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582291">The mover of the motion and other Conservatives kind of tipped their hat a little. They say that the motion is about these two issues, yet on the other hand, they talk about all sorts of ethical breaches. Imagine if we had the same set-up we have today, with an ethics commissioner, in the eighties during the Mulroney years, or even before then.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6582347">Madam Speaker, let us start, of course, at the beginning. In the beginning, this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> created a program that already existed. That program is called the Canada summer jobs program, and it is a program that lets young people work for charities, small businesses and other organizations that serve the community. The federal government simply reimburses a share of the wages paid to that student employee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582348">Now, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was suddenly hit by a lightning bolt that caused him to think it was necessary to contract out the very same program that had been functioning for so many years, and with such great success, to a group that just happened to have paid his family half a million dollars in speaking fees and expenses. He told us that there was no other way this could have been done. He told us that a bureaucrat in the employment department, the very department that has been running the successful in-house program for decades, concocted this scheme to give the money to this particular organization called WE.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582349">The entire government's defence, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252945" Type="2">Langley—Aldergrove</Affiliation> will be saying, as I am splitting my time with him, is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had nothing to do with any of it. The defence is that a mid-level bureaucrat rammed it all down his throat, and he was suddenly hit with a surprise attack at a cabinet meeting, when he apparently pushed back and said, “Hell no, I'm not giving all this money to my friends. Come back to me in a week and I'll reconsider.” That is the basis of his defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582350">There is only one problem with this defence and that is the documents. Let us start with correspondence between the WE organization and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own senior adviser, Ben Chin. Craig Kielburger, the founder of WE, sent Ben a message about the program. The message read, “Hello Ben, Thank you for your kindness in helping shape our latest program with the gov't. Warmly, Craig.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582351">We would think that if Ben actually had no role, and that it was in fact a mid-level employment department bureaucrat who did it all, he would write back and say, “Craig, thanks for the message, but you're being far too kind. I had nothing to do with setting up that program. It was designed by an employment department bureaucrat, with no involvement from the PMO. I wish you well in all of your future endeavours.” However, he did not write that. Instead, he wrote, “Great to hear from you Craig. Let's get our young working!” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582352">In other words, he was not for a moment suggesting that the message he got from Craig Kielburger was wrong, but rather, he was validating that it was, in fact, right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582353">If Mr. Chin has nothing to hide and if he played no role in setting up this program, then surely he will have no difficulty coming, as this motion from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> has proposed, and testifying under oath to explain his lack of involvement in establishing that very program. He would have to be careful because he would be followed by Rick Theis, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s director of policy and cabinet affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582354">Mr. Theis is the man who puts things in front of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> at cabinet, so he would know if the Prime Minister really did push back on this half-billion-dollar grant to the group that paid off his family. If so, he would be able to answer very specific questions before a parliamentary committee, putting the whole thing to rest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582355">That is exactly what we are proposing in this motion. We are proposing that Mr. Theis come to explain who really set up this program and whether the Prime Minister really did push back on paying off this group that had done so much for his family.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582356">What we find instead when we look at Mr. Theis's correspondence with the Kielburgers is that Mr. Theis was actually quite involved in the early stages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582357">I have a quote directly from correspondence from Craig Kielburger to this senior prime ministerial adviser, “Please find attached an updated version of the project plan and budget.... We appreciate your assistance both on timelines for a decision, and, if relevant, potentially assisting with streamlining the contribution agreement.... [W]e would appreciate a list of names with whom to discuss the youth entrepreneurship program to ensure that it's...[ready] for phase-2 recovery...[plans].”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582358">In other words, the contribution agreement, which again we were told was not the purview of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office but was being handled by a mid-level bureaucrat far away on the other side of the Ottawa River, was in fact being discussed between Mr. Kielburger and Mr. Rick Theis, the top adviser to the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582359">In fact, we have correspondence from Sofia Marquez, a lobbyist for the WE organization. She wrote, “Hi, Rick, Just wanted to let you know that I and, our co-founders Craig and Marc Kielburger are on the line waiting for you. Thank you! Sofia”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582360">To Ms. Marquez, Mr. Theis responded, “Sorry! Joined!” Then began the telephone conversation between the Kielburgers and this second to the top prime ministerial adviser.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582361">We are now getting to a summary of the program. It says here that Rick Theis spoke to Craig Kielburger, Marc Kielburger and Sofia Marquez, and according to Mr. Theis, the call lasted for approximately 25 minutes, so it was a substantive conversation. The summary states, “WE Charity raised their ongoing work with ESDC on the [Canada student service grant]”. That is the employment department and the half-billion-dollar grant. It continues, “as outlined in the attached document, and a proposal for a social entrepreneurship. Mr. Theis asked WE how what they are proposing for the [student service grant] would ensure diversity of placements. The Kielburgers expressed concern that this type of program would need to get off the ground soon. At no point were expenses discussed, nor any commitment, assurances or advice given by Mr. Theis to WE on any subject, other than to contact the ESDC.” That is Mr. Theis's claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582362">It took 25 minutes for Mr. Theis to tell them not to ask him, but to ask ESDC because he has nothing to do with this. How long does it take to say to call someone else because they have the wrong number? They spoke for 25 minutes on May 5, during which time, as is documented here, the Kielburgers were in a rush to get the money flowing. Do members know what happened? On May 5, their expenses became eligible for taxpayer reimbursement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582363">It was a total coincidence that this 25-minute conversation was about nothing. They would have us believe that this is a <I>Seinfeld</I> conversation. It was a 25-minute conversation about nothing, except that the Kielburgers asked if they could please hurry up because they wanted to get busy spending all that money promised. What do we know, on that very same day those expenditures became eligible for taxpayer reimbursement. This is a top adviser to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who had nothing whatsoever to do with setting up this whole affair. It is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582364">These two gentlemen in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office would have seen the promotional material that WE circulated in the PMO. Do members know who was in that promotional material? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s mother and wife. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582365">By the way, everyone in the PMO, the boss's wife and mother get money from WE. Maybe take that into account when deciding whether to give them some money. I am sure that Mr. Theis was so nice because he knew that the boss's wife and mother were getting paid by the organization with which he was having that 25-minute <I>Seinfeld</I> conversation about nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582366">The Liberal government might think a half-billion dollars is nothing. To the working people, to the people who are bagging groceries and serving on the front lines paying taxes throughout this pandemic, half a billion dollars is not nothing. They do not get speaking fees from powerful organizations like WE. They work hard every day for their money, and they deserve answers on what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did with that money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582367">If the government has nothing to fear, if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has any courage, he will support this motion and let us get to the answers.</ParaText>

I also want to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> and Conservative shadow minister for ethics, for moving this motion. I appreciate the opportunity to represent my community of Kelowna—Lake Country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582387">The motion states very aptly in its first sentence, it is “to support the authority of committees in their important inquiries of public interest”. It should be no surprise that I believe committees do some of the most important work in the House of Commons when it comes to studies and getting answers. I have spoken on the importance of committees several times in the House before. I expressed concerns when the Liberals shut down committees almost completely in the early stages of the pandemic in 2020, leaving a lot of gaps in the scrutiny of legislation, emerging issues and important studies that needed more review. Many committees barely sat for most of the year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582388">One of the other issues is how committees can hear from witnesses, and I have seen first-hand how important committee work can be. During much of 2020, I was on the industry, science and technology committee, which met until the Liberals shut it down due to the prorogation of Parliament. It had important studies and heard testimony on emerging issues such as from the largest grocery stores, Internet giants on contact tracing and censorship, tourism stakeholders and more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582389">I have said in the House before that the committee I sit on now, the Standing Committee on International Trade, only met once between April and September of 2020, losing time to do important work such as hearing from exporters and importers on how COVID-19 and its related restrictions had affected them, doing studies on domestic wineries having to pay excise tax due to a WTO challenge, and doing a pre-study on the Canada-U.K. trade agreement, which the committee finally began halfway through November 2020. This was only thanks to the Conservatives moving a motion, as there were deadlines that we knew had to be met in order to give certainty to businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582390">My colleagues on the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics are working to get answers on two very important issues that Canadians and my constituents are concerned about. Unfortunately, the Liberals have gone to great lengths to prevent MPs from getting answers and finding out the truth, including blocking key witnesses from appearing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582391">The ethics committee has been working to get answers on the WE Charity scandal and the $500-million contract offered to it to manage the proposed Canada student service grant. Let us not forget how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the then finance minister, Bill Morneau, failed to recuse themselves from cabinet discussions on this issue despite their personal ties to the charity. As Conservatives and other opposition parties tried to get answers, Liberals prorogued Parliament and filibustered committees to try to delay and cover up this issue for as long as they could. This put the governance of our country at a standstill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582392">Speaking of committees, let us remember that five months ago, in October 2020, the official opposition sought to pass a motion to establish a committee to look into the government's actions and further investigate exactly what transpired with the sole-sourced WE Charity contract. During this time, the government threatened to call an election over this and the motion did not pass. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582393">It is important to note that this was the first time in over 150 years of Canadian history that a prime minister turned a motion to create a committee into a confidence vote, where the government could fail. How incredibly desperate were the Liberals to not have their actions looked into? Canadians deserve an ethical government that is focused on their priorities. It was disappointing that this vote failed at the time, as it would have allowed parliamentary committees to get back to work for Canadians rather than be tied up by Liberal time-wasting filibusters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582394">Further to the importance of supporting the authority of committees in their important inquiries of public interest, as is outlined in this motion, at a recent defence committee meeting, testimony from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> showed he was aware of the allegations around sexual misconduct by the former chief of the defence staff. This was confirmed by the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation>, and the Prime Minister knew for three years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582395">At a recent ethics committee meeting, Craig and Marc Kielburger claimed that a senior adviser in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office, Ben Chin, had no role in setting up the $500-million Canada student service grant. However, documents released to the finance committee last summer proved that this was simply not the case.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582396">This is a serious contradiction, and Canadians deserve answers about what actually happened. Craig Kielburger said that the Prime Minister's Office had no role in setting up the grant, which would have given the WE Charity a half-billion-dollar program to administer, and that is taxpayer dollars. Then we heard that Mr. Chin had a written message about the PMO adviser's efforts to “shape our latest program”. The committee absolutely must hear from top Trudeau advisers. Canadians deserve the truth. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582401">Madam Speaker, a constituent in Kelowna—Lake Country wrote to me to say that “...the stonewalling and contempt for the intelligence of the electorate is staggering”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582402">We have seen their true character through the actions of the Liberals during this pandemic. Someone's true character often comes out during times of incredible stress. In times of crisis, we see heroes emerge who perform incredible acts of courage and physical strength, or beautiful gestures of care to help someone, or laser-focused leadership. What we saw from the Liberals during this time of crisis and stress was their true character: turning to the easiest of solutions and turning to Liberal friends. There was a lack of requests for proposals, giving sole-sourced contracts to known Liberal friends and not bothering with declarations of conflicts of interest. The Liberals and their friends will say, “Move on, there's nothing more to see here”, but every time a document is released or someone testifies, we gain new insights into the true character of how the Liberals govern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582403"> In the end, we know that accountability comes from the top. That means there has to be accountability from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his government and all who have been involved. It is also why this motion specifies that, should the Prime Minister instead appear before the committee mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) at any of the dates and times mentioned for at least three hours, the witnesses otherwise scheduled to appear, and any other witnesses scheduled to appear before the same committee at a later time, would be relieved of their obligation to appear pursuant to the order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582404">The other part of this important motion is regarding the national defence committee and getting answers there. I want to thank my colleagues on the national defence committee, including our shadow minister for defence and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252522" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation>, for holding the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> to account and getting answers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582405">We learned, through defence committee testimony, that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was aware of the allegations around sexual misconduct by the former chief of the defence staff. This was confirmed by the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation>, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew for three years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582406">Tens of thousands of women have served, and continue to serve, Canada honourably and without compromise in our military, but the government has failed to ensure that women have a safe environment, free from abuse or harassment by superiors and colleagues, to do this important work. We must ensure that this is corrected. We need to hear from those involved, including the Minister of National Defence's former chief of staff, on what transpired in the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s office and why actions were not taken earlier, promptly, to get answers when the allegations first became known to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582407">This government often likes to portray itself as a feminist government, yet it spent years without taking action and thoroughly investigating the sexual misconduct allegations the defence committee is finally looking into now. This is unacceptable. What message does this send to any woman who currently serves, or may in the future serve, our country in the military?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582408">In summary, committees need all the tools available to them to do their work and to get answers for Canadians. We need to hear from these senior members of the government to ensure that the record reflects what has occurred, whether with the WE Charity scandal or with the allegations against the former chief of the defence staff. This motion would ensure that there would be accountability from the government, it would ensure that those who make decisions are accountable to parliamentarians and it would ensure that committees could continue to do their jobs: scrutinizing government decisions and finding answers we would normally not get out of question period or debate here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582415">Madam Speaker, in opposition, the Liberals always tried to bring political staffers to committee. Now they are making this argument that we should not call staffers. It is ministerial responsibility. However, we have done something completely different in this motion. We have given the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> the opportunity to be accountable. The Prime Minister has the opportunity, if he believes in this principle of ministerial accountability, to appear in place of his staffers at the committee and answer questions for them. We have done something that Liberals did not do in opposition, which is to give the government that alternative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582416">The government has spoken about filibusters, and Conservatives use the filibuster tool from time to time. We have done it to prevent the government from trying to unilaterally change the Standing Orders. I was part of a filibuster to prevent the government from trying to dramatically change the rules unilaterally and neuter the role of the opposition. It is a question of what we are filibustering for. When we have filibustered, we have been protecting the rules or prerogatives of Parliament. Liberals have been filibustering to prevent studies into their own corruption. If they are filibustering to prevent a study into their own corruption, I would say that is completely different from the necessary efforts that opposition parties have undertaken in the past, when the government has tried heavy-handedly to completely change the rules and neuter the important role that opposition has to play in the House. I wonder if my colleague has any comments on this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582422">I view this motion not necessarily to be the best use of the House's resources, and perhaps that is obvious, given the nature of the debate we have had so far. The principal reason is that it flies in the face of ministerial responsibility, which is a fundamental pillar of our Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Of course, I could regale the House with quotes of the former prime minister Stephen Harper, who confirmed this repeatedly at every opportunity, but the point has been made along those lines already.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582423">My sense is not just that it is an issue of ministerial responsibility. There have been exhaustive studies looking into some of the matters. I will speak specifically to some of my own experiences before the finance committee, which the ethics committee is now seeking to re-examine. Literally hundreds of hours at various committees have been dedicated to the study of the same issues. There have been thousands of pages of documents. Not only have there been political staff already testifying on these matters, but the opposition has demanded that public servants, who are non-partisan in nature, show up. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself showed up at the finance committee to testify in respect of certain matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582424">My experience during those committee appearances was that certain committee members of the opposition parties, primarily the Conservative party, were completely inappropriate during those hearings. I heard drive-by smears, not only of the political staff who did attend but of their families as well. I had to ask for an apology and on one occasion, I actually received one for the level of disrespect that was lobbied toward the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582425">Though I only have about one minute remaining, perhaps by way of introduction, I do think the motivation behind this motion is not truth seeking in its function. It seems to be a distraction, because the opposition members do not seem to have any ideas that they wish to put forward to consider. In the era of a global pandemic, they could be making suggestions on how we could foster a strong, inclusive and sustainable economic recovery. They could be pitching solutions to climate change or vaccine deployment. They could be making suggestions on how the government could improve its public health response to COVID-19. Instead, they want to demand that individual political staff come before parliamentary committees to testify about a matter that has been before several committees for a number of months.</ParaText>

One such organization is Penny Appeal Canada, a Muslim aid and development agency delivering aid both domestically and internationally. During Ramadan, throughout April and May, Penny Appeal Canada will be partnering with local restaurants in Ontario and Alberta to purchase 6000 meals which volunteers will deliver to families in need.

Coastal first nations and British Columbians need a government that will make historic investments in the conservation, protection and restoration of wild salmon habitats.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582731">In his intervention, he mentioned that, at present, the maximum number of members who can safely be physically present during sittings is 86 and should reflect the proportions of the recognized parties. He thus argued that the number of members from the government party should not be limited to one or two, particularly since ministers participate by video conference from their office on Parliament Hill and take part in activities in the building where the House is sitting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582732">He also acknowledged several times that the virtual House is the extension of the physical House. The member feels that the under-representation of members of the government party and cabinet physically present in the House is unacceptable and should be corrected to guarantee the application of the principle of ministerial responsibility and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582733">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252770" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation> supported the position expressed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252618" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582734">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> responded that this was not a point of order because, according to the rules governing the hybrid House, there is no difference between participating in the debates in person or remotely. He added that the choice to limit physical presence was done out of respect for the health and safety of members and employees of the House administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582735">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252618" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> is essentially asking the Chair to decide on two questions: whether a minimum number of members from the government party must be present in the House, and whether ministers participating remotely impairs the principle of ministerial responsibility. On January 25, 2021, the House adopted an order that allows members to participate in deliberations by video conference until June 23, 2021. Since it is up to the House to establish its own rules, it occasionally decides to amend its practices on an ad hoc basis or for specified periods of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582736">As a servant of the House, I am here not to judge the wisdom of its decisions, but to enforce the rules it establishes. A careful reading of the order that currently governs our work gives no indication that the role and functions of members who participate in deliberations by video conference differ from those who are physically present. In fact, there is a will to take the necessary measures to allow them to contribute fully by stipulating that those who participate remotely count for the purpose of quorum. Members can table documents and reports, present petitions and vote. I would add that there is no limit on their right to intervene under any heading of the Order of Business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582737">Thus, in the eyes of the Chair, there is no difference between a member who is participating in person and one who is participating by video conference with respect to attendance contributing to deliberations or quorum. For the same reason, there is no grounds to conclude that ministers participating by video conference impairs accountability or the principle of responsible government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582738"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="252618" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> mentioned that it was agreed to limit the number of members present in the House in order to follow public health guidelines and to allow members to participate in the deliberations of the House safely. However, at no point did the House specify in the order of January 25, 2021, a minimum number of members who must participate in person. In the absence of any indication to the contrary from the House, the choice of method of participation remains at the discretion of each member.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582743">Mr. Speaker, there are several problems I have with the motion on the floor. Some are problems of substance, and some are problems of process. Some relate to the fact that this motion is extraneous to the issues that really matter to Canadians, who are going through a once-in-a-lifetime public health and economic emergency that demands the full attention of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582744">I will begin with the problems of process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582745">The principle of ministerial responsibility is a golden thread that runs through Westminster parliamentary democracies around the world. The concept of confidence is something that our entire system is built upon. The House must maintain confidence in the government in order to have the government stand. Indeed, the government is made up of, in part, the executive, including cabinet ministers. Whether the opposition has confidence in the staff of those ministers is not relevant to who remains in government. Though it is essential that the House maintain confidence in itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582746">I have certain, serious reservations about calling the individual political staff of cabinet ministers before committees in the present circumstances, in part because it is not truly their responsibility but that of their employer, which in this case is the minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582747">However, some of my reservations are informed by experience. I am speaking about some of the matters that relate to the Canada student service grant having had an investigation. I have been on the finance committee. I know similar issues have been pursued before other committees, including the ethics committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582748">I was supportive of the idea to undertake a study and call certain ministers before that committee, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. However, what I saw during that experience was very little interest in truth-seeking and rather a great interest in creating a political circus, particularly when it came to the staff who did appear, including not just political staff, but non-partisan public servants as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582749">On one occasion, when the chief of staff of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> attended, I saw behaviour that was unbecoming of a parliamentary committee. I saw not only questions about the development of programming, but also drive-by smears on her family members. It was reprehensible to watch that kind of attack, not just on those of us who put our name on the ballot and expect this sort of public scrutiny, or on staff, but on the family members of staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582750">Moreover, I will point out that there has been no shortage of consideration of many of the issues that are being pursued. There was literally hundreds of hours before the ethics and finance committees. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself testified at the finance committee. The chief of staff testified as well before the finance committee. The <Affiliation DbId="253404" Type="4">Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth</Affiliation> testified before both the ethics and finance committees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582751">Both committees also had the benefit of the testimony of the Clerk of the Privy Council, who is the head of Canada's public service. A number of public servants attended, gave testimony and answered questions. There was a significant waiver of cabinet confidences, and to some degree solicitor and client privilege, in these instances. Thousands of pages were disclosed, giving all of the information that one could conceivably want to see regarding the development of that particular program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582752">I want to turn my attention not just to the problems of process, but to what I believe is the motivation for today's motion, which is that the official opposition seems bereft of ideas that actually matter to Canadians who are struggling to get through the COVID-19 pandemic. It looked at the jobs numbers that came out for the month of February, in which 259,000 Canadians obtained a job they did not have one month before, and there has not been a question about our job numbers in question period since. Now that the vaccine rollout has really hit its stride and we are seeing two million doses per week arriving within our borders, we are no longer seeing questions about vaccine administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582753"> The Conservative Party seems to be in a very difficult place. They try not to draw attention to the issues that matter around jobs and the economy. They try not to draw attention to the government's public health response when it seems to be going fairly well. They try desperately to avoid attention on some of the issues that are plaguing their internal politics. This includes the fact, which I might point out, given the Supreme Court of Canada's decision today affirming that climate change is real, which should not require any affirmation, 54% of their members recently voted at their partisan convention to deny a motion that included those very words.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582754">The reality I see is, we are dealing with a party that desperately wants to avoid drawing attention to the government's record because we have had a world-class economic response to this pandemic, and its members want to create a political sideshow. They want to bring individual staff members of ministers before a committee to see if they can get that gotcha moment for their social media accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582755">I do not think that is appropriate in our system. Instead, it would be far better if all parties in this House would focus on the issues their constituents are actually calling them about, things like whether the government is actually advancing the kinds of economic supports that will keep food on their tables and a roof over their heads, or whether local businesses are receiving the kinds of supports that will help them keep their doors open. Instead, they want to call individual political staffers before certain committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582756">Although some of the staff members did not sign up to have their name on the ballot and be scrutinized before parliamentary committees, some of the individual political staff I have worked with in the development of Canada's economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic are without doubt heroes. I think of the work they put in, staying up until one, two or three in the morning to email with MPs who had concerns or ideas to develop programs. That these programs are actually landing on the kitchen tables of families in my community today is nothing short of heroic. I want to take this opportunity to thank the political staff who have stepped up.</ParaText>

The deputy leader of the Conservative Party posted the telephone number of a private company on social media and encouraged Canadians to call and demand that the company break Canada's privacy laws and release information. This led to harassment and personal threats that left employees fearing for their personal safety and required the police to get involved.

              <ParaText id="6582810">We have heard the line that these are “unprecedented times” over and over again. While I do not disagree with that statement, it is beginning to sound like a broken record, in particular when the line is used to avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582811">Over the past 12 months, we have witnessed behaviour by the government that is incredibly inappropriate and, I would even say, exploitive. We could say that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has acted in a way that is truly unprecedented. I would say that a pandemic is not an excuse for unethical behaviour. The Liberals are doing their very best to block witnesses from testifying on both the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s WE scandal and the mishandling of sexual misconduct within the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582812">Today, before the House is a motion by Conservative members. It calls for critical witnesses to be brought forward to testify on these issues. Having served as the chair of the ethics committee, I will focus the majority of my time on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s WE scandal. However, I do believe that it is of utmost importance to comment briefly on the second part of this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582813">We know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> were made aware of sexual misconduct allegations against the former chief of the defence staff three years ago, and yet did nothing. Nothing at all. As part of the motion before the House today, we are calling for crucial witnesses to come to the national defence committee to testify. Up to this point, Liberal members on the committee have continued to block the appearances of key staff members whose testimony would provide answers on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the chief of the defence staff, General Vance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582814">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claims to be a feminist, but he continually fails to protect women. Canadians have placed trust in the government—great trust, I would argue. The reality is that if they are going to place that trust in the government, then they do deserve to know the truth. I cannot imagine what it must be like for a victim of sexual assault in the Canadian Armed Forces watching the ping-pong game of their story being made light of. It is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582815">For someone who claims to be such a staunch feminist, it is astounding how hard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government are fighting to cover up this sexual misconduct and the way it was handled. It has become clear that the Prime Minister would rather protect his own reputation than the brave women who have signed up to serve with their lives. It is sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582816">The second part of this motion calls for key witnesses to testify on the WE scandal. Last year, as part of the government's pandemic spending, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave his friends at the WE Charity a sole-sourced agreement for half a billion dollars. That is half a billion of taxpayer dollars. This same organization gave the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family roughly $500,000 in the time leading up to that agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582817">Something happened in June last year, which is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> got caught. As revelations began to surface about his involvement in this sole-sourced deal, Canadians were shocked and, as we can imagine, also frustrated and even outraged. Why was there no competitive bidding process put in place? Who was involved in making this deal happen? Why is it so hard to get to the bottom of this? What is preventing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government from being honest?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582818">As the pressure from opposition parties the media and the public increased, we can only assume that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office saw that shutting down Parliament was the only answer to stop the truth from coming out. In the middle of a pandemic when billions of dollars were going out the door, when plans needed to be made for economic recovery and when Canadians needed to see leadership the most, the Prime Minister decided to shut down this place. The Prime Minister decided to prorogue Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582819">As a result, all of the studies on the WE scandal went out the door, which was convenient, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was then no longer forced to answer important questions and no longer to be held accountable for his actions. He could tuck himself away in his cottage and pretend for a while that everything was going to be okay, that his scandal-riddled past would not catch up to him. After all, he had already been convicted of two other ethical breaches and now this was his third. If he got away with the first two, then why would he not get away with this one?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582820">The truth is that perhaps he still will get away with it, but it is incumbent upon those of us on this side of the House to hold the government to account, to ask the difficult questions and to request the information that Canadians deserve to have come to light. Canadians have placed great trust in the government, and it is incumbent on us to hold the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582821">Since September when Parliament resumed, we have been working hard to try to get to the bottom of this scandal. The Liberals have fought relentlessly to defend their leader. They have filibustered for hours at committee. For a government that brags so much about openness and transparency, I do not remember seeing one prior that was so secretive, so unaccountable and acted so unethically. After all, we are talking about the only <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that has ever been convicted of an ethics scandal—in fact, not just one, but two, and now is being investigated for a third time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582822">The motion before the House is necessary to uncover what is taking place and have the truth made known to Canadians. It is a result of hearing contradictory testimony from the Prime Minister's Office. The Liberal ministers and the Kielburger brothers who founded WE Charity and are good friends with the Prime Minister and others high up in the PMO. Conservatives are calling for key witnesses to come forward and to be able to give testimony. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582823">I should add that this is not a game. The Liberals would like to paint it as such. They like to accuse us of “playing petty politics”, but in what world is the pursuit of truth petty? Only in a Liberal world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582824">When the Kielburgers first appeared before the ethics committee, they testified that Ben Chin, a senior adviser in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> 's Office, had no role in setting up this program. However, documents that were released at the finance committee last summer show us otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582825">On June 27, 2020, a LinkedIn message was sent from Craig Kielburger to Ben Chin, which said: “Hello Ben, Thank you for your kindness in helping shape our latest program with the go'vt. Warmly, Craig.” Two days later, Ben Chin responded to Craig Kielburger with a message saying, “Great to hear from you Craig. Let's get our young working!”<Query /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582826">Given the contradictions at play, the fact that he-said, she-said does not line up, the ethics committee must hear from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s top advisers with regard to this scenario.</ParaText>

The documents she referred that were turned over last summer are more than 5,000 in total. It was so much information that the Conservative Party put it on a website and tried to crowdsource going through the information. There was so much information that Conservative MPs could not deal with it on their own. They put it out to the public to get the public's assistance with it. That is how much information has been turned over. More importantly, the quote of Mr. Chin that she and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> continually reference is information that was reported by CTV in June and CBC in August last year. </ParaText>

Ms. Astravas is the chief of staff to the Liberal minister of gun control. It is nasty business slandering an entire community, as the people of Quebec know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582856">It is obvious that the reason Zita Astravas is afraid to appear before the defence committee is that the truth will come out about how little respect the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has for women in Canada, in this case the women who serve their country in uniform as members of the Canadian Armed Forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582857">It is not as though Canadians have not seen the Prime Minister disrespect women before. The Prime Minister's groping incident, when he made unwanted advances by groping a female reporter while she was trying to do her job, should have been a red flag to the Liberal Party about how he treats women: the Kokanee grope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582858">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s decision to throw the only strong women in his party under the bus—women like the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">justice minister</Affiliation> during the SNC-Lavalin scandal, the former minister of health for standing up for her colleague, and former Ontario female MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes for showing a backbone—demonstrates a pattern of behaviour. Canada's self-called feminist Prime Minister talks a good game about supporting women, but when the chips are down, they are the first ones to take the blame for his own mistakes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582859">The toxicity on Parliament Hill for women, particularly women in his own party, stems from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself.

              <ParaText id="6582965">I will say that I have noticed today that New Democrats have been very careful in discussing the actual issue. I know that they do not want to put themselves in a position where they are contributing to attacking staff, which is what we are seeing from the official opposition. It makes perfect sense, but what this is going to come down to is whether they are going to vote in favour of this motion. I know they do not want to go after staff because they know it is not right. Everything they are talking about today is not about the actual motion. They are skating around it and trying to pick up on points, very important subjects, I might add, that I wish we were discussing as the opposition day motion instead of this.</ParaText>

A woman who was in the forces for 20 years lost her career because she made a complaint, and her son was assaulted on the base because she had made that complaint. She asked how women who are sexually assaulted in the military can bring forward complaints when we see that the complaints against General Vance have not been taken seriously. She wants to know who women are supposed to report to and if these complaints will be taken seriously, because her complaint was not taken seriously by the RCMP or by the military and she was reprimanded.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6582974">I do appreciate the opportunity to rise and speak to the motion put forward by my hon. colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation>. The purpose of the motion is to support the authority of committees in their important inquiries of public interest with instructions to the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics regarding questions of conflict of interest in relation to pandemic spending, and to the Standing Committee on National Defence addressing sexual misconduct issues in the Canadian Armed Forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582975">The member has been stalwart and unwavering in his pursuit of accountability and truth, despite the constant attempts from Liberal members to impede his efforts. When all is said and done, I am hopeful that my colleague will be able to count on support from every party in this House, especially the governing party, given that the Liberals have said many times that they are committed to being transparent. What better way to be transparent than to allow committees to do their work in calling on witnesses to appear and answer questions on the important matters before them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582976"> We have repeatedly heard the government claim it is committed to transparency, yet trying to get to the bottom of what has happened with the WE scandal has been like trying to see through a glass of mud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582977"> Over this past year, Canadians have dealt with loss and faced much uncertainty as our country locked down in an effort to stop the spread of COVID. Their lives have been upended, as they have struggled to comply with public health orders in order to do their part. In return, they have gotten a government that has grown exceedingly comfortable with being evasive and unaccountable when it comes to its actions and decision-making during this time. From border closures to PPE procurement, and from vaccine procurement to government support programs, Canadians have paid a high price for the government's failures. Every time the government introduced a program, it was obvious it was thrown together haphazardly, resulting in Parliament being recalled several times to address the shortcomings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582978">On this point, I want to be clear. Conservatives have always understood that financial aid had to be provided if businesses were being shuttered and Canadians were being told to stay home. However, even during a pandemic, parliamentarians have a job to do. We on this side of the House always sought ways to improve the various support programs that were being proposed in order to ensure they were effective and targeted, and that they enabled people to get back to work when it was safe to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582979">When opposition members raise the concerns of Canadians regarding issues with legislation or the process, our insistence on due process and parliamentary oversight is characterized as playing politics and using delay tactics to slow down legislation. However, I ask members, who is playing politics and using delay tactics? Take, for example, the government's proroguing Parliament at the end of last summer. Why did they prorogue during a summer recess to a date already set for the fall session to resume? Quite clearly, it was an attempt to either end or delay the inquiries being made and cover up the WE scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582980">Another example is when Parliament resumed last fall and we were put on a time crunch to extend benefits such as CERB. When issues were raised about the system the Liberals had implemented, Conservatives were accused of holding up vital legislation. It is no secret that throughout this pandemic there has been continuous mismanagement by the government. Now, we need to get to the bottom of this serious breach of trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582981">While Canadians are struggling to make ends meet, Liberals have been struggling to shovel hundreds of millions of dollars into their friends' pockets. While, thankfully, they were not ultimately successful, this is not something that can just be swept under the rug and forgotten about.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6582982">Canadians want answers. Canadians deserve answers. As I noted earlier, they have been hit hard by the pandemic, and this has been exacerbated not only by the ineptitude but also the unethical behaviour of the Liberal government. While the government has allowed the deficit to balloon during this pandemic, large deficits and unethical behaviour are not a product of it. The Liberals were running deficits prior to the pandemic. Their financial mismanagement has simply reached new heights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582983">While increased spending during the global pandemic is one thing, refusing to be transparent about how much they were spending, how they are spending it and why they are spending it in certain ways is quite another. Now, when the government is being confronted on a very clear conflict of interest that involves hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, it is conducting a coordinated cover-up campaign to block witnesses from testifying at all costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582984">As I stated earlier, it should be no surprise that we are here today discussing another possible ethics violation from the government. This is not a product of the pandemic, but rather an area where the government has some consistency. If colleagues recall prior to the pandemic, there was the whole debacle with SNC-Lavalin. Even further back was the Christmas vacation in the Bahamas that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took to the Aga Khan's private island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582985"> It would seem the government thought a global pandemic would provide great cover to continue with its financial management, clear disdain for Parliament and lack of respect for the use of Canadian tax dollars, which has now led to these scandals and our attempts to get at the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582986">We are here today because the Liberals have made repeated attempts to block critical witnesses from testifying at both the ethics and defence committees. It is obvious to anyone watching that these are the actions of a government that has something to hide, or maybe they simply believe they do not have to abide by the same rules as everyone else. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government must be reminded that Canadians' hard-earned dollars are collected to benefit Canadians, not the Liberals, Liberal insiders or their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582987">It is unacceptable that a government would so flippantly grant a contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars to an organization that had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Prime Minister and his family. We can add to that the government's efforts to cover-up the sexual misconduct allegations against the former chief of the defence staff, which they found out about in 2018. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582988">Conservatives must not and will not allow this unethical behaviour to go unchecked. That is why this motion from my hon. colleague is so important. It requires the testimony from multiple witnesses at the appropriate committees so that we may get to the bottom of these scandals and offer answers to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6582989">The contempt the government has for Parliament, its procedures and, by extension, Canadians, is on clear display. It would prefer to do everything behind closed doors, while proclaiming its transparency and, when questions are asked, to accuse the questioner of playing politics and not caring for Canadians. Conservatives will not allow the truth to remain hidden.</ParaText>

It is a motion that should never have had to come before this House. The fact that we, as opposition members, have been left with no other choice but to bring it forward is as important as the motion itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583006">The motion is to direct the government to provide the support committees require to carry out their important work, essentially to instruct the government to provide documents and political staff witnesses for the conflict of interest in lobbying in relation to the pandemic spending study and to instruct Zita Astravas, the former chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and director of issues management for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and the current chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, to appear at the national defence committee for its study on addressing sexual misconduct issues in the Canadian Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583007">Canadians could be forgiven if, after hearing this, they said, “That seems incredibly reasonable.

              <ParaText id="6583008"> That is why this is such an important motion: It is because this motion is not a root cause but a symptom of something much bigger, something that speaks to some of our fundamental assumptions around the system of government and the values we hold dear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583009">The defence committee is conducting a study on addressing sexual misconduct issues in our Canadian Armed Forces, including the serious allegations against General Vance, the highest-ranking member in the Canadian Armed Forces, the chief of the defence staff. At the heart of the matter is that it appears that the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation>, his staff—then Zita Astravas—officials in the Privy Council Office, officials in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s Office and possibly the Prime Minister himself knew of these serious allegations in March of 2018 and took no action for three years. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583017">A military stands to defend the values of the nation, but it must also embody them. If the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> does not hold the military accountable to those values, including the ability for all members to serve equally with honour, free from sexual assault and discrimination, then who will? If the House of Commons committees cannot do the work to hold cabinet ministers accountable, who else can?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583018">While this motion is about mandating that committees can hear from critical witnesses, it is about much more than that. It is about the fundamental values and foundations of our society. When it comes to ensuring conduct of the highest level in the Canadian Armed Forces, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> says it is not up to him, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said that it is not up to him. If it is not up to them, then who is responsible? If they will not act in the best interests of Canadians, who will? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583019">The ends cannot justify the means. Every act at every step must be honourable and carried out with integrity, or the end itself is compromised. Democracy is fragile and is only as strong as the trust and confidence that Canadians place in all of us, their elected officials. That trust is hard won and easily lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583020">I strongly urge all of my colleagues in the House to honour the trust that Canadians have placed in them by voting in favour of this motion to ensure that committees can hold the government to account, and in doing so deliver a better Canada for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583209">I would like to thank my hon. colleagues for agreeing to this important discussion. I am not sure when the last time, or if there was a first time, the House of Commons had a take-note debate on gender-based violence. My team and I have been looking for that, but this is historic. I want to thank the Liberal women's caucus for sounding the alarm, our House leader for listening to us and for taking us seriously, and every single party in the House for agreeing to have this important conversation at this very important time in our history and for women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583210">These conversations are important and our government will continue to create spaces for them. However, this cannot just be about words, but has to be followed by action. When I see my Conservative colleagues vote against transferring essential funds to support women and children escaping violence and abuse in Quebec tonight, I have to question their sincerity. I hope my Conservative colleagues will account for why they voted the way they did in the time they have tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583211">I would like to talk about the women we lost, our government's response during the pandemic, the illness that causes the violence against women in the first place and how parliamentarians can lead the cultural shift necessary to put an end to this shadow pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583212">Let me say the names of the seven women we lost in Quebec in just seven weeks. Elisapee Angma, 44 years old, was the loving mother of four children. Marly Edouard, 32 years old, was a Haitian Canadian well known in the Haitian music scene and a former manager, producer and radio host. Myriam Dallaire, 28, was the young mother of a precious one-year-old child. Sylvie Bisson, 60 years old, was Myriam Dallaire's mother. Nadège Jolicoeur, 40 years old, was the mother of five children. Rebekah Harry, 29 years old, was the mother of a nine-year-old son and was described as a good friend and family member who lived life strongly. Nancy Roy, 44 years old, was loved and cherished by those around her. These women were loved and they will be missed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583216">When the pandemic was first declared, we reached out to leaders across the country, and they all said the same thing: They warned us the rates of violence would go up. We asked what the Government of Canada should do and they said we should get funds as quickly as we could into the bank accounts of organizations that would be the last stop for women and children fleeing violence and abuse, and we did that. Through an innovative model that had never been done before, we were able, with our partners, provinces and territories, the women's Shelters Canada team, the Canadian Women's Foundation and a separate agreement with the Government of Quebec, to get got money into bank accounts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583217">Over a thousand organizations in this country have been able to keep their staff paid, their doors open and to get the PPE, cleaning supplies and the laptops necessary to provide this critical care. I thank these organizations for their care. Because of them, we managed to prevent many, many more tragedies. Close to a million women, children and non-binary Canadians have been able to find care and refuge through these organizations during the pandemic. On behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Government of Canada, I would like to thank these leaders. They are in every single one of our ridings, and we could not do this work without them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583218">The issue of gender-based violence is not new. For decades, feminists, survivors and their families have been advocating for change. The pandemic has magnified and intensified the reasons for the violence, and people are under pressure, but violence against women is unacceptable. It is a violation of their dignity and human rights, and it costs all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583219">Our government is working with provinces and territories to move forward on a national action plan on gender-based violence. Our partners at the YWCA, led by Maya Roy, and our partners with the Blueprint coalition, led by Women's Shelters Canada's Lise Martin, have been out there ensuring that the voices of survivors are fed into our national action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583220">Provinces and territories have agreed to move forward. We have spoken with over 1,500 stakeholders across the country, and over the past five years we have increased funding to frontline women's organizations more than any other government, and five times more than the previous government. We have opened up regional offices and have lifted the gag order that prevented too many feminist organizations from advocating for their clients and those they serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583221">Every step of the way, including with the economic development measures that our government is working on, we will continue to rely on strong feminists across this country. They know the way. They have brought us to this moment in time when parliamentarians are having this courageous conversation, and every step of the way we will continue to work with them until every woman and child in this country is safe and free to achieve her dreams and reach her full potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583222">I see that Madam Speaker has taken the Chair. I appreciate your leadership and advocacy in this chamber and in the women's caucus. You are a rock, and your feminism and advocacy strengthen the rest of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583223">We have not always been brave enough to call the reason for this violence what it is. We have not always been brave enough to name it, but toxic masculinity is creating less safety for women, and it is robbing men of their dignity too. There are 238 honourable men in the House, and I am calling on all men to join us to help fight this preventable crime from happening in the first place. We need them. For too long, women have carried the burdens of violence against them, their families and their bodies, but more and more we are seeing guys step up as allies, like my former parliamentary secretary, who has been incredible in his advocacy, and like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada, who shares power and space with other women and encourages us to lead and be strong in our advocacy for those who do not have a voice at the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583224">There is a reckoning happening, and this reckoning requires us as parliamentarians to ensure that we seize the moment that has been offered to us, unpleasantly so because of the pandemic, to put an end to this violence once and for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583225">Not too many days ago on a schoolyard not too far from where I live, an 11-year-old girl was kicked in the hips really hard by a boy because she had outperformed him on the sports field.

              <ParaText id="6583226">In another place, in another school not too far from here, a 14-year-old boy, when cornered in a difficult conversation, told another 14-year-old girl that she was too ugly to be raped and asked her why she was even debating with him the safety of women.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583231">We heard from women's shelters, women's organizations, those working with young men and those from iconic sports organizations, such as the CFL, on why we need to engage men and boys, women and girls, and people of all genders and gender identities in the fight against the scourge of intimate partner and other gender-based violence.

Ultimately, it will be up to them to tell us if we got it right. We will be receiving that report sometime in mid-April, and I look forward to including all members of the House in the development and implementation of the national action plan.

              <ParaText id="6583259">Madam Chair, gender-based violence is entirely preventable. If folks who are at risk of harming are under a lot of pressure, they can go for a walk, call a friend, talk to a spiritual leader they trust or reach out to a counsellor before they do something they might regret. This violence is preventable. Bystanders, neighbours or people who know that a friend is in trouble can do something about it. They can call the individual who they are afraid is at risk and ask if she needs help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583260">The Canadian Women's Foundation has come up with a signal for help. It is to address the lack of informal support systems in place. If anybody is experiencing danger and makes this signal on social media, on a FaceTime or Zoom call, we can call for help. Call the individual and ask closed-ended questions like, “Are you okay? Do you need me to call somebody? Do you need me to call the police?”, and check in on them regularly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583261">We have invested in frontline organizations. We will continue to be there for them. We all have to step up our efforts with greater funding, but we also need to address the cultural norms.

              <ParaText id="6583263">Madam Chair, during the pandemic, we saw a shadow pandemic, a significant increase in domestic violence. Over the past few weeks, the tragedies that occurred in Quebec have reminded us of the sad reality that many women face. Over the past seven weeks, we have lost seven women to family violence in Quebec. Last year, we lost one woman or girl to violence every two and a half days. There is a crisis in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583264">This evening we remember them and we undertake to do better for the women and girls of this country. Experts warned us that there would be an increase in violence. Their reasoning was very simple. After a natural catastrophe, the rate of domestic violence increases. Economic recessions also lead to an increase in domestic violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583265">A pandemic is an economic recession during a natural catastrophe. The situation is therefore very serious. Those who deal with victims of domestic violence warned us of the risks to women who are locked down with their aggressors.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6583266">Those who deal with victims of domestic violence warned of the risks for women who would be locked down with their aggressors and abusers. At the start of the pandemic the Canadian Women's Foundation developed a sign for help: a hand gesture that could be quietly used on Zoom or on FaceTime to indicate that a woman was in an abusive situation. Raising her hand with her palm to the camera, a woman traps her thumb in her palm under her four fingers. If people know anyone who may be in an abusive situation, they should make sure to reach out to see if they can help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583267">We have all heard the “seven times” statistic by now, but it is worth repeating. It can take survivors on average seven attempts to successfully leave an abusive relationship and when they do, recent evidence suggests that violence against former domestic partners is also increasing significantly during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6583268">We have all heard about the seven times statistic, but it bears repeating. On average, survivors will try to leave an abusive relationship seven times before they manage to leave for good. Unfortunately, statistics show that, when they succeed in leaving, the violence against them by their former partner increases.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6583269">The recession is going to be a terrifying legacy of the pandemic. We know from all available statistics that it has disproportionately affected women and especially women in part-time and service sector jobs. In other words, these are women whose financial situations are already precarious. Financial instability is one of the reasons most frequently given for staying with an abusive partner. That should cause all of us to realize that even when the pandemic is over and Canadians are safely vaccinated, the silent pandemic of domestic violence will have worsened and will continue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583270">Financial problems are often given as a reason for staying with a violent partner. Even when the pandemic is over and Canadians are vaccinated, the shadow pandemic of family violence will still remain. We all need to be aware of that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583271">The motion as it is currently worded makes reference to the national action plan on gender-based violence. It is a pledge that the government has made since being elected, and it is an important pledge, but it is one that has been continually put off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583272">The government has never presented its policy in response to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls report, in spite of the fact that many provinces have begun to take action. As an example, last year many provinces announced the end to the practice of birth alerts, a practice that disproportionately impacts indigenous women. However, the Liberal government has failed to act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583273">This week, the Conservatives asked the Liberals to table a specific plan to gradually and safely lift the COVID-19-related restrictions. These restrictions have had a serious impact on the mental health of Canadians. They have also led to an increase in domestic violence across the country. Unfortunately, the government denied our request.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6583274">As I have said many times, the mental health crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has been a pandemic of tears for so many families. That is why the Conservative opposition will introduce a Canada mental health action plan and boost funding partnerships with provinces for mental health care. We will provide incentives for employers to provide better mental wellness coverage for employees. It is important that we, as this House voted, create a nationwide three-digit suicide prevention hotline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583275">We will also introduce a plan to restore the million jobs lost in this pandemic in one year, and not stop there. Let us remember that so many of those jobs were held by women, who now find themselves unemployed, and as I noted earlier, it is much harder for a woman to flee domestic violence if she does not have a reliable income.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583277">At this point in my speech, I would like to thank people who have mentored me to be an advocate on this issue from the time of 2006 and 2007: the late Hon. Jim Flaherty and my father, John O'Toole, member of the provincial Parliament for Durham, who in 2007 introduced the Lori Dupont Act in memory of a nurse who was killed in the Hotel Dieu Grace Hospital in Windsor by a former partner. She was unable to secure a peace bond from someone who was a known aggressor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583278">I was proud to work with my father, as a lawyer at the time, on Bill 10, to provide an intervention order to avoid situations like the one Ms. Dupont found herself in, asking for help from the state, knowing there was a risk, and the workplace and the province were not able to act. As a parliamentarian today, I am proud to continue that tradition that was begun by my father.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583279">This evening, I want to remember the seven women in Quebec who recently lost their lives as a result of a femicide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583280">We also mourn the lives of the 160 women lost to feminicide this last year alone: 160 daughters, sisters, mothers, friends. Their lives had purpose and value, and we will cherish their memory. They were taken by people they had trusted or loved, snuffed out, and we cannot forget them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583281">As we mourn, let us recommit as Canadians to ending violence towards women and to watching for the signs of violence around us, whether online or in our workplaces. We all must recommit to do more. Important debates like this, after seven weeks of tragedy in Quebec, are one small step.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583327">As I mentioned in my speech on March 8, the pandemic has given women and girls quite a few slaps to the face. I am not just talking figuratively, with the increased mental burden, invisible work and frontline work in our health care system. I am especially referring to the literal sense of the word, because far too many women have been killed as a result of the marked increase in domestic violence cases. During the pandemic, 10% of women lived in fear of domestic violence. That number is three times higher among indigenous women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583328">This evening, I want to let the facts speak for themselves. Sadly, one in three women is a victim of domestic violence.

              <ParaText id="6583331">The point I am trying to make with this example is that it is important to include men in this conversation, in this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583332">Geneviève Guilbault, the Deputy Premier of Quebec and minister of public security stated the following in an interview:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583333">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> What has been happening this week is tragic. This is extremely upsetting, shocking and entirely unacceptable. We have a responsibility as a government and as a society to stop violence against women. This must be done through prevention and enforcement, but first and foremost through accountability. We must encourage men to seek help when they are violent or at risk of being violent, and obviously, of course, remind women that they can and must ask for help.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583334">It is unacceptable that weeks will go by before men will get any help to prevent domestic violence. The government also needs to make sure that it provides funding to prevention organizations, because the budget, at first administrative, will probably be adapted to include funding to address and prevent violence against women. We must condemn the problem, yes, but that will not solve everything. Society needs to repeat the message and continue to hammer the point home in order to change mindsets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583335">In addition to those seven femicides over six weeks in Quebec, last year alone, over 300 women were the victims of attempted murder, a chilling statistic. We need to continue to put pressure on the government, but we also must not forget that society as a whole needs to work together to resolve the problem of domestic violence. We need to acknowledge what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583336">I want to recognize the exercise that was recently carried out in Quebec, where a committee of experts studied violence against women. Beyond the roadmap, the federal government also needs to collaborate by quickly transferring substantial funding to the organizations. As a society, we also need to find the will and continue to put pressure on the government because, in addition to the budget that was tabled today, the Government of Quebec has the will to invest to combat violence against women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583337">I hope that what some people are describing as a social crisis will help us to understand that the domestic violence issue goes beyond battered women; it is about society's behaviours as a whole. We therefore need to be proactive and understand that psychological violence and coercive control can have consequences and can be precursors of violence. In that regard, I want to point out the work of Myrabelle Poulin, who shares powerful testimonials on this issue on her blog, “Les mots de Myra”, or Myra's words. We also need to help women break the cycle of poverty because, all too often, that is what keeps them vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583338">Anouk St-Onge, who is in charge of domestic violence cases at the Montreal police, the SPVM, recently noted that there has been a 12% increase in reported cases of domestic violence in Montreal. She lamented that more than 1,500 cases of domestic violence were reported in 2020 alone, an increase over 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583339">We know that the pandemic has cut victims off from their social support system and isolated them, aggravating the situations of domestic violence. Being trapped 24 hours a day with your attacker is an aggravating factor. At certain times during the pandemic, the drop in the number of complaints was not good news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583340">A much broader discussion is needed on the fact that domestic violence is more than the battering of women. As I was saying, it also encompasses verbal and psychological abuse, such as snooping through a partner's text messages. Signs of domestic violence are on the rise, but we have seen during the pandemic that there is a shortage of shelters in Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583341">Of course, the opposition parties at the Quebec National Assembly are calling for new funding to meet the growing needs in addressing domestic violence. For Quebec to effectively combat domestic violence by reinvesting in underfunded domestic violence prevention organizations, such as shelters, there needs to be an increase in transfers, the money must not be held back and the agreements must be reached more quickly. </ParaText>

This evening it may also be pertinent to ask if federal health initiatives are aligned with Quebec's priorities, yes or no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583343">If the past is any indication of the future, there is cause for concern. In 2014, a panel of experts on federal initiatives in the health and social services sectors from 2002 to 2013 presented a very interesting report to the Government of Quebec. I will only mention a few of the report's findings.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The federal government's initiatives in health and social services stem mainly from what is known as the “spending power” [and, in certain cases, I would even call it, unfortunately, the power to withhold spending]. These initiatives may address in part the focus, objectives and priorities of Quebec...however, most of the time, they propose and even impose targets and approaches that are different than the ones already adopted by Quebec authorities.</QuotePara>

In some cases, there can be a rather large gap between federal policies, priorities and approaches and Quebec's. A number of the people consulted indicated that, if they could manage the money spent by the federal government themselves, they would not use it in the same way. They would have different priorities and strategies. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6583346">Quebec knows its own agencies. “The federal government's funding for health care and social services is woefully inequitable for Quebec”, especially “since the federal funding does not take into account any money a province or territory may have already spent on the same item.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583347">This is important for programs that are tailored to the different regions in Quebec and Canada. In my speech at the Standing Committee on Status of Women last summer, I spoke about the CALACS I had heard from back home. In Quebec, in the middle of a pandemic, just three out of seven of these sexual assault centres had qualified for a program that directly helped survivors. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583348">Organizations need predictability, which is lacking in federal programs. There is no long-term assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583349">One last thing: We need to be careful. If this government is truly a feminist government, it must no longer tolerate violence against indigenous women and it must implement the findings in the report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583350">The government also needs to take action, after failing to respond to allegations of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces for over three years. It must no longer perpetuate this culture of silence. It needs to work to improve the gun control bill. The government should not wait until after the crisis to take action. It needs to do something now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583351">However, we need to be careful not to politicize this issue because that is not what is needed. To protect the women and girls of Quebec and the provinces and territories, we need to go beyond grim statistics and ensure that those numbers do not increase, because every death is one too many. Let us take action.</ParaText>

During the pandemic, I have held a number of meetings and round tables with women's organizations and transition houses. One of those organizations is The Cridge Centre for the Family. It runs an intimate partner violence and brain injury initiative and supports women who have experienced brain injuries at the hands of intimate partners, and the needs of the centre are greater than the resources it has. In addition, the brain injury portion of the program is currently funded just by donors and has no secure federal government funding. </ParaText>

I would like to hear her thoughts on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583375">Toxic masculinity, as I mentioned earlier, is such a huge problem. I have talked to groups like Afeas, which advocates for women's rights in Quebec. One thing we should focus on is equality, and one way to work toward gender equality is sharing housework. Another is recognizing the importance of implementing measures and rules to prevent workplace harassment. That is crucial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583376">We have heard too many stories about toxic workplaces. The Canadian Armed Forces might be an example of that, but it is just one of many. That is why it is important to have training programs to prevent workplace harassment and assault. Getting more organizations to adopt such plans is crucial.</ParaText>

Not every CALACS managed to qualify for the programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583382">This absolutely needs to be reviewed, especially since Quebec is calling for it and, as I said in my speech, there are delays in the agreements. The fact that Quebec received money five months later than other provinces is unacceptable. These delays are far too long. Let us speed up the process and ensure that we create agreements across Canada. We certainly must not forget the agreements with Quebec.</ParaText>

To do that, there must be adequate funding so that shelters have enough space and better measures to ensure the safety of women. We also needs laws like the one we passed last fall to ensure the elimination of prejudice and better training for judges for cases of sexual assault, and that victims report their aggressors. We must eliminate the prejudices still held by certain judges.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583388">Madam Chair, I will be splitting my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252678" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583389">I appreciate the debate we are having tonight to highlight this pandemic within a pandemic and to highlight the seven Quebec women whose lives were taken in the past few months and, of course, the 160 women whose lives were taken this past year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583390">Across Canada, frontline women's agencies and police report increases of intimate partner violence at 30% to 70%. We cannot continue to stand by as women's lives are ended, and their deaths cannot go without action. Often those women who are killed have suffered many violence acts prior, and a woman who is trapped without resources, financial or otherwise, to flee has too often been a victim of many different types of abuse, not only from her partner but from a broken system and those in power unwilling to do what is truly necessary to change it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583391">The New Democrats have and will continue to push to change that system and to act. That is why I am so proud to support the private member's bill from my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253064" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation>, Bill <Document DbId="10868507" Type="4">C-247</Document>, which would make coercive and controlling behaviour a criminal offence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583392">We know that intimate partner violence has been and continues to plague our society and that the pandemic has made this problem even more acute, as the numbers from Quebec show. Patterns of coercive and controlling behaviour are also forms of violence, but these patterns are often a precursor to overt physical violence. This behaviour being seen as a criminal offence would allow earlier intervention by police, courts and service organizations without having to wait for that actual violent incident to take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583393">We know that our families, communities and country are stronger when women thrive. In Canada today, it is still all too common for women to experience discrimination and gender-based violence, particularly if they are members of marginalized communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583394">In Canada, there are only a patchwork of plans, programs and supports. There is no comprehensive system in place. Shelters across Canada have been asked to do more with less year after year. Some shelters in Canada have reported not receiving funding increases in nearly a decade, but they took action. They made up the difference through their own fundraising efforts. They showed the leadership that women, children and non-binary people in their neighbourhoods needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583395">On the front lines, time, resources and money are limited, but incredible community leaders and volunteers take on that fight daily, and I am so grateful for them. During the pandemic, numerous women's organizations emphasized the need for core operational-based funding. It is necessary for any organization to be able to shift during an emergency to provide the community-based programming they know is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583396"> During the Harper government, a great deal of that funding to institutions was cut and any funding provided was made available only under specific project-based funding. Under subsequent Liberal governments, some funding has been returned, but not to the levels required and still through that same project-based funding model. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583397">Women's organizations must have long-term, stable, core funding so women can access the supports and advocacy they need when they need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583398"> For five years, the government has touted a national action plan to end gender-based violence. Whether in committee or in the House, since being elected, I have taken every opportunity to ask the government when a plan will be formalized and brought forward. Sadly, women are still waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583399">We also need action and the implementation of the calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. We must implement all 231 calls for justice. This cannot be another inquiry that sits on a shelf and collects dust. Women do not need another report only to refer to when a government has been caught ignoring the problems women face, a report like the 2015 Deschamps report on sexual misconduct and sexual harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces. The Deschamps report has 10 recommendations, yet only two have been implemented in six years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583400">Gender-based violence impacts all women of all different ages, racial backgrounds and cultural groups. Everyone is at risk and everyone is a potential victim. Those at high risk, something we have heard repeatedly during this pandemic, are people who are already vulnerable. Women living in poverty, women with a disability, immigrant women, and indigenous women and children are disproportionately affected by this form of abuse and violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583401">I must conclude with this. The problem is clear and the solutions can be clearer. These disturbing numbers of the murders of women from Quebec and across Canada underline the necessity of ensuring that the House and the government take action that is both effective and urgent. That is what I will continue to fight for. That is what New Democrats will continue to fight for. </ParaText>

We should all be terrified that we need to have a debate because there have been so many cases of femicide in Quebec and Canada. It is absolutely terrible. These are not just tragedies involving a family, an individual or a couple. We are talking about a bloodbath, something huge that should make us all shudder right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583424">The fact that seven women in Quebec have been murdered by their spouses in the last seven weeks is unbelievable. Last year, 160 women were killed in Canada because they were women. That is one woman murdered every two and a half days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583425">How did we as a society, as a community, get to the point where femicide is in the news three times a week in Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583426">In Quebec, seven women have been killed in the last seven weeks. I want to take a moment to remember them by name.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583427">Her name was Elisapee Angma, and she was killed on February 5 in Kuujjuaq. Her name was Marly Edouard, and she was killed on Feburary 21 in Laval. Her name was Nancy Roy, and she was killed on February 23 in Saint-Hyacinthe. Her name was Sylvie Bisson, and she was killed on March 1 in Sainte-Sophie. Her name was Myriam Dallaire, and she was also killed on March 1 in Sainte-Sophie. Her name was Nadège Jolicoeur, and she was killed on March 19 in Saint-Léonard. Her name was Rebekah Harry, and she was killed on March 23 in Montreal. <Sup /><Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583428">These women were not killed in a car accident or because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were simply in the wrong place. Where was that place? It was at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583429">For many women and girls in Quebec and Canada, home is the most dangerous place they can be. That speaks volumes about the problems they face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583430">Normally, in our individual or collective psyche, home is a refuge. It is the place where we are loved, reassured and comforted. It is the place we go to when we have problems in the outside world. For many people, however, home is the worst place in the world, and they must seek refuge elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583431">However, when these women seek refuge elsewhere, they learn that there are not enough shelters. The Fédération des maisons d'hébergement pour femmes, an organization that represents several dozen shelters for women fleeing abuse, has an office in Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie. I spoke with officials from this organization a few years ago, and they told me that they had to turn away around 10,000 women a year. More than 10,000 requests a year are being turned down because there is no room, no space, no refuge for these women in need knocking at the door. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583432">What happens then? These women have two choices. One, they can return home, where they will have to deal with a dangerous or violent husband or partner and continue to suffer until a space opens up. Two, they can move out, but since there is no shelter space available, they end up on the street.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583433">If they decide to bring their children with them, they end up in a catch-22. If they refuse to go home for their own safety and that of their children, they are accused of endangering their children. Our police, public and legal services have not kept up with the times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583434">We want to prevent these situations. The Government of Quebec and the provincial governments bear much of the blame for the chronic underfunding of shelters for abused women. The federal government should and could do more as well. It goes both ways.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6583456">Madam Chair, over the last seven weeks, seven women in Quebec tragically lost their lives to heinous acts of domestic violence. This is incredibly alarming and, unfortunately, is reflected in provinces all across the country. I am reflecting tonight. A death because of intimate partner violence does not just happen all of a sudden. There is a lead-up to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583457">Therefore, I will invite members to reflect with me this evening on what it is like to be in a home where one's every move could trigger an argument and any word that comes out of one's mouth could lead to a sharp slap across the face. I ask members to imagine their child watching and listening as their partner hurls profanities at them, and having to find their child later, hiding because they are too afraid from watching the abuse take place. I ask members to imagine the embarrassment, the shame and the helplessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583458">I ask members to imagine not having anywhere to go for escape, or living miles away from their closest neighbour, or not speaking the language that others around them understand, or not having a penny to their name to seek out support to get out. Where would they go? Who would they count on?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583459">Let me be clear. Intimate partner violence is prevalent in all cultures, ethnicities and socio-economic situations. In 2019, I had an event through my women's council in my riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills on raising awareness for intimate partner violence. I remember there were about 100 women who had come to this event to learn more about the supports that are out there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583460">At the end of the event, there was a very young woman who approached me. She said how afraid she was for herself. I asked her what could we do. She said, “I'm a police officer, and I still feel like this in my home.” The helplessness in her eyes that day will haunt me forever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583461">On average, 69 women are killed by intimate partner violence every year. To put that in a different context, a report by the Canadian Women's Foundation states that a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner approximately every six days. Indigenous women are three times more likely to experience intimate partner violence. Women with disabilities are two times more likely. Research also shows that approximately 28% of domestic homicides in Canada between 2010 and 2018 involved rural and remote communities. Intimate partner violence accounted for a third of all violent crime in 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583462"> In 2018 alone, about 100,000 people reported intimate partner violence to police, and 79% of them were women. This is based on data that is reported to the police. According to the police, the majority of incidents go unreported. The real number would be much, much higher. On any given night, 3,491 women and their 2,724 children sleep in shelters because it is not safe at home, and 300 women and children are turned away because shelters are full.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583463">Over the last year, more people are staying in their homes instead of going out, obviously because of the pandemic. In this environment, where there are many struggling with their mental health, victims of intimate partner violence are living full time with their abuser.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6583464">A report by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability found that in 2020 alone, 160 women were killed by acts of violence. This is one woman killed every two and a half days in our country. The Peel region, which is where my riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills is, sees officers responding to over 1,000 calls for family violence and intimate partner violence each month. That is 33 calls a day. Over the last two years, about 40% of all homicides in the Peel region were the product of family violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583465">According to Statistics Canada analysis, calls related to domestic disturbances rose by approximately 12% between March and June 2020, according to data from 17 police forces across Canada, compared to the same period in 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583466">Women's shelters and help lines in regions across the country have experienced a major surge in calls. From March to July 2020, calls to the Vancouver Battered Women's Support Services tripled, while in Alberta, calls to specialized crisis lines for intimate partner violence increased by up to 50%. Across Canada, 54% of victim services programs saw an increase in domestic violence victims during that same period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583467">From September to December alone, Canada's Assaulted Women’s Helpline saw a 60% increase in calls compared to the previous year. In April to June, they saw double the number of calls from 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583468">I have spoken to shelters and police services in my riding, and they are very worried that these numbers do not reflect the whole picture. When victims are trapped with their abuser, unable to see family or friends, it limits their ability to call for help before the situation escalates. It limits the ability for services to go out and proactively reach these individuals who are need of that support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583469">Worse still, domestic violence is not only becoming more common, it is becoming more severe. Last year, the Ending Violence Association of Canada and Anova conducted a survey of staff and volunteers working at women's shelters, and 82% reported that violence had become more frequent. Abusers' violent tactics have changed, and control over their victims has increased. They use access to technology, or the outside world, even information about the coronavirus, as a weapon. In these cases of isolation with an abuser, the scale of violence has also escalated, with one worker describing many more cases of strangulation and serious physical assaults leading to a higher risk of lethality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583470">We see the same trends echoed in our partner nations across the world. UN Women and women's organizations around the world have called this the shadow pandemic, which has grown amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and threatens to impact our communities long after this health crisis has passed. The data tells us that all types of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic violence, has intensified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583471">More needs to be done to prioritize addressing this crisis. It is vital that we continue to take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583472">Since 2015, our government has taken firm action on this issue of intimate partner violence and gender-based violence. In 2017, we launched the first-ever federal strategy to prevent and address gender-based violence to fill important gaps and support women and girls, indigenous peoples, and LGBTQ2+ members and gender non-conforming people in communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583473">We launched the gender-based violence knowledge centre to coordinate federal actions under its three pillars. We announced $15.6 million in funding for projects to end violence against women and girls. We are investing more than $50 million in nearly 60 projects to support survivors of gender-based violence and their families in communities across Canada—</ParaText>

We have been playing that role in empowering other countries around the world to take into account what gender equality means for citizenry across the world. Whether it is through funding human rights aid across the world or through empowering women parliamentarians across the world to advocate for gender-based analysis of all laws in their own nations, or through multilateral agreements and organizations providing that support, I think there is no one measure that our country can take.

I wholeheartedly support measures that we can take as Parliament to address what coercive and controlling behaviour is. We heard from many police forces across our country that changes to our Criminal Code to include a criminal offence for coercive and controlling behaviour is something they are looking forward to. I also believe that in all of our Criminal Code provisions that deal directly or indirectly with gender-based violence, we need to have a gender-based analysis conducted of them so that we can fill in the gaps as—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583499">Madam Chair, certainly one of the most profound things we do in the House sometimes is to speak in these take-note debates. Tonight, of course, is no different in terms of the incredible speeches and passion that we are hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583500">Certainly we all have a shared responsibility to protect our mothers, daughters and sisters across this country. Women, girls and members of the LGBTQ+ community continue to face violence or harassment in their homes, schools, workplaces, online and in the streets. Of course, that is just unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583501">I grew up in a household where I always say my dad was a feminist before his time. He had four daughters. I was very fortunate and perhaps naive. It was only when I headed into the nursing profession that I started to realize the scope and challenges of the problem of violence against women and domestic violence. As a young nurse working in rural and indigenous communities, my first time with a rape victim was when she had been found unconscious, lying nude in a ball diamond down the street. Then there was the first time someone came in who had been stabbed by a partner in the evening, and the first time I saw bruises on a person I knew from the community. She was wearing a turtleneck to cover-up the bruises from the abuse, in the middle of summer, and too ashamed to talk about it. I started to realize the profound scope of the issue we are facing. Certainly it continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583502">I was looking at statistics before this debate. It is a little bit hard to say whether the situation is actually getting any better or worse. Going through the statistics, it is really hard to compare apples with apples, but we do know that COVID is really making things more challenging.</ParaText>

In this case, someone out on probation was told to take care of his needs and murdered her as part of doing that. How can we have someone going out on probation with that sort of opportunity and those sorts of instructions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583505">We do know that this problem is not new, but we also know that with COVID, we certainly have a new crisis and a new sense of urgency. Maybe what we need to do is to have a special focus right now. It is a global problem, but we really need to talk about having a special something happening right now for those with intimate partners who are trapped in their homes with their abusers. The abusers are using COVID to further control and isolate people from friends and families. Again, the statistics are all very different, but one in three women will experience physical or sexual harassment and violence in their lifetime, so we have a problem in Canada. I heard one of our colleagues earlier talk about 2.5 women are killed every week by intimate partners.</ParaText>

Also, some women arrive in Canada and are shocked to learn they do not have status.

              <ParaText id="6583524">These are heinous crimes and deserve the full weight of the law applied to them. We truly do mourn every woman who was lost. Over 160 women have been lost in the last year alone to femicide in Canada. It is very disturbing to consider that this is happening in our country, of all places, yet we cannot help but ask ourselves what the underlying cause is of this type of behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583525">We heard tonight of different circumstances where I think we are not really doing what is best in our society to develop our young boys into men, who then become husbands and fathers. We hear about the after-effects a lot of times of the lives of people facing circumstances when maybe they were not taught properly about the values they needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583526">When I went to the YWCA in Saskatoon to talk with the people there about their programs, they talked about how a lot of the young boys who come into their facility are very rough around the edges. We ask ourselves what is causing this. We want to just set that aside when really one of the things, as we talked about that day, is having easy access to pornography at a very young age. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583527">On the Hill, we had an opportunity to see a film done about a wholesome family. The children were home-schooled, sitting at the table doing their homework, and this little boy, at a young age, clicked on a button that said he had to be 18 years old to click on the button but did not stop him from clicking on it. Over time, this young boy began to really act out and treat his mother and sister with an incredible level of disrespect. This was happening very quickly, in the midst of doing homework at the kitchen table while his mom was preparing a meal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583528">These are things in our society that are impacting the quality of our young men as they are growing up. In fairness, it is not just young men. We have to look at the deeper-rooted issues around violence in games. We hear all the time that we cannot deal with that, but these are things impacting future husbands and fathers, and it all starts at that level within a family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583529">I also want to make the point that we want to be developing solid relationships among people. We spend an incredible amount of time on our careers, or on getting Ph.D.s, or on things such as maybe developing a very strong ability to ski, but how much time do we spend developing ourselves into the people we would want other people to enjoy being with, and choosing to be the kinds of people other people would choose to marry?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583530">I said once when I was giving a talk that, as a young woman, I had my picture of what I would want in a man. Yes, it was strong masculinity, but not toxic masculinity. It was someone who appreciated and valued me as an individual. There are all of these types of things we want to see in those we are looking for, but we have to remember those people are also looking for that in the person they are looking to have long-term relationships with as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583531">This level of violence in relationships, where a partner is killed or controlled, does not happen in the later times. It happens over the time of preparing an individual to have character in life. Churches, gurdwaras and all of our religious institutions play a significant role in building into young people what those relationships should look like and what kind of people they want to be, as well as having character and values, choosing to tell the truth and being caring and compassionate.</ParaText>

I would encourage young people who happen to be political junkies and are listening to any of this, although it is a good topic, to realize that to be the kind of people someone else wants them to be is not as important as ensuring they have that sense of value within themselves. That is not something other people can give them. That is something they need to develop on their own.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583549">They were rays of sunshine, daughters, sisters, fantastic mothers. They were women. COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on women. During the pandemic, twice as many women as men lost their jobs. It is primarily women who work in essential services. They are working on the front lines and are exhausted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583550">The problem has become much more serious. Organizations on the ground have told us that the pandemic has deepened the isolation of women who are experiencing abusive and violent behaviour, that it has made it harder for women to leave their abusive spouses, and that it has increased factors associated with violence, such as alcohol consumption, financial insecurity and mental health problems. Lockdowns have meant less contact with friends and family, contributing to women's isolation and removing their social safety net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583551">In less than six weeks, seven femicides have occurred in Quebec. This problem is nothing new, but the crisis that has been raging for over a year has highlighted issues related to gender-based violence. The motion that was moved today was born of a concern that my colleagues and I have. The resulting discussion this evening is of vital importance. I thank everyone who has risen to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583552">We must speak out about the deaths of these women and about all victims of violence. We need to be aware of the problem. I am sure that I am not the only one here who feels uncomfortable walking or running at certain times or in certain places. Sometimes I even have to change my route when I am running because I feel as though I am being followed or because I need to avoid people who look threatening. Unfortunately, too many women can relate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583553"> In Sherbrooke, a manifesto for the safety of women garnered 1,102 signatures. I want to commend Guylaine Cliche for this initiative. These situations are just one part of the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583554">For many, it is not even possible to be safe at home. That is unacceptable. Since the beginning of the crisis, I have been in contact with social workers in Sherbrooke to stay abreast of their reality and their needs. Organizations such as CALACS and l'Escale saw their requests for support increase and their work become more complicated. I saw the challenges they are facing: the lack of funding, the staffing shortage and the lack of volunteers. Needs are growing and the services are not keeping pace. That is why I am proud to have announced last September with my colleague Minister <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">Bibeau</Affiliation>, nearly $130,000 to support them. These organizations are a lifeline for women and victims, but we know that the work does not stop there and that more needs to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583555">This evening's discussion, initiated at the unanimous request of the House, is proof that awareness of this issue is growing. That is definitely a step in the right direction. I also want to say that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has been discussing this issue for two months now. Interesting ideas have emerged from that, such as including the notions of cyber-violence and former intimate partners in the definitions in the bill. These are potential solutions that came out of expert recommendations, and they offer hope. I am very much looking forward to continuing our work on this because it will help the women of Sherbrooke and of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583556">The witnesses who appeared before the committee reminded us that few women turn to formal support resources and that many never report their situation. That may be because they are unaware of existing services, because of barriers to access or because they fear worsening violence after they report. These findings suggest that we have a lot of work to do to get rid of the stigma associated with gender-based violence. We need to be proactive. We need to work with teens on prevention and raise public awareness of this insidious form of violence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583605">Madam Chair, tonight, as we share our stories, comments and feelings about what has been happening, I would like to split my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252525" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583606">We take time to mourn the loss of seven women who died as victims of heinous acts of femicide in Quebec these last several weeks: Elisapee Angma, Nancy Roy, Marly Edouard, Myriam Dallaire, Sylvie Bisson, Nadège Jolicoeur and Rebekah Harry. May they rest in peace. My heart and prayers are with their families. May their stories compel us to take greater action to combat gender-based violence and protect women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583607">Last Saturday, Rebekah Harry was maimed and wounded in her apartment in LaSalle, Quebec. She died three days later. She was attacked by her boyfriend. Sadly, Rebekah's story is not an isolated incident. Intimate partner violence is a crisis in our country. On average, one woman is killed every two and a half days. One in three women and girls in Canada will face some sort of violence in their lifetime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583608">According to Statistics Canada, in 2018, of the 174,613 women who experienced violence, 78,852 experienced intimate partner violence. There is also the overrepresentation of indigenous women suffering domestic violence. They are three times more likely to report domestic violence than non-indigenous women. These statistics are deeply alarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583609">Unfortunately, the pandemic has exacerbated domestic violence, the majority of whose victims are women. In a status of women committee meeting, a first nations leader testified that many indigenous women were more afraid of their violent partners than COVID-19. We need to take that statement seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583610">Because of lockdowns, exit strategies are difficult to execute for women trapped with their perpetrators. In many rural areas, women do not have easy access to transportation to be able to escape to cities where they can find a shelter. As many social services have gone online, poor access to broadband in remote areas makes it particularly challenging for women to access services virtually. Both transportation and broadband services need to be more accessible to these women to give them a means to escape and find help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583611">The bottom line across Canada is that isolation from lockdowns empowers violent partners to gain more control over a woman's ability to escape. With added anxiety and frustrations from economic instability and lockdowns, domestic conflict has increased. In addition, limited social contact means fewer opportunities for friends and family to recognize and intervene in domestic abuse. With the drastic lockdown measures, we have to protect Canadians from the spread of COVID-19, but we must also take drastic measures to protect women from domestic violence. We need to provide more shelters and transition housing, and support the advancement of a national action plan on gender-based violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583612">On multiple occasions in the House, I have spoken about the need for a national framework for mental health, and I am so glad our party supports that. Family wellness is critical. We need to help the provinces provide more social work and counselling for families and individuals so they can heal, manage their conflicts better and learn to love themselves and others in healthier ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583613">We need to examine the criminal justice system and policies for law enforcement response to ensure women feel safe through their cases and do not suffer in silence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583614">Men need mentoring to know how to treat women with respect. Fathers and male authority figures need to learn to treat women with more respect and model it to counter toxic masculinity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583615">We also need to empower more girls and women to have stronger self-esteem. They need to learn how to identify and reject abusive behaviour. The problem with domestic violence is that it continues even after the perpetrator is outside of that woman's life, with PTSD and the rebuilding of their self-esteem. That is why they need support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583616">I would like to call upon my 337 colleagues in the House to stand with me in a concerted effort to protect women. It should not be a partisan issue. It is worthy of our attention and efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583617">I know there are many women out there who are feeling trapped, hopeless, unworthy and have given up on trying to leave their perpetrators. They try to leave only to give up again and again. I would like to send a message to all the women who are struggling right now with domestic violence. If they are watching, I want them to know that they are valuable, loved and beautiful, and what they are experiencing right now is not the lot they were born to live. They were made to explore life and all its possibilities. It may seem impossible for them to break free from their prison right now because their perpetrators seem too powerful for them, but the beauty and power within them is greater than the appearance of power in bullies who harm their partners. I want them to have courage and hope. They do not need to wilt. Fight for their right to live and reach out for help.</ParaText>

A lot of times, domestic violence is perpetuated by the women's financial dependence on her partner, and the goal is to help her to find more independence. I believe in the care and financial support that the government can provide at different seasons, and think it is something that requires very detailed, specific and unique models for different circumstances.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583627">Madam Chair, that is an amazing question that I appreciate. What it comes down to is that a woman needs to come to a place where she is so sick and tired of the way she is living that she hits that wall of not being able to live that way anymore, and finds the courage from that to be able to break free. If someone does not hate the situation they are in enough, then they are not going to find the courage. I want the women out there who are struggling with this to also identify with the hate they have and with the hardships they are experiencing to say that they are not going to take it anymore, and they will find that courage.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6583628">Madam Chair, I really wanted to speak tonight in this debate on violence against women because the fight to end violence against women is not just a women's issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583629">I was moved by many of the testimonies I heard from my colleagues this evening. It is important that we make the fight to end violence against women a social issue, and we must ensure that everyone gets involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583630">What prompted this debate, as we all remember, was the murder of not one, not two, not three, but seven women in Quebec in just over a month—seven women, mothers, who have left grieving children and loved ones behind. This kind of grief is difficult and unacceptable for a society like ours, which claims to be open and modern. Seven women were killed in just over a month, when the province normally averages about a dozen such murders a year, which is already far too many. To get the numbers out of the way, 160 women died as a result of violence in Canada in 2020, which is one woman killed every two and a half days. That is completely unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583631">I am sick and tired of this reality, which has only been aggravated by the pandemic. However, the pandemic did not cause this violence, which is present in so many men still today. It just exacerbated it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583632">After these events, today I called shelters back home to find out what was going on in the Mégantic—L'Érable region. I have been in regular contact with many of them for a long time. Since the beginning of the week, I have had a lot of questions about the people back home. When you live in a smaller community, word gets around when domestic violence occurs, and it is often blamed on a temporary fit of anger, emotion or whatever. Although surprising when they occur, these actions are then quickly forgotten because, unfortunately, far too many of us turn a blind eye.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583633">I have been told that since the second wave of COVID-19 hit, the shelters are always full of women who have nowhere else to go. One of the shelters I contacted told me that it provides many services off-site because it does not have enough room. Incidents of violence are apparently becoming increasingly serious, and danger levels are rising. More cases are being reported to police, and I am told that action must be taken more quickly to get children to safety. I just cannot fathom it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583634">I cannot accept that a shelter that can usually accommodate people must turn them away for lack of room. Our office had to get involved with another shelter to help a woman who had problems with the system. I will not provide further details because our community is small, but it was a very difficult situation. I was also made aware of the difficulties posed by smart phones and social media, which some violent men use to monitor their partners 24 hours a day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583635"> Obviously, these places want and ask for more money, but they especially want to see more prevention in schools, and not just starting at age 15 or 16. Even relationships among young people have the potential to be violent, and I was surprised to learn that similar behaviour can start at such a young age. We need to better educate our sons. Parents have a role to play. As a father, I have a role to play. Although my children are older, I want to do this for my grandchildren. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583636">The legal process needs to be simplified. Enough with the lenient sentences that do not always reflect the severity of the crime committed. Sometimes, a thief will receive a harsher sentence than someone who assaults a woman, and this is completely unacceptable. Stakeholders are also calling for lawyers, judges, police officers, the directors of youth protection in Quebec, and the various stakeholders to work together. Greater awareness is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583637">I now want to talk to men and implore them to ask for help before hitting or controlling a woman. These men are not alone, and violence is not a solution. As men, we must always remember that love is not controlling and love is not violent. Love is supposed to be loving. We cannot confound the notion of domestic violence with love. Men do not express their love to women through violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583638">If a man hears this message this evening, if he feels as though he is trapped in a straitjacket and he wants to talk, I would ask him to seek professional help or to call a friend but to please never again harm a woman.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583658">Can we control everything, or do we need to better educate our young people, especially our girls, about all this abundance? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583659">We need to have that debate. One thing is certain: We need to prepare them better to face life, because life is not always easy. It can be hard. We have to show our young people that not everything that lies ahead will be beautiful. Some things are hard, and we must be able to talk about them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583660">Madam Chair, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>, a strong voice for women in the House. I am happy to be sharing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583661">Today we have been taking in this place about gender-based violence, and I want to speak a bit about the continuum. Women face aggression and disrespect throughout their lives in public and in private, and we need to stop condoning and accepting this behaviour. I have an example. I love to run. It brings me calm and joy. However, before I go on a run I have to think about certain things. Will there be enough people around? Will there be enough light? Will I have a phone? This is about all the ways that women's movements are constrained. We are made smaller.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583662">I was reading a social media post by a runner. She was stopped by a man who insisted that she stop running and talk to him. It was a small thing. She wrote, “The little things that we've been socially conditioned to respond to ever so sweetly, that we are often too nice to challenge—these become the big things we can no longer ignore. Women do not exist to please men.” I do not have her name so I cannot credit her for that, but it has been shared many times. I want to thank her for this because all of these small things that are said and done to constrain women somehow say they are less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583663">I do not want to trivialize this debate. It is very important to highlight the women we have lost, in particularly the seven women in Quebec we lost recently, and the recent report about the devastating femicide numbers in our country. However, there is an atmosphere that builds toward an acceptability of deeper aggression by some people, and it is important to look at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583664">The UN says that one in three women is subjected to unwanted sexual behaviour in public spaces. Frankly, if we ask women about this, we hear so many stories. We have heard some today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583665">When I was a young teen, grown men would make comments to me about my body and would even reach out to touch me, in subways, elevators or on a busy street. No one said anything. We need to stand up and stop this behaviour. When I say “we”, I am calling on men specifically to join us in taking action to stop this behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583666">I also recognize I am a white cisgender woman, and the experiences of women are not all the same. I acknowledge that there are women who face greater risks and fears because of race, gender identity, disability and other factors. I am speaking about my own experience, and I know there are other voices that must be amplified if we are going to get this right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583667">When women are not seen as having equal value, when we are seen as being there only to support and satisfy the needs of the men in our world, that leads to greater violence down the road. The director of advocacy at YWCA Toronto said that to end intimate partner violence we can start at home by teaching men and boys to respect women. A similar point was brought home by the UN in its resource document, which says, “Start conversations about gender roles early on, and challenge the traditional features and characteristics assigned to men and women. Point out the stereotypes that children constantly encounter.... Talk about consent, bodily autonomy and accountability to boys and girls”. These are important pieces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583668">I have focused on public spaces, but some of the greatest dangers for women can be in private ones. The UN Secretary General referred to a shadow pandemic and said that some of the greatest threats to women and girls can come from their own homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583669">I want to focus on the path forward: the friends and families of women experiencing violence. Let us listen to her story without judgment and help her to form an escape plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583670">I have talked with women who run the local shelters in my community and they point out that some women fear going to shelters right now because they fear exposure to COVID. I want women to know that shelters are doing important work to help keep people safe from COVID. They are using PPE, cleaning and even running alternate sites to allow for greater spacing. Some federal funding has gone specifically to providing those resources to keep shelters safe during COVID. I want to thank the women who are running these operations for doing such an amazing job of keeping people safe in this difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583671">In summary, let us teach our boys how to respect women and girls. Let us teach our kids about gender roles and stereotypes. Let us speak out against acts of aggression. Let us collect data about what is happening. Let us listen to women and, if needed, help them build an escape plan. Let us support our local shelters and advocacy, and let us take action against violence against women and girls.</ParaText>

It is something I think about a lot as a father of daughters and sons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583673">One of the big concerns I have is that young boys are often exposed to violent sexual images on the Internet. So much of the socialization that happens is through images people see online. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252538" Type="2">Peace River—Westlock</Affiliation> and other members have tried to push for things like meaningful age verification on the Internet to try to address the fact that people are being exposed to images that shape their perceptions of what is acceptable regarding the treatment of women.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583675">Madam Chair, it is important that we think about all of the different sources of information that come to young men and women about stereotypes and about demeaning people. We should make sure to provide resources and guidance as family, friends and people in the community, specifically for things like the non-consensual sharing of images, child pornography and other types of images. We are working on legislation to deal with those online harms, and they will be important pieces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583688">Tonight's take-note debate has been mentioned several times as being historic. I have to say I was surprised to find that this is the first time in the history of this Parliament and in the history of this place that we have had a take-note debate on the issue of women murdered by their intimate partners. Violence against women is so prevalent in our society that it strikes me as strange that this is the first time Parliament has taken up the debate, but I also want to say that I am impressed with the speeches, with the sharing and with the non-partisan commitment. I regret the extent to which partisanship crept in now and then, but I think it is important to recognize that we are all in this together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583689">We recognize that we are in a society that is, whether we want to face it or not, a patriarchy that is, to its bones, sexist. We also live in a society in which we have to acknowledge systemic racism. We have to acknowledge that a lot of work needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583690">What prompted tonight's very important take-note debate was the tragic killing of seven women so very, very close together in time in Quebec, but we recognize as well that over the course of this pandemic, 160 femicides have taken place. One hundred and sixty women have lost their lives to intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583691">Many of the references have been to urban centres. There could not be a place in this country more idyllic than Saanich—Gulf Islands. I am so honoured to represent the community here, but we had, in one of the most idyllic places within my idyllic riding, a case of a woman murdered by her husband in June of 2020. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583692">I want to say her name: Jennifer Quesnel. She had three little boys. She left her husband of 18 years because she was unsafe and only went back to the home because she was certain he was not going to be there. He was there. He murdered her and then he took his own life. It left the community reeling, but it happens far too often. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583693">There is lots of good evidence and there are lots of good studies showing that men in some situations are jealous, do not want their wives to find happiness, and Jennifer Quesnel's family gave a statement to the media to say that he had killed her because if he could not be happy, he did not want her even to live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583694">Margaret Atwood is credited with something as a quote that actually was a longer commentary in which she said:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583696">This is how we live our lives. I was taken by the fact that Global reporter Mercedes Stephenson wrote a long thread on Twitter within the last number of days about what it is like in the normal course of our days as women to navigate dark places, to get from where we parked the car to where we are moving through a dark place. She describes step by step what she does unconsciously, looking around to see if she is in a safe place. Other women have mentioned this tonight. Is the area lit? A woman clutches her keys in her hand in case she needs to lash out to protect herself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583697">What I found striking was not her relating to everyone what a woman does day to day to navigate safely in spaces that are public; tonight we recognize the most dangerous spaces are the private ones. What I found astonishing was how many of her male colleagues posted comments to say how shocked they were. “This is how you live your life?” Yes, this is how we live our lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583698">We should do things differently. Let us celebrate those movements and those men who want to make a difference, like Paul Lacerte, his daughter Raven and the Moose Hide movement. Let us end violence against women and children. Let us have men step up and say what is acceptable and what is not. Let us fight patriarchy by saying we are equals at all times from our birth, baby boys and baby girls, and let us make sure that as babies they get a fair chance, that they are not subjected to trauma themselves.

              <ParaText id="6583717">Madam Chair, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="253085" Type="2">Cloverdale—Langley City</Affiliation>. As always, I look forward to her remarks. I find her to be an incredibly thoughtful individual who is constantly in touch with her constituents. I know she will add a lot to this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583718">Before I begin my comments, I will compliment the member for <Affiliation DbId="253135" Type="2">Port Moody—Coquitlam</Affiliation>. This is a member who joined our caucus after the 2019 election. She has repeatedly touched my heart with her remarks, specifically about Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and the necessity for hope. I actually think those sentiments ring true here this evening as well, as we discuss such an important matter, the issue of violence against women here in Canada. This has really come to light with the terrible tragedy of these seven lives recently being lost in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583719">As I reflect upon this and the situation within myself, my family, my circle of friends and my community, what I keep coming back to is the incredible toll this last year of being in the pandemic and working together for the collective good has taken. It has been so important, but it has come at such a price to our mental health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583720">I genuinely believe that although this problem existed, and of course it existed, as the previous speaker indicated, for generations before I was here, we have really seen it amplified in the last year with the situation of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583721">I am really happy that my <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, in his five-point plan for securing the future, has indicated he will make mental health a priority. That is of absolute necessity. Our discussion here this evening reflects it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583722">I see it in my own community. CTV here in my city has reported that before COVID-19, 5% of Canadians reported high to extreme levels of anxiety. Now we see that that number has multiplied to 20%. Self-reported cases of depression have more than doubled from 4% to 10%. When asked what they expect if social isolation continues onwards, respondents generally anticipated anxiety levels to remain the same but for depression to worsen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583723">These types of mental health impacts are the things that we are seeing playing out within the pandemic. It is taking a severe toll. In fact, there is fear that when we finally come out of this pandemic or return to the new normal, we will experience an echo pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583724">In addition, we have seen opioid overdoses spike during COVID-19, as a result of people's attempts to cope and figure out a way through this pandemic. My province recorded 301 opioid deaths from April to June of this last year, more than double the rate from January to March. We see that increasing significantly, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583725">Distress Centre Calgary has said that suicide-related calls, texts and chats were up 66% in the month of October over previous months. I could go on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583726">All to say, I think this is a problem that has existed for a long time, but the situation we have found ourselves in over the last year has amplified it beyond belief. We have to figure out a way to emerge from this as a society with the government leading the way. Unfortunately, it has led to horrific consequences, as we have come to learn.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583738">Madam Chair, I am thankful for the opportunity to participate in tonight's important debate on the Parliament of Canada's response to the disturbing rise in gender-based violence that we are seeing across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583739">Before I get to my remarks on this motion, I want to start by offering my sincere condolences to the families of the seven women in Quebec who recently lost their lives in heinous acts of gender-based violence and to all of those who have been affected by this kind of violence in our country. Canada mourns their loss and their pain. On behalf of at-risk young women across this country, I will be supporting this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583740">Tonight I would like to talk specifically about the part of the motion that calls on Canadians to do more to combat the problem of gender-based violence. When it comes to ending violence against women, we need to look at some of the root causes, and one of the most glaringly obvious cause that we seem to gloss over here is the prevalence of violent pornography. The fact that anybody in the country can log in to Pornhub and watch videos of women being raped is a serious problem that we need to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583741">Boys as young as 10 and 11 years old are easily able to access pornography, which has a massive impact on their developing brains and poisons their attitudes toward women. According to a 2010 study that analyzed 304 scenes from best-selling pornography videos, almost 90% of scenes contained physical aggression, while nearly 50% contained verbal aggression primarily aimed at humiliation and degradation. How are we allowing this to be made so easily available? How can we allow young men to grow up consuming this horrific material and expect to have a society where women are treated with the respect and honour they deserve? Why is it acceptable for men to get pleasure out of watching women being abused? Men are not born to hate women and see them as objects. The attitudes and behaviours that lead to gender-based violence are learned. We are never going to be able to protect women without addressing the root causes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583742">I watched in horror the ethics committee testimony of David Tassillo and Feras Antoon, two men who sat there in front of all of Canada as if they were merely a couple of simple businessmen. These men are profiting off the complete humiliation of women, many of them minors. They talked about ensuring the best quality experience for their customers. They said they wanted to be the best in the world at providing online entertainment, but let us be clear: This is online entertainment that traps women in a web of shame and helplessness, online entertainment that teaches men to view sex as nothing more than a transaction they can pay for on demand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583743">It is absolutely no wonder that a young, wealthy, elite politician's son could come to the conclusion that groping a female reporter is perfectly acceptable. It is no wonder that he believes he experienced things differently than she did. Of course he did. When we regularly portray women as objects, taking that object in hand is no different than grabbing a beer from the fridge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583744">It is sad that tonight that when we come here to debate the terrible scourge of violence against women, it seems that we women are again being used, that this debate might have an ulterior motive lurking below the surface. I am hoping that our words here tonight will be more than noisy gongs and clanging cymbals, that we really care about those vulnerable daughters and granddaughters who have met death far too early at the hands of an abuser. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583745">I am here to stand for young women across this country. I am here to stand for my daughters and my unborn granddaughter. I want them to know they are far more than an object to be used and discarded like yesterday's trash. They are precious jewels. Their bodies are more valuable than gold. Their ability to love and care for others is immeasurable. They should ignore the message that is hammered into their heads by the media and popular culture day after day. They are not objects. They are not for sale. They do not deserve to be treated as trash. They are priceless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583746">Together, with all Canadians, let us be the catalyst for building a better world for our daughters and granddaughters, as well as our sons and grandsons. We can do this and it just takes beginning right here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583749">Madam Chair, I would first like to correct the record. I did not say it was the sole reason. It is one of the root causes, but there are many reasons why we have this happening. We live in a world where girls are told that their value is in their WAP and how well they can straddle a stripper pole. We live in a world where Willie Pickton was able to pick up a prostitute, rape her, kill her and throw her in a meat grinder and nobody noticed. I am ashamed that instead of this being about violence against women, it seems that we are instead making this a political ploy. Please, let us make a difference for women.

This is a very core issue and we, as a Canadian society, really need to look at what we teach our young people. Absolutely, we need to continue to support our women. There has been tremendous work done during the pandemic to give assistance where needed. There has been a large increase in violence against women and we need to continue addressing that, but we need to look at the core issue and where we are really going off the rails.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583759">Madam Chair, I am so glad we are having this debate tonight. I think it has long been overdue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583760">I heard a lot of people speak. All of them were passionate and really cared about what they were saying, but I want to make a statement: COVID did not cause violence against women. It exacerbated it and exposed it, but violence against women is pervasive. It has been rooted in history, tradition and culture for millennia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583761">In history and culture, women were possessions. They were chattels. It is only a little over 100 years ago that women in this country stopped being chattel and had the right to vote. They began that long march to being treated equally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583762"> The idea of toxic masculinity, while it sounds horrible, is very real. It is real because, as women are becoming more equal and are moving forward toward equality, we find that some men who are still rooted in that history, tradition and culture do not like it, especially as women like MPs or judges begin to make decisions in influential places. These are the women who are being focused on. We need to think about that and recognize it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583763">Also, violence against women is intergenerational. We know that 43% of boys who grow up in an abusive home become abusers themselves and that 35% of girls who grow up in an abusive home marry, live with or find a partner who is also abusive. I think we need to talk about the fact that this is a reaction. What we have seen today is an absolute reaction by toxic masculinity against women moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583764">When we look at violence against the women we love, we get upset and react if they are raped or murdered, but that is not the only form of violence against women. Women experience psychological violence every day. They are being threatened. Social media have increased the ability for people to speak out against women. Social media have been threatening to women. They can be threatened anonymously on social media, and those threats are part of the violence. They do not even have to happen. Just the fact that they are being threatened with language that demeans women to make them feel less valuable and feel badly about themselves—</ParaText>

For instance, when we sit around a boardroom table with male colleagues and say something, they pretend we did not speak or put it down or make it sound silly. When women are threatened with rape, the death of their children and those types of things, they do not have to come to pass, but it is part of that act of putting women back into their places, of demeaning and threatening them. We see it everywhere. We see it specifically in the language in pornography and social media, the language that shames women, makes them feel like less than they are and devalues everything they do. It happens in the workplace and it happens at home. When carelessly we say something to our daughter or we say something to a female partner and it is putting down something that she just said, that again gives a strong message. We see it in film. We hear it in jokes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583777">I think that the member is quite right to say that this problem of violence against women did not start with the COVID-19 pandemic. It certainly did not, and there are many root causes. However, she also said that the situation has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the issues may be the kind of isolation some people have experienced as a result of the pandemic. People are not as able to connect with others and maybe share things that they are experiencing, which is much more challenging as a result of this kind of isolation. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583793">Many members spoke about intimate partner violence, toxic masculinity and offered statistics about the situation. I really do appreciate their heartfelt words. I would really like, though, to harness the energy tonight into action. As we know, behind every number is a real person, someone's daughter, a partner, a mother, an aunt, a friend, someone who is loved and deserves to be loved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583794">With the onset of the pandemic, income loss was dramatic and significant. We know that 63% of pandemic job loss was experienced by women. Other factors affecting women included things like school closures, which meant women were more likely to stay home with their children and abusers all the time. It meant that fewer people were reaching out for support and had no privacy to call for help. For some women, especially those in precarious employment such as the sex trade, their loss of income was swift and significant, yet they were not eligible to access federal emergency benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583795">In fact, PACE Society, an organization that does exceptional work in my riding in support of sex trade workers, knows all too well what that meant for so many of the women with whom it works. It had to resort to crowdfunding to generate some support for the women, because it was not able to access government support. This is in no small part the result of societal as well as the government's lack of action in addressing the structural issues, the criminalization of sex workers, which, in turn, put them in an even more unsafe and precarious position not just during the pandemic but every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583796">Parliamentarians can do something about that. It means we have to challenge ourselves to step outside our own comfort zones. It means we have to set aside judgments. It means valuing the women as they are. All too often, there is so much judgment, which escalates the stigma. Whether a person is someone in the sex trade, or struggling with mental health challenges or experiencing domestic violence, the stigma is real and its effects can be deadly. This must stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583797">Over the years, I met so many women and their children who shared their experiences with me of being in a violent relationship but had nowhere to go because they could not access support or housing. Some told me that they felt they had no choice but to return to the abuser. For me, it is not that they do not have the courage to act. The pandemic has brought to the forefront the situation and has highlighted social inequities in our communities that have existed for far too long. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583798">The biggest challenges are stemming from the collective inability to address poverty on a larger, much more comprehensive scale; the homelessness and housing crisis; and the inadequate supports for mental and physical health. COVID-19 brought these issues to the forefront and made things more dramatic, but those are the issues of many of the women in all our communities. In Vancouver East, this is especially apparent for those in the Downtown Eastside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583799">With COVID-19, this also meant an impact to less access to services, supplies, food security and even sanitation. Lack of bathrooms and sanitation options are a major problem for those who do not have a place to call home. WISH, another great organization in my riding, has been working to get some space as an extension of its services so it can get washroom trailers out back in its lot. Safe spaces now limited also means fewer spaces for people to be in the community in shared spaces to access free meals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583800">It also does not help that the perception of those who are deemed to be “lawless” in the media require significant police crackdown. This reality means that it all too often creates an even more dangerous situation for the people who are in those situations. Policing is not necessarily the primary solution. Addressing the issue of poverty and housing is. Safe, long-term housing is what is needed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583823">Some people might hear the word “femicide” and wonder what new words they will think of next, but words say more than we think. We have to call things by their true names. Violence against women is real. This is a real epidemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583824">Earlier this week, a well-known media personality in Quebec criticized people and the media for using expressions like “crime of passion” and “intimate partner violence”. He was right. What we are talking about is femicide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583825">As others before me have probably explained, femicide refers to the killing of a woman simply because she is a woman, regardless of the context. We are talking about a hate crime against women, perpetrated by men. This is still happening far too often in 2021. It happens to our sisters, our friends, our aunts, our mothers and our daughters. In Quebec, one out of three women will be a victim of domestic violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583826">The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this scourge. It is time to acknowledge the incredibly alarming rise in gender-based violence across the country. It is time to condemn gender-based violence in all its forms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583827">Just a few hours ago I learned about a woman in her 30s in Maria, in the Gaspé region, in my riding, who was hospitalized because her husband beat her on the head with a hammer. I repeat, she was beaten with a hammer. The victim apparently took advantage of the fact that her husband was working out in the garage and fled on foot to the hospital. The documents filed in court reveal that the acts of violence took place over a period of 17 years. The news is absolutely horrific. Every time we turn on the television, we hear about another tragedy like this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583828">In the past few days we have seen that people seem to finally be waking up and wanting to do something tangible. I sincerely hope that this will encourage women who are victims of violence to leave and report their abuser. I hope that this shows that we want to do better and fight with them. Everyone has a role to play to improve the society we live in, not just elected members and governments. We can certainly do more and we must do better to help these women. As human beings we can do better to eliminate toxic masculinity and to educate our boys. We must show them that violence is never the solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583829">Men must also have this conversation. I was glad to hear the Premier of Quebec, François Legault, say that there is nothing masculine or virile about lifting a hand against a woman. It is quite the opposite. It is sheer cowardice. The fact that a man, a premier, called out this problem is a good thing, but it does not solve everything. We need to keep repeating the message and driving it home to change the mentality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583830">I will come back to a concept I raised earlier. We use it more and more all the time, but we do not really know what it means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583831">Toxic masculinity is a concept that refers to the stereotypical image of a man, the well-known traditional stereotype that says a man must be socially dominant and virile, a synonym for insensitivity. Toxic masculinity is harmful not just to women, but also to men, who are drowning in contradictory messages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583832">According to the code of toxic masculinity, a man must not show emotion, cry, be afraid or break down. These gender stereotypes are sometimes instilled at school and can have serious consequences, like the ones we are seeing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583833">How do we eliminate toxic masculinity? There are not many solutions. It starts with education, socialization and example setting. A boy who grows up with a violent father is highly likely to turn out the same way in spite of himself. Children who grow up in a violent setting are exposed to a type of learning where the traditional gender roles are deeply internalized. Not only do they sexualize the parental roles, but they ascribe powerlessness to the mother and strength, violence and power to the father. Unfortunately, it is a cycle. The child grows up with this association and develops toxic masculinity because they learn early on to associate certain behaviours with the sex of the individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583834">The seven femicides over the past few weeks are a cruel reminder of the existence of physical violence, but violence comes in many forms, such as psychological, verbal, sexual and financial violence. These types of violence have serious consequences for women and their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583835">Studies have shown that one of the main reasons women leave their violent partners is the knowledge that there is help for them and their children.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="15">(2415)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6583836">These resources exist, but they are in serious need of our help, of financial assistance from the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583837">It is more important than ever for women to know that they are not alone if they decide to flee. They need to know that we will not fail them. Tonight's debate sends them a message, and it gives me hope to see men and women prepared to send the message and act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583838">I am not here to blame the government this evening. Sure, it should have done more, but we are all responsible in some way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583839">Violence against women is not a partisan issue. It is an issue that demands that we step up, join forces and work together, in spite of our differences of opinion on other issues. We owe it to all of these women who are suffering every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583840">There are already a number of solutions on the table. We have talked about education, but what, specifically, can we do at this level of government to deal with this issue? Can we work on prevention? Can we support the organizations?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583841">The pandemic has cut victims off from their social support systems and has isolated them, exacerbating the problem of domestic violence. We need to send a clear message to victims that they must not hesitate to call 911 and flee the situation. Even during curfew, the police are there to help victims. Where can they go? That is often a big fear. In Quebec, shelters are unfortunately underfunded, and the demand continues to grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583842">A Radio-Canada article reported that the organization SOS Violence Conjugale has noticed a clear trend over the past three years. For a long time, the number of calls was stable, at around 25,000 per year. Over the past three years, it has risen, first to 29,000 and then to 33,000. This year it is around 40,000. There were 40,000 calls for help from women in Quebec. This increase in the number of calls for help comes at a time when there is a serious shortage of accommodation, whether it be emergency shelters, second-stage housing that takes in women after their stay in an emergency shelter, or affordable and safe housing for the future. In 30% of cases, SOS Violence Conjugale has to ask the person to call back later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583843">Despite the shortage of spaces, some organizations were recently refused the funding they need to run shelters or social housing projects. That is what happened to the Alliance des maisons d'hébergement de 2e étape pour femmes et enfants victimes de violence conjugale, or Alliance MH2, which submitted a project to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation as part of its federally funded rapid housing initiative. This project has been put on hold and is not considered a priority. There is no way to find out whether it will be a priority in the future. However, the situation is urgent. The refusal rate for housing applications at Alliance MH2 shelters in Montreal is 75%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583844">Unfortunately, many organizations that provide social housing for women have also had their projects put on hold. That is the case in Montérégie, the Eastern Townships and throughout Quebec. I am also thinking of women in regions like mine, in the Gaspé, where there are virtually no resources and everyone knows everyone else, so victims cannot see any way to report a violent spouse who is well liked by everyone outside the home. That situation is far from easy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583845">Fortunately, there are dedicated people in the region who are fighting for these women. I will take this opportunity to commend the work of the team at the L'Émergence and Mary Grace women's shelters in my riding. They help women who are victims of domestic violence and their children. These people have been fighting for years to ensure that women have access to a safe place where they can escape their abuser and provide a safe haven for their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583846">For more than 30 years, these people have been working tirelessly to secure the necessary funding to ensure that the women in the Avignon RCM have shelter and housing, as well as high-quality counselling and support services. In fact, one project that just got off the ground is a thrift store whose purpose is to fund the organization but also help the women rejoin the workforce. It is an excellent initiative, but it proves that the financial needs are dire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583847">I am glad that the Government of Quebec says it is ready to invest more money and more resources if necessary, not just to help women, but also to provide more prevention and mental health resources to help men who have issues with violence and behavioural problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583848">That is what we need, and the federal government needs to do its part too. It has to work with the Government of Quebec and the provincial and territorial governments to accelerate investment in shelters and transitional housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583849">We have a lot of work to do, so let us get started.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6583850">Madam Chair, the member is absolutely right: Violence against women is not a partisan issue. However, it continues because there is no accountability. There is a culture of impunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6583851">All night I have been trying to get answers from certain members of the opposition to find out if they believe that a woman has control over her own body, so I want to ask the member, who gave a very passionate speech, about this. If we do not hold our leaders to account, how are we going to address violence against women?</ParaText>
