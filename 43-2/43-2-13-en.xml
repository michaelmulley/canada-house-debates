            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6280397"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (medical assistance in dying), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-7. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="6280398"> He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today about Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code regarding medical assistance in dying, MAID. The bill before the House today is identical to former Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which I was proud to have introduced in February following significant consultation among Canadians and experts. I believe this bill reflects a consensus among Canadians and I call on all of my colleagues in this place to support its timely passage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280399">As members will recall, this bill proposes a legislative response to the Quebec Superior Court's ruling in Truchon and Gladu, in which the court ruled that it is unconstitutional to limit MAID to persons whose death is reasonably foreseeable. That declaration of invalidity, which applies only in Quebec, was initially suspended for six months and subsequently extended by four months, such that it would have come into effect on July 12.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280400">We were all working toward that deadline when this bill was initially introduced. As with many other aspects of our lives, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our usual parliamentary activities and it became impossible to meet the July deadline. As Attorney General, I asked for a further extension, which the court granted, until December 18, 2020.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280401">Even though the ruling in Truchon and Gladu was suspended, Quebeckers who are experiencing intolerable suffering and who meet all the eligibility criteria except that of reasonably foreseeable death can apply to the court for an exemption that would allow a practitioner to provide medical assistance in dying despite Parliament not yet having amended the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280402">Six exemptions have been granted since Justice Baudouin handed down her ruling in September 2019, and others are under review. The availability of exemptions limits the impact of the suspension of the ruling in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280403">I would like to take a moment to note the passing of Mr. Truchon, one of the plaintiffs in the case that led to these important changes to our medical assistance in dying regime. Like many Canadians, Mr. Truchon was concerned about the impact of the pandemic on his quality of life in addition to the suffering caused by his medical condition. He want the option to obtain medical assistance in dying, which he did in April. I would like to express my deepest condolences to his loved ones.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280404">The bill before members today, four years after the enactment of Canada's first medical assistance in dying provisions in 2016, proposes a significant change to Canada's MAID regime in broadening eligibility to persons whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280405">The 2016 amendments were, themselves, a historic change in our criminal law. They created exemptions to some of the most serious criminal offences, which aim to protect one of our most fundamental values, that of human life. These exemptions sought to protect and promote another of our most cherished values, individual freedom, and more specifically, the freedom to decide when enough medical suffering is enough and to choose when and how one's life should end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280406">Health Canada's first annual report on medical assistance in dying in Canada released this past July indicates that since then nearly 14,000 Canadians have received MAID. In 2019, MAID accounted for 2% of deaths in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280407">The requirement for reasonably foreseeable natural death was part of a MAID regime that was adopted in 2016. However, we decided not to appeal the Truchon and Gladu decision because we agreed that medical assistance in dying should be available as a means to address intolerable suffering outside of the end-of-life context. To ensure the consistency of criminal law across the country, we committed to amending the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280408">Before amending the Criminal Code, we conducted an extensive consultation with Canadians. We gathered responses from 300,000 people through an online questionnaire. My colleagues, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation>, our parliamentary secretaries and I also held round tables across Canada with over 125 experts and stakeholders. The summary of these activities can be viewed on the website of the Department of Justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280409">Based on these consultations and other sources of information, the bill proposes adjusting both the eligibility criteria and the procedural safeguards to respond to the decision rendered in Truchon and Gladu. The bill also proposes allowing patients to waive the requirement to give final consent in specific circumstances so that they do not lose their access to medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280410">We know that Canadians are also concerned about other issues that are not addressed in this bill. I am thinking, in particular, of access to medical assistance in dying on the basis of mental illness. I am also thinking about advance requests for medical assistance in dying for people who are not yet suffering but fear they will be after they have lost their ability to request this assistance and who want to make their wishes known before that happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280411">The upcoming parliamentary review of the medical assistance in dying regime and of the state of palliative care in Canada will provide an opportunity to give these complex issues the time and attention they deserve. It is up to Parliament to determine the scope of this review and when to conduct it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280412">COVID-19 has delayed this important review, but I am confident that Parliament will undertake it as soon as possible. That being said, our government's top priority is to meet the deadline set by the Quebec Superior Court in the Truchon and Gladu case.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280413"> Before I discuss the contents of the bill in more detail, I would like to note the important concerns of many individuals in the disability community about changing Canada's MAID policy from a way to avoid a painful death to a means of relieving intolerable suffering. It is crucial that these concerns not be forgotten as we resume our debate. In the view of many disability groups, a MAID regime that does not limit eligibility to those whose death is already reasonably foreseeable enshrines in law the erroneous view that disability itself is a valid reason for ending life. We have also heard from individuals living with disabilities, like Mr. Truchon and Ms. Gladu, that autonomy in how they choose to live and die is paramount. These are complex and nuanced points of view. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280414">Let me be absolutely clear. Our government supports the equality of all Canadians without exception and categorically rejects the notion that a life with a disability is one that is not worth living or worse than death itself. I believe the fundamental principle that all lives have equal and intrinsic value can be balanced with other important interests and societal values, in particular, the importance of individual choice for Canadians. This balance is at the heart of the bill's objectives, which are to recognize the autonomy of individuals to choose MAID as a means for relieving intolerable suffering, regardless of the foreseeability of their natural death, while at the same time protecting vulnerable persons, recognizing that suicide is an important public health issue and affirming the inherent and equal value of every person's life.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280415">I will now go into the specifics of various elements of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280416">The bill proposes to expand eligibility for medical assistance in dying by repealing the criteria for a reasonably foreseeable natural death. Medical assistance in dying would therefore be available to people suffering unbearable pain, who have a serious and incurable disease, infection or disability, and whose medical condition is characterized by an advanced and irreversible decline in their capacity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280417">This removal of “reasonable foreseeability of natural death” from the eligibility criteria would mean that some persons whose only condition is a mental illness could be eligible for MAID. However, the bill proposes to exclude mental illness on its own as a ground for MAID eligibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280418">Our consultations and the report of the Council of Canadian Academies that studied this issue indicated that the trajectory of mental illness is more difficult to predict than that of most physical illnesses, that spontaneous improvement is possible, and that a desire to die and an impaired perception of one's circumstances are symptoms, themselves, of some mental illnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280419"> This means that it would be very difficult to determine when, if ever, it is appropriate to grant someone's request that their life be ended solely on the basis of mental illness. In no way does this suggest that persons with a mental illness necessarily lack the decision-making capacity to consent to MAID, or that the suffering associated with a mental illness is of a lesser degree than the suffering associated with physical illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280420">During second reading debate of former Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, some members noted their support for this exclusion while others raised concerns. This issue requires much more thought and debate. We feel the parliamentary review of the MAID legislation would be an appropriate forum for this.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280421">The bill also proposes changes to the safeguards, since the existing safeguards were designed to protect persons whose death is reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280422">Expanding eligibility requires changes to the safeguards, since many experts believe there are greater risks in assessing applications for medical assistance in dying from individuals whose death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280423">The bill therefore proposes two sets of safeguards. Each applies whether natural death is reasonably foreseeable or not. This is the only role that the concept of reasonably foreseeable death would play in the new regime. It would no longer constitute grounds for refusing a request for medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280424">Reasonable foreseeability of natural death, or RFND, refers to a temporal but flexible connection between the person's overall medical circumstances and their anticipated death. It allows for clinical judgment, as it requires a comprehensive individual assessment that does not have a result in a specific prognosis and clearly does not require death to be imminent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280425">Individuals may decline towards death along trajectories of greater or lesser predictability. As such, RFND is not defined by a maximum or minimum prognosis, but it does require a temporal link to death in the sense that the person is approaching the end of their life in the near term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280426">We kept the RFND standard because it provides flexibility in relation to the difficult and imprecise exercise of anticipating when natural death might occur. A natural death that is expected within six to 12 months certainly meets the RFND standard. That was made clear when Parliament adopted Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> as an end-of-life regime. It did not impose a six- to 12-month prognosis requirement to preserve flexibility, but it still considered such timelines to be within the meaning of RFND.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280427">A person's death may also be foreseeable in the temporal sense over longer periods, depending on the particular circumstances under consideration. However, having an illness that will cause death several years in the future would not normally meet the condition of RFND.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280428">Safeguards for those whose deaths are reasonably foreseeable are based on safeguards that currently exist with two changes. First, the 10-day reflection period would be eliminated. Second, the request for medical assistance in dying will no longer require the signature of two independent witnesses, just one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280429">A person paid to provide health care services or personal care who is not involved in the assessment of the person's eligibility for medical assistance in dying can now act as an independent witness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280430">During second reading of former Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, some hon. members expressed concern about removing some of the safeguards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280431">Allow me to assure hon. members that these changes are based on the comments we received during our consultations and follow through on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280432">For those whose natural death is foreseeable, many of whom spend a long time seriously thinking about what they want to do, the 10-day reflection period might unduly prolong their suffering.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280433">We also learned that people who live in long-term care facilities or in remote regions may have difficulty finding two independent witnesses. These difficulties are exacerbated by the pandemic. The independent witness confirms the identity of the person, but does not participate in assessing their eligibility for medical assistance in dying. Only one person is required for meeting that safety objective. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280434">Newly eligible persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable would benefit from additional safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that sufficient time and expertise is devoted to the assessment of their MAID request. Where death is not reasonably foreseeable, the suffering motivating a MAID request may be due to a broader range of sources that warrant greater attention before someone's life is prematurely ended, to reduce the risk of providing MAID when there is a possibility of alleviating the person's suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280435">Specifically, the bill proposes a minimum 90-day assessment period, which would require that at least one of the practitioners assessing eligibility has expertise in the condition that is causing the person's intolerable suffering. A formal specialization or certification by a medical college would not be required. The bill would also require that a person whose death is not reasonably foreseeable be informed of and offered available means to relieve suffering, such as mental health and disability supports. In addition, the practitioner would have to be satisfied that those other means of relieving suffering have been seriously considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280436">These are clarifications to the existing requirement of informed consent. It is our hope that these steps are already taken in all cases, but the Criminal Code would explicitly require them for those whose death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280437">In addition to changes in response to the decision in Truchon and Gladu, the bill would let a person whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable and who has been deemed eligible to receive MAID to waive final consent if there is a risk they will lose the capacity to consent before the date on which they chose to receive MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280438">At present, the Criminal Code requires that, immediately before providing MAID, the practitioner must ensure that the person has given express consent to MAID and that they have the opportunity to withdraw their request. This safeguard, which attests to the irreversible nature of death and the importance of obtaining consent at the point of ending life, simply cannot be met if the person has lost the capacity to consent. This seems unfair when a person has been deemed eligible and was awaiting the procedure. In such cases, the rule could push some individuals to obtain medical assistance in dying earlier than they wanted to.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280439">Under the amendments proposed in the bill, a person whose death is foreseeable, who has already been assessed and approved for MAID and has decided they want to receive it, could make an advance consent arrangement with their practitioner, setting out the date for the provision of MAID and their consent to MAID if they no longer have the capacity to consent at that later point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280440">According to round table participants and experts who looked at this question for the Council of Canadian Academies' 2018 reports, providing for advance consent in this way presents relatively little complexity or risk, and some practitioners have indicated they would be relatively comfortable providing MAID under such circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280441">The bill does not propose to permit advance requests in contrast to what I have just described as advance consent. Advance requests are documents that may be provided at some future unknown date, if and when a set of expected circumstances materializes and when the person is no longer able to give consent. This issue is significantly more complex and challenging, and it will be examined during the parliamentary review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280442">Finally, the bill would enhance the monitoring regime, which is crucial for accountability and transparency. I have examined the bill for charter compliance and I am confident that it responds to the Truchon ruling in a way that respects the charter. I will soon table a charter statement that sets out key considerations about the bill's potential impacts on charter rights and freedoms.</ParaText>

While Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> purports to respond to the Truchon decision, it goes considerably beyond the scope of Truchon, and in so doing, removes a number of safeguards that Parliament, in its wisdom, passed four short years ago. In so doing, it would pre-empt a legislative review, where there would have been an opportunity to thoroughly examine all of the issues before experts and to take into account the comprehensive reports of the Council of Canadian Academies. </ParaText>

We consulted widely with MAID service providers and with families who had gone through the process. There was a universal conclusion that the 10-day waiting period was only a source of suffering, that people who decided to have MAID had made the decision and the 10 days only prolonged suffering. I continue to hear that. The witness requirement was actually becoming an impediment for people in regions and in long-term care facilities to access MAID, so we decided to change that now.</ParaText>

It was characterized as inhumane, and we are taking it out.</ParaText>

A medical service provider is never forced to participate in this himself or herself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280472">The member is correct. He underplayed the words “under certain circumstances”, but those are, in fact, crucial. Under certain circumstances, where the person's charter right to access the service would be endangered, a medical practitioner has to give a reference. However, that is the extent of it, and that is entirely in balance with our charter provision. I would humbly submit that the hon. member's mischaracterization is erroneous.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6280473">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code respecting medical assistance in dying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280474">At the outset, I will say that the subject of medical assistance in dying is perhaps one of the most complex issues that could come before Parliament. Profound moral, legal and ethical questions are raised. Medical assistance in dying raises questions of individual autonomy, the need to respect the sanctity of life and the need to protect vulnerable persons, among other considerations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280475">It is no wonder that Canadians have such profound, deeply held and diverse views on this subject matter. After all, when we are talking about physician-assisted dying, we are talking about issues that literally concern life and death. When we, as parliamentarians, give consideration to an appropriate framework that provides safeguards, we must do so with regard to the fact that we are talking about a procedure that, when carried out, is irreversible. The patient dies. It is indeed a weighty subject of profound importance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280476"> I am certainly informed of the complexity of the issue through my experience of having, in the last Parliament, served as the vice-chair of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying. This committee was tasked with reviewing the Carter decision of the Supreme Court, which struck down the blanket Criminal Code prohibition and tasked Parliament and the committee with putting forward recommendations for a legislative response. I then sat on the justice committee, which studied Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the government's legislative response. In that regard, I am in the unique position of having been through the process from start to finish, from the study of the Carter decision of the special joint committee through to the passage of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in June 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280477">The bill before us purportedly responds to the Truchon decision of the Superior Court of Quebec, which struck down an important component of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, namely, that in order to qualify for medical assistance in dying, one's death must be reasonably foreseeable. When the Truchon decision was issued in September 2019, we on this side of the House in the official opposition called on the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> to do the right thing and appeal the decision. We did this for a number of reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280478">To begin with, it is the responsibility of the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> to uphold laws passed by Parliament. The law passed by Parliament was Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I would note that the law had been passed a mere three years prior to the issuance of the Truchon decision. It was passed after a comprehensive review of the Carter decision and a comprehensive review of possibilities for a legislative framework. Therefore, in the end, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was a carefully thought-out and debated piece of legislation. One would think that in the face of that, the minister would have appealed the decision.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280479">In addition to that, when one, having respect for this place and the laws passed by Parliament, actually looks at the Truchon decision and the reasoning of Madam Justice Baudouin, it should be all the more apparent the need to appeal the decision. Madam Justice Baudouin, in concluding that the reasonable foreseeability criterion contravened section 7 and section 15 of the charter, was driven, arguably, by a restrictive interpretation of the purpose of the law. Indeed, Madam Justice Baudouin reached her conclusion by singularly focusing on one objective of the law, namely, to protect vulnerable persons from being induced in a moment of weakness to ending their life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280480">However, that was not the only objective of the legislation. When one looks at the preamble of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, it expressly provides for other objectives, including the sanctity of life, the dignity of the elderly and disabled, and suicide prevention, yet the judge in Truchon focused exclusively on only one of those objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280481">What Parliament sought to do in providing for a reasonably foreseeable criterion was to respond to what the Supreme Court called upon Parliament to do, namely, to strike a balance between individual autonomy and the need to respect vulnerable persons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280482">The <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation>, moments ago, stood in this place and said that the government chose not to appeal the decision because it agreed with the substance of the decision. That is quite interesting because only four years ago, three years before the minister decided not to appeal the decision, ministers on that side of the House emphasized how critical the reasonably foreseeable criterion is to provide and ensure effective safeguards to protect the most vulnerable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280483">To that end I would quote the former health minister, Jane Philpott, who, on June 16, 2016 stated:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280485">Then there are the comments of the then attorney general, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253061" Type="2"> Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, who introduced Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> and stated:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">There are other compelling reasons for there to be a requirement that the person's natural death be reasonably foreseeable. First, it provides a fair way to restrict eligibility without making assisted dying available to almost everyone. Second, restricting eligibility in this way is necessary to protect the vulnerable.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280487">In the face of those objectives, it is quite a departure and quite convenient for the minister to say that he was going to effectively abdicate his responsibility as attorney general to uphold the laws passed by Parliament by allowing a single decision of a single lower court judge in one province of this country to stand. The <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> acknowledged, and we should make no mistake about it, that the effect of Truchon and its codification, by way of this piece of legislation, significantly transforms the medical assistance in dying framework in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280488">At the time of the Carter decision and when this House, four short years ago, debated Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, medical assistance in dying was thought to be an exception to the rule, not the rule. It was thought to be appropriate in certain circumstances in an end-of-life context, where one who was suffering intolerably could, upon providing clear consent, hasten their death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280489">With this legislation, it would now be appropriate to terminate human life even in the absence of a terminal illness and even in circumstances where the suffering is medically manageable. That is a radical transformation, and it creates a number of complexities around issues of suffering that might be psychological or existential and outside of an end-of-life context. When one removes the reasonably foreseeable criterion, all that is left is that one must have a serious disease, illness or disability, be in state of decline, and be suffering physically or psychologically as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280490">When one removes an end-of-life, or reasonably foreseeable, component, that already arguably subjective test becomes a whole lot more subjective, and that has the potential to put vulnerable persons' lives at risk. One can see that with those broad parameters, persons with degenerative disabilities could have their lives terminated, notwithstanding that they may have years, if not decades, to live. That has caused enormous concern in the disability community across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280491">One month after the Truchon decision was issued, some 72 organizations from across Canada, representing a cross-section of the disability community, wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> and pleaded with him to appeal the Truchon decision. They did so out of concern that persons with disabilities could be put at risk and have their lives prematurely ended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280492">The writers of the letter noted that the legislation could arguably contravene article 10 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which provides that persons with disabilities should be treated equally under the law. They note that persons with disabilities could be treated unequally because one could have medical assistance in dying made available to them for no other reason than they happen to be disabled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280493">It should be noted that the UN rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities sounded the alarm when she said she was, “extremely concerned about the implementation of the legislation on medical assistance in dying from a disability perspective.” From a disability perspective, that plea fell on deaf ears on the part of the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> in terms of his failure to appeal the Truchon decision. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280494">In light of what a significant change this legislation means, it is unfortunate that it has come to this, because appealing the decision would have allowed for time. It would have allowed time for Parliament to take into consideration the significant complexities associated with this change, a mere four years after Parliament had legislated a comprehensive regime, and it would have provided clarity in terms of informing Parliament about the scope of the framework upon which Parliament can legislate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280495">However, instead of taking the appropriate time to ensure that any legislative change respects the charter, because respecting the charter, including life, means protecting vulnerable persons, we are here with a profoundly significant piece of legislation being rushed. It is being rushed in the face of the expiration of the stay on the declaration of constitutional invalidity, effective this December. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280496">While the Attorney General and the government emphasized the Truchon decision, it must be noted that this legislation goes well beyond the scope of Truchon. It removes important safeguards, including the 10-day reflection period. It removes the requirement that there be two witnesses to confirm that a person made the request of their own free will and that the request reflected their true consent. It provides for a complex advanced consent regime, one of those complex areas when it comes to medical assistance in dying policy, and it does all of this pre-empting what Parliament had determined, called upon and legislated in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>; namely, a legislative review that was supposed to take place this spring, but is not going ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280497">Now we are in this rushed process, instead of having an opportunity for members of Parliament to come together to hear from expert witnesses, to review the state of the law, to give consideration to the comprehensive reports of the Council of Canadian Academies and to receive diverse feedback on all of these issues. It need not have been this way. It should not have been this way, and it is regrettable that the government has so recklessly put us in this position by rushing through legislation that, arguably, could put vulnerable Canadians at risk and remove critical safeguards.</ParaText>

Cailyn was frustrated by the increasing acts of racism she was seeing in the news, including in the Comox Valley where she lives. She knew that she wanted to contribute something positive to the conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280568">As an avid runner, she organized a virtual race against racism, where participants could sign up and run a 5K route of their choice and at the same time raise awareness and funds for Black Lives Matter Canada and the Black Solidarity Fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280569">Girls like Cailyn are leading social change in our communities today. They refuse to stay silent when they see injustice. However, women in the House continue to be under-represented. We need to work to change this and to encourage and make space for girls like Cailyn, because the society they are wanting to build is a better one for us all.</ParaText>

It is important that the Carter decision be respected.</ParaText>

It seems to me that the government, in the new version, has removed all of the safeguards: the reasonably foreseeable death provision, the independent two witness provision, the 10-day cooling-off period provision and asking for consent immediately prior.</ParaText>

The member speaks about the 10-day reflection period. It is unclear why that was removed when the law, as it stands, currently provides an exception for cases where the lack of capacity to consent is imminent.

              <ParaText id="6280819">Madam Speaker, I rise today in the House to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code regarding medical assistance in dying. It is long overdue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280820">I want to start by saying that the Bloc Québécois is in favour of adopting the principle of this bill, because it clarifies two aspects of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280821">The first has to do with access to medical assistance in dying when death is imminent, meaning that the person is terminal and is receiving palliative care before receiving medical assistance in dying. At least, I hope that is the case, because people in palliative care are not always the ones to request medical assistance in dying. I will come back to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280822">The second aspect has to do with people for whom death is not imminent, who were denied access to medical assistance in dying as a result of the “reasonably foreseeable natural death” clause in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. The court struck down this criterion, which was the key safeguard. This is what Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is designed to fix, and we are happy about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280823">As we begin debating the underlying principles of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, it will come as no surprise that I am discussing them. It is precisely because we, as lawmakers, did not do our job four years ago when we were studying Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, that we find ourselves debating Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280824">This is a democracy, and parliamentarians, not judges, must make the laws. We, the representatives of the people, the lawmakers, must be the voice of Canadians, especially those who are suffering. Judges only interpret the grammar of justice. They examine the laws we make, as well as the rights and freedoms, and determine whether a potential infringement of rights and freedoms is reasonable or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280825">In this case, the court has handed down its ruling: The provisions of the current law, the former Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, are an unreasonable infringement of rights and freedoms. Furthermore, before Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> was tabled, two courts had ruled that the Criminal Code, amended by Bill C-14, violated the right to life, liberty and security of the sick person suffering intolerably or with a terminal illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280826">We have to be clear about the issue at the heart of this debate: before being legal, this is an ethical debate. On one side of this debate is the paternalistic vision of the state and medical practice, while on the other side is a vision based on the autonomy of the individual and its corollary, the principle of self-determination. I know that all my colleagues in the House have good intentions. They want to do good, they want the best for patients and they are caring. I am sure that during this entire debate they will reflect the very values they are advocating and they will be just as caring and compassionate about the interests of patients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280827">However, we cannot claim to be caring and compassionate, in other words wanting to do good and what is best for an individual who has reached their breaking point at the end-of-life stage, if we are interfering with that individual's autonomy and self-determination, and if we refuse to respect their wishes on something as personal as their own death. The literature is clear on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280828">The basic question is this: What business does the state have interfering in a decision as personal as my own death? My life is my own, as is my death. No one else, and certainly not the state, is going to die in my place. The courts had to reframe the limits of the state's power to intervene because we did not do our job properly.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280829"> All I want is for us to understand what is at stake here. I am referring to the law, which my Conservative friends often put up on a pedestal. The value of autonomy is conferred by law through the principle of self-determination, especially with regard to medical care. That is what I want to discuss here today with my colleagues. Let's talk about the autonomy bestowed on a person by law through the principle of self-determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280830">In the biomedical context, the principle of self-determination is associated with an inviolable rule, namely the rule of free, informed consent. The rule regarding free, informed consent to treatment has never been challenged in emergency situations. Patients always have the right to refuse treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280831">My question for my colleagues is this: Why would it be any different for human beings experiencing intolerable suffering due to an irreversible illness or condition? Why would it be any different for competent individuals who are neither depressed nor suicidal and who have expressed a desire to live fully until they reach the limit of what they can tolerate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280832"> In the Carter decision, which led to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, the Supreme Court ruled that the provisions prohibiting medical assistance in dying violated the right to life, liberty and security of the person. People like Ms. Gladu, Mr. Truchon, Ms. Carter and Ms. Taylor have not reached the end-of-life stage. They might not even be in the terminal phase of their illness. That does not mean they have not reached, or are not in the process of reaching, the limit of what they can tolerate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280833">The court stated that the restrictive provisions in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> were effectively shortening the lives of such individuals, that they violated their right to life by inciting them to commit the act before they were ready. That is what needs to be fixed right here, right now. Bill C-14 did a fairly good job covering the end-of-life care for terminally ill patients whose death was reasonably foreseeable, with the exception of the requirement for a second consent, which is sometimes not necessary and means that people suffer even though they gave their informed consent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280834"> There is no issue for people who are terminally ill. The dying process has already begun and is irreversible. Death is imminent and foreseeable. The issue we need to address as legislators has to do with people whose death is not reasonably foreseeable and imminent. Under Bill C-14, Ms. Carter, Ms. Taylor, Ms. Gladu and Mr. Truchon were ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280835">What we, the members of the Bloc Québécois, want is respect for the moral autonomy of the dying. We often hear the expression “dying with dignity”. I must point out that dying with dignity does not mean having a sanitized death. That is not what it means to die with dignity. The dignity of a person is derived from their freedom to choose and respect for their free will. That is what it means to be a human being. That is what it means to respect a human being. When that is violated, we violate the dignity of the human being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280836">Whether the death is unpleasant or not is not the issue. The crux of the matter is to allow the human being to make a decision about the end of their life. Unfortunately, in the past, we won the right to die rather than undergo aggressive therapies. At the time, this was called passive euthanasia. The person was left to die without much attention and without death being the intent. Palliative care was still in its infancy. There was a great fear of administering one last fatal dose of medication, but it always ends up causing death. Because palliative care is still care, it does not strictly count as passive euthanasia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280837">Patients won the right to die rather than undergo aggressive therapies, because people did not use to die from cancer; they died from the treatment. Medical paternalism has at times gone too far and has been less than helpful.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280838">Today's patient-practitioner relationship prioritizes collaboration, negotiation and respect for the patient's choice. Patients alone can assess their quality of life, and that must be respected, which is why medical professionals must be transparent with their diagnoses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280839"> Patients won the battle for the right to die rather than undergo aggressive treatment, and that evolved into palliative care as we know it. For a long time, palliative care was thought of as the only solution that would allow people to die with dignity, but if that is the case, why is it still so hard for people to get that care? If that is the solution, why is there still such a shortage of palliative care units?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280840">Sometimes, even the best, most carefully managed palliative care in the world cannot alleviate people's suffering. Bioethics teaches practitioners to remember that patients come first, and that means listening to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280841">That is true for Ms. Rodriguez, Ms. Carter, Ms. Taylor and Mr. Truchon, and it is true for Ms. Gladu and many others who have continued to suffer throughout this pandemic while they wait for us to do our job. Contrary to what some people think, these individuals are not suicidal. They want to live as long as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280842">I watched a very interesting interview with Ms. Gladu. What did she say to us? What did she want? She wanted the freedom to choose. Having this freedom greatly diminishes the suffering and anguish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280843">With Bill <Document DbId="10716060" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the government said its intention was to protect the most vulnerable. Is there anyone more vulnerable than a person who is suffering from intolerable pain, who is living with an incurable illness and who is being told to go to court for the right to choose and to die with dignity? Is there anything more important and more intimately personal for an individual than their own death?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280844"> I have a hard time understanding my Conservative colleagues' argument that the state must decide for an individual, when they are so economically libertarian. Several Conservatives felt that Bill C-14 went too far. The courts said that it did not go far enough and that it violated fundamental rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280845">Elected members of the National Assembly of Quebec advanced the debate without pitting palliative care against medical assistance in dying. They chose to include requests for assistance in dying as part of a continuum of end-of-life care that is consistent with palliative care. Whether we are talking about a degenerative disease or an illness that causes extreme pain but is not terminal, let us not pit those two realities against each other. Respect for human dignity includes proper support when one is dying, which requires doctors to have the humility to recognize that they cannot always help people manage their pain adequately. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280846">Our society recognizes people's right to self-determination throughout their lifetime but takes it away from them at the most intimate moment of their lives. In so doing, we think that we know what is best for people or that we are doing the right thing, when we are actually undermining human dignity, their freedom to choose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280847">There is no more important moment in a person's life than their death. Learning to live is learning to die. Learning to die is learning to live. I say that because the clock starts ticking the moment the doctor cuts the umbilical cord. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280848">The Carter decision and the Baudouin ruling sent us back to the drawing board. We need to do our job as legislators and stop off-loading the problems and the ethical, social and political questions onto the courts. We have a job to do as legislators.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280849">There is a sociology of law. In a society, the law evolves with people's consciences. I know I am straying from the technical details of the bill, but we will have plenty of time to discuss them in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280850">The bill proposes that a person who is not terminally ill must consent twice and be bound by a 90-day period. I really wanted to talk about advance consent, since that is about all that is missing from the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280851">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> does not address degenerative cognitive diseases, which are predictable diseases. Doctors can tell patients how they will progress. People with these diseases often remain of sound mind for years and do not appear to be sick, but eventually, they become forgetful and then die. They can also experience complications from being bedridden or immobilized or conditions other than that disease. I think a person with Alzheimer's, for example, should have the opportunity to make an advance request. This bill does not take those people into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280852"> Still, I said at the outset that we agreed on the principle and the grounds for discussing this bill. We will have time to talk about these issues. I urge my colleagues to bring substantive arguments to the debate on the adoption in principle of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280853">I remember when the previous Parliament studied Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I heard arguments about how we were putting ourselves on a slippery slope. Some people were practically saying that long-term care homes would turn into euthanasia factories. If evil people are working in our health system, they should be fired, no matter what job they do, because they have no business there. I am not buying the argument that this is a slippery slope because people are evil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280854">We must assume from the outset that everyone working in the health care system is caring and compassionate. Increased health transfers would enable these people to provide better care, and maybe there would be more palliative care units in hospitals. Even though people have been saying for 50 years that palliative care is the only solution, I do not believe it is. It makes no sense that people do not have better access to palliative care in this day and age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280855">I would like to end my speech, which I trust was a substantive one, with a wish for all of us, here in the House, concerning the delicate issue of the end-of-life. I sincerely hope—which is what the patients who turned to the courts were hoping for—to face death serenely, peacefully and without suffering. That is my wish for everyone, because that is the best wish we can make for a human being. We should imagine ourselves being at peace on our death bed and being able to let go because we have palliative care to support us in our journey towards death. That is the best wish we can make for a human being. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280856"> I am therefore calling for a debate on both the substance and the principles. I am also appealing to the humanity of all my colleagues so we can finally provide an adequate response to all those who are suffering and have been waiting for far too long. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6280886">Madam Speaker, let me start by saying how much I would rather be in the House today than at home managing a small raise hand function on the screen and our own barking dogs. More seriously, let me say how much I would rather have completed this debate in March when it comes to avoiding or preventing unnecessary suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280887">COVID-19 has required us all to make adjustments. Obviously the adjustments we have to make as parliamentarians pale in comparison to the experience of most Canadians, especially those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19; those who have lost their livelihoods; those who are still struggling to make ends meet, to keep a roof over their head and to put food on the table; and those who are struggling with the pandemic while contending with life-threatening illnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280888">Let me also preface my remarks on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> with a few words on why we find Bill C-7 before the House at all. There is a tendency by both the Liberals and Conservatives to emphasize that we are here because of a deadline imposed for changes in medical assistance in dying by the Quebec Superior Court decision in the Truchon case. That is true technically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280889">However, it obscures the role of the plaintiffs in that case, Jean Truchon and Nicole Gladu, who went to court to contest the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which they found violated their charter rights by causing or prolonging unnecessary suffering for those at the end of life and for denying individuals autonomy of decision-making over the end of their own lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280890">I actually want to thank the plaintiffs today who brought us here, and also to stop for a moment to express my condolences to the family of Mr. Truchon, who left Canada a better place as a result of his attempt to improve the way we deal with medical assistance in dying, when he left us in April.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280891">When it comes to medical assistance in dying, for New Democrats, our priority has always been, and remains, avoiding unnecessary suffering being inflicted on those who are already suffering from terminal illnesses and at the same time avoiding prolonging suffering for their families who have to bear witness to that suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280892">We were glad to see this legislation come forward in February, very promptly for a new government, but we are disappointed that we are here in October, starting over again. Some of this delay was due to COVID-19, but the blame for this delay lays equally at the feet of the Liberals for proroguing the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280893">In February, there was recognition by all parties that there were two pieces of work outstanding on medical assistance in dying. First was the need to amend Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> to conform with the charter as demanded by the Quebec Superior Court ruling in the Truchon case, which found the current law too restrictive. This is the very reason New Democrats voted against Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> when it originally came before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280894">Even before the court ruling, there were many calling for changes. Those who listened carefully to the terminally ill, their families and practitioners providing the medical assistance knew well the unnecessary suffering that was being inflicted, and continues to be inflicted by our current law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280895">The second task with regard to medical assistance in dying was to conduct a legislative review of the broader issues around MAID after four years of our experience with it. This is not to be confused with a normal review of the specific legislative changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. This broader legislative review of the issues arising out of medical assistance in dying was mandated in the original legislation and was supposed to start this June.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280896">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> required that the review specifically look at the question of advance requests, requests from mature minors and requests where mental illness is the sole underlying condition, but it was not to be limited to those topics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280897">I am disappointed that the second task appears to have fallen off the agenda for the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. Early this morning I asked him to commit to starting this broader review in parallel with the examination of the changes in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. As I told him then, I put Motion M-51 on the Order Paper today to create a special committee of the House that could conduct this broader review at the same time as the justice committee deals with the urgent changes needed and required because of the court decision and because of the unnecessary suffering inflicted by our current law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280898">I want to talk about each of these two tasks in more human and practical terms by starting with very personal stories, one for each of these. It is clear to me that the current legislation has some unintended and cruel consequences. These were clearly demonstrated by what happened to a very good friend of mine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280899"> On January 1, 2019, I went to a traditional New Year's levee in one of the communities in my riding. When I arrived, I was not surprised to be greeted enthusiastically by someone I had become close friends with over 10 years involvement in public life together. I was surprised, however, to see her right arm was in a sling. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280900">I am not going to name this friend today because I did not seek formal permission from her family to do so, but I am telling her story today as I trust she would want her unfortunate experience with medical assistance in dying to make a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280901">When I asked my friend what was happening, she recounted how, suddenly and inexplicably, she began having trouble using her arm over the holidays and that she was going to have it checked out as soon as possible. A month later, she began to see other symptoms and she found out that she had an inoperable brain tumour the size of a raisin but growing, growing slowly but growing nonetheless. This was a condition that would prove to be painful, debilitating and terminal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280902">As her condition rapidly deteriorated, she began to make plans for her end of life. Just four short months after a diagnosis, my partner and I received an invitation to what she was calling a masquerade ball in her honour. My friend was incredibly brave and never lost her sense of humour or her love of life right up to the end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280903">On that Saturday, she checked herself out of the hospital to celebrate her life with us that night. Rather than, as she joked, allowing us to get together after she was gone and talk about her then, she preferred to see us before and to hear what we had to say before she had to leave. Just days later, we found out she was gone. With her death, we were not only deprived of a larger-than-life member of the local arts community. We were also deprived of a friend whose enthusiasm for life had always been infectious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280904"> Why such a sudden exit? The current law requires that those who have already been assessed and approved for medical assistance in dying be competent when the final moment to receive that assistance comes. Therefore, my friend was forced to depart weeks if not months early because she feared the loss of competence that might result from her brain tumour if she waited too long, and that this loss of competence would prevent her receiving medical assistance in dying and thus inflict weeks or months of suffering on her as the patient but also, more important to her, weeks of suffering on her family and friends who would be forced to witness a prolonged dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280905">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> would fix this by removing the requirement for final consent for those who are already assessed and approved for medical assistance in dying. This would take away the need to go early in order to avoid the loss of competence that now prevents receiving medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280906">The bill would also make the process more straightforward in several other ways. It would do so by taking away the mandatory 10-day waiting period, reducing the number of witnesses required from two to one and expanding who could serve as a witness. These are all things practitioners have told us are unduly restrictive and only end up unnecessarily prolonging suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280907">Right now, I should take a moment to thank four doctors who have been kind enough to share with me their experiences in providing, or not providing in some cases, medical assistance in dying to hundreds of patients. Again, I will not name them today to respect their privacy, but my conversations with these four incredible people have helped me understand how medical assistance in dying operates in real life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280908">I should mention one other change in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> that would have more substantial impacts. That is the removal of the requirement that death be imminent before one can receive medical assistance in dying. Bill C-7 then sets out a more restrictive process than that for those whose death is imminent and where there is more time for assessment and decision-making. However, I should emphasize, Bill C-7 still maintains the high standards set in the original legislation that in order to receive medical assistance in dying patients must have a condition that is incurable, must be in a state of irreversible decline and must face intolerable suffering. This means that Bill C-7 would not open the door for medical assistance in dying quite as wide as some have suggested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280909">My second story, also very personal, deals with one of the broader issues that the review of MAID was supposed to deal with. This story is my mother's story. My mum passed away just short of five years ago, during the debate on MAID. This is a story I have told before during the debate on the original bill, but one which still lacks resolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280910"> My mother had always been very clear with my sister and me about her wishes regarding the end of her life. For her, it was simple. She asked us that if she ended up bedridden, unable to shower or feed herself, and did not know who we were, then to please let her go. She suffered from dementia and other underlying conditions that were complicated by a serious fall and, fortunately for her, she was not forced to endure for long those conditions she had feared.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6280911">Unfortunately, the kind of advance directive or advance request that my mother had wanted to give is still not allowed under the existing legislation. I know many in my community, and more specifically, many in my own social circles, fear just such an outcome and feel that they should be able to make their own end-of-life wishes known and have them respected, just as they are now when it comes to questions of refusal of medical treatment. I tend to be of the same opinion. However, my discussions with practitioners providing medical assistance in dying have persuaded me that this question is not as simple as it appears on its face. This remains one of the important issues the legislative review of the current legislation can address and is mandated to address by Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280912">As I mentioned earlier, there were other issues that were assigned to this broader review in the original Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, including requests from mature minors and requests for mental illness as the sole underlying condition, but one concern was missed. Let me take a moment now to address the concerns of disability advocates that, with the removal of the requirement that death be imminent, there will be pressure on the vulnerable in our society to choose medical assistance in dying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280913">First and foremost, as a society we can and must do better in offering support to people with disabilities. Failure to provide necessary resources to ensure that everyone can enjoy full and equal participation in life is a current and ongoing black mark on all of us. We have only to look at the failure to deliver additional assistance promptly to persons with disabilities during this pandemic to remind ourselves how often we forget about those living with disabilities. However, we should not dismiss the concerns of the disability community about medical assistance in dying out of hand. The legislative review is the place for us to consider seriously the question of whether the existing safeguards preventing pressure on the vulnerable to choose medical assistance in dying are, in fact, sufficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280914">Before I conclude, I want to remind members that, as a society, we must do better in the job of end-of-life care. Again, COVID has demonstrated the tragic deficiencies in long-term care in ways I hope we will not ignore. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280915">New Democrats will support the bill and help expedite its passage in order to bring an end to unnecessary suffering and to meet the deadline imposed by the Quebec court in the Truchon decision, but this support has always been predicated on going forward with a larger review without delay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280916">I have drafted a motion, Motion No. 151, which I have tabled today. I look forward to hearing a positive response from the government on this. We have just heard a positive response from the Bloc, and I am hoping for a positive response from the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280917">Proceeding with Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> without proceeding with the broader review is only getting half the job done on medical assistance in dying. At the same time, failure to conduct the broader review potentially undermines public support for medical assistance in dying, which, so far, has only continued to grow. In fact, I believe this is one of the most important questions that could ever come before Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280918"> I look forward to the debate on the specific improvements that we can make to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, but I urge all of us to consider undertaking the broader review of issues around medical assistance in dying without delay.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6280920">I would highlight the theme that the member raised when he talked about the sanctity of life. It is quite clear for those who have read the jurisprudence, and I know that he has, that in both the Carter and Truchon decisions the courts talked about the notion that the charter protection of the right to life under section 7 means that when people are prematurely considering availing themselves of medical assistance in dying because they worry about being able to give that final consent and having the capacity to give that final consent, when they take their lives prematurely, it actually violates their charter rights. This was outlined in both the Carter and Truchon cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280921">I wonder if the member opposite could comment on that aspect of the decision, because it is very important in terms of the protection of the vulnerable, which is one of the things the legislation is attempting to address.</ParaText>

This review was mandated by the original legislation and was seen as an important part of the way we consider the experience we have actually had with medical assistance in dying.

              <ParaText id="6280940">Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252779" Type="2">Glengarry—Prescott—Russell</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280941">I am pleased today to speak on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code in relation to medical assistance in dying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280942">As members know, clearly we are here because of the decision of the Quebec Superior Court in the Truchon case. That decision struck down a particular criterion under both the Quebec and Canadian regimes with respect to the end-of-life nature of medical assistance in dying, which is the reasonable foreseeability of natural death criterion, in particular, at the national level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280943">I will agree with some of the members we have heard from today that this is perhaps the most important issue we have faced in the last five years of this Parliament, both in the last Parliament and today. Fine-tuning the approach to medical assistance in dying is something that is intensely personal, but also intensely important to all of us in the chamber and to all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280944">What we should know at the outset is that the court's ruling in Truchon applies only in Quebec. We heard the minister speak about this. The court suspended its declaration of invalidity for a period of six months, until March 11. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280945">It is important for this chamber to recall that on February 17 of this year, the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> filed a motion to request an extension to give Parliament sufficient time to enact an appropriate response to ensure consistency in the criminal law. Given the circumstances of COVID and the pandemic, an extension was further sought and granted in June until December 18 of this year. Therefore, December 18 is the new deadline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280946">Before I go into some of the details in the bill, I want to start out with two important provisions that relate to conscience protection. This was raised in today's debate and was also raised in the context of an earlier debate on this bill in a previous parliamentary session. I think it is critical the record be crystal clear that conscience protections are robust in this country and are entrenched in law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280947"> I am responding here to questions that were raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252804" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>. The first location for conscience protections is in the preamble to the old bill, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which states, “Whereas everyone has freedom of conscience and religion under section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280948">I have had further questions from members of the official opposition about why it is only in the preamble and not in the statute. That assertion is categorically incorrect, because conscience protections are in the statute itself. Section 9, page 8, of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which amended the Criminal Code, states, “For greater certainty, nothing in this section compels an individual to provide or assist in providing medical assistance in dying.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280949"> Lastly, the third point I will refer to is from the Carter decision of the Supreme Court, which has been the subject of extensive discussion in this chamber thus far. I am reading from paragraph 132 of the majority reasons in Carter. The court states, “In our view, nothing in the declaration of invalidity which we propose to issue would compel physicians to provide assistance in dying.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280950">Those are the three instances where the freedoms set out in section 2 of the charter are taken into account. One is jurisprudential and the other two are statutory. The fourth one is of course section 2 of the charter, which protects freedom of conscience for all Canadians, including those who practice medicine. Therefore, the assertion that somehow conscience rights are not protected or are somehow being eroded is categorically false.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280951">Another point on what is being addressed in today's debate is the notion that a culture of overly facilitating medical assistance in dying is upon us. Here I am referencing some of the interventions made again by the official opposition, particularly the member for <Affiliation DbId="252595" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation>, that somehow this government bill is pushing us further toward predatory practices by health care practitioners or toward disavowing the right to life, liberty and the security of persons who are vulnerable, including persons with disabilities. That is categorically false and is not commensurate with what is in the evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280952">The evidence that we have is that, in total, nearly 14,000 medical assistance in dying deaths have happened in the country in the last four years. The average age of the people accessing MAID is 75 years old. It is being accessed equally by men and women, 51% of the time by men and 49% of the time by women. The most common medical condition is cancer, followed by neurological conditions. In that 67% of all people who access it have cancer; second, come neurological conditions; and third, come cardiovascular conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280953">Very important, in the most recent year of analysis, a grand total of 5,444 people accessed MAID in this country. That represents 1.89% of all deaths in the country. I am saying that specifically for the purposes of the debate, because it is important for Canadians to understand that there is not some sort of culture of medical assistance in dying that is being foisted upon unwitting individuals. I will elaborate upon this going forward. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6280954">I would like to address a few aspects of this bill. The eligibility criteria have changed, as the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> mentioned this morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280955">There are two sets of safeguards. One applies when the individual's death is reasonably foreseeable, while the other applies when it is not. The bill adds new safeguards for this second category.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280956">The bill proposes allowing final consent to be waived on the day of the procedure in exceptional circumstances. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280957">Earlier in the year, the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, along with the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation>, as well as myself and other parliamentary secretaries, conducted a very vast consultation process. We heard from 125 individuals, who are experts in this field, whether they are delivering it or acting on behalf of disabled individuals, from nurses, doctors, etc. We also heard from 300,000 Canadians through their responses to a questionnaire that outlined various scenarios. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280958"> The views of those individuals were quite concrete in the direction they were seeking. They wanted to be empowered in terms of their autonomy, dignity and their choices. They were seeking fewer obstacles to what had evolved to become an overly restrictive regime, as identified by the court in Truchon. That important feature must be canvassed here. What is important to understand is that the input received was critical to the development of the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280959">As part of the proposed amendments to the Criminal Code, the reasonably foreseeable death provision will be removed from the eligibility criteria. This is in response to the Truchon decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280960">In terms of legal impact, this amendment would mean that people whose death is not reasonably foreseeable would be eligible for medical assistance in dying if they meet all of the other eligibility criteria.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280961">This point is very important. The bill proposes to exclude persons whose sole underlying condition is mental illness. This has been touched upon by different people who have already intervened in the context of today's debate and in previous debates in the previous session of Parliament. This is important, as was outlined by the minister this morning. It recognizes the increased complexities and risks associated with such cases, which were highlighted by many practitioners, stakeholders and experts at the main round tables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280962">What is also very important is that the Canadian Mental Health Association supports the position we are taking with respect to excluding mental illness as a sole underlying condition. This complex issue must be examined carefully as part of the parliamentary review of the legislation on medical assistance in dying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280963">Importantly, the Government of Québec has also announced the exact same study for the exact same provision in the context of mental illness. Issues of consent and capacity and properly being able to diagnose this and having a prognosis are critical. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280964">I will move to some of the comments that have been made. It is important for people to understand the safeguards are under two tracks. Those safeguards respond to persons whose deaths are reasonably foreseeable and those whose death is not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280965">With respect to some of the aspects raised in the context of today's debate, please understand we have taken the 10-day period of reflection out of the legislation. The basis for this was that the safeguard was not doing the work it was meant to do. As opposed to protecting those who were vulnerable, it was increasing vulnerability insofar as it was prolonging suffering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280966">We have heard some people were so concerned about their inability to provide their final consent after 10 days that they would stop taking their pain medication, which was simply creating further suffering just to maintain the ability to provide final consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280967">With respect to how we can ensure informed consent is applied when it has not been solicited actively, there are two responses. This is with regard to the advanced consent regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280968">The government is conscious of the Audrey Parker situation and we are seized with it. When people have been assessed and approved for this procedure and when they make a determination they want to access it and provide consent in writing, that consent would be sufficient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280969">In direct response to whether it could be vitiated, yes it could. First, if the person has not lost capacity, consent could be vitiated. Second, it could be done by a physical gesture that could be interpreted to fully and finally eliminate that consent for the purposes of the practitioners. That is in response to a question posed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252830" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280970">This bill strikes a balance and the balance is important, a compassionate response that protects vulnerable people, respects their dignity and autonomy and what is required by the Constitution. I am very hopeful we can achieve all-party consensus on this fundamental issue. </ParaText>

I had a note from Jule Briese. She cited that her husband, Wayne, who is challenged with Alzheimer's, currently meets the criteria for medical assistance in dying as long as his window of capacity for informed consent does not narrow, preventing this. He has ongoing appointments at three-month intervals with his geriatric psychiatrist to assess his capacity for consent. She cites that this is extremely stressful, and could result in having to make this choice sooner rather than later. Legalizing advance requests for those with dementia to make the choice for MAID compassionately supports the individual's right to end-of-life choice guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </ParaText>

It underscores the very sensitive and delicate nature of what we are facing. What I can say in all candour is that we had a regime that had been deemed overly restrictive by courts. We have expanded the regime to allow for greater accessibility to medical assistance in dying. The notion of an advance consent is applicable here, but not yet an advance directive. That is something that was studied by the academic council when it looked at three separate areas. It would form part of the parliamentary review, and it is something that merits scrutiny. The safeguards that need to be put in place are that much more rigorous. That is why it is not inserted into this bill, but is something that obviously merits a lot of scrutiny and consideration going forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6280987"> In September of last year, the Superior Court of Quebec handed down its decision in the Truchon and Gladu case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280988">The court found that the eligibility criteria of the federal and Quebec provincial legislation on medical assistance in dying that required a person to be at the point of reasonably foreseeable natural death, or at the end of life, were unconstitutional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280989">The federal government did not appeal the Truchon decision. Despite the short time frame, our government felt it was critical that any amendments to the law should be informed by evidence and feedback provided by Canadians, provincial and territorial governments, and key stakeholders. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280990">That is why, during January and early February, our government launched an online public consultation and hosted round tables with stakeholders from across the country. During this process, participants shared their views on key aspects of the law governing MAID, including eligibility requirements, safeguards and advance requests. An online survey led by the Department of Justice ran for two weeks in January. The survey closed with over 300,000 responses: the largest number of responses the department has ever seen for any public consultation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280991">Our government also hosted a series of 10 roundtable meetings in eight cities across the country. More than one hundred participants representing nearly every province attended these national and regional meetings, including academic experts, health care providers, medical and nursing regulators and other stakeholders. While the meetings included some representation from indigenous communities, a specific roundtable was also held with indigenous stakeholders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280992">Our government’s ultimate objective is to have a law that facilitates access for those who are eligible for MAID and provides protections for vulnerable people. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280993">Feedback from both the online survey and round table discussions indicated wide support for removing the eligibility requirement that an individual's natural death be reasonably foreseeable. There is general comfort among Canadians and stakeholders with the idea that MAID should be available to eligible individuals who are suffering intolerably, but not necessarily at the end of their life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280994">Many organizations representing persons with disabilities expressed concerns about the removal of the requirement for reasonably foreseeable natural death, pointing to the potential for societal harm if disability were to be seen as a reason to terminate life.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280995"> Concerns were raised about extending MAID to include specific medical conditions where individuals may be more vulnerable, in particular, to those with mental illness. Most felt it was too early to allow MAID for persons with mental illness as their sole underlying medical condition and advocated taking additional time to study this issue.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6280996">The concerns about access to medically assisted death for individuals whose sole underlying medical condition was a mental illness were consistent with the findings of the Council of Canadian Academies report on this topic. As mandated by the 2016 legislation, our government commissioned three independent reviews on topics that were not included in the law at the time: requests by mature minors, advance requests and requests where a mental illness is the sole underlying condition. Of the council's three reports, the one addressing mental illness was the source of the greatest divergence among the experts. Ultimately, they could not reach consensus on ways to address the complexities and mitigate the risk associated with mental illness and MAID.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6280997">Many round table participants expressed support for creating a two-track system of safeguards, depending on whether a person's death is reasonably foreseeable. Many respondents to the online survey were open to the idea of some stronger safeguards for people who are suffering but not dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280998">The proposed legislative changes include new or modified safeguards for individuals when their death is not reasonably foreseeable. It is proposed that one of the physicians or nurse practitioners assessing an individual's eligibility for MAID would need to have expertise in the individual's medical condition. In addition, individuals would be subject to a 90-day assessment period to ensure enough time is devoted to exploring relevant aspects of the person’s situation and to discussing possible options to alleviate their suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6280999">During the round tables, participants expressed overwhelming support for removing the current requirement for two persons to witness an individual's MAID request. They cited the difficulties in finding independent witnesses based on the current definition in the law, which excludes health care providers and personal support workers. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6281000">Many individuals living in nursing homes or other residential settings have limited family or social networks. The amended legislation would reduce the required number of witnesses to one, and would not permit individuals who are paid to provide personal care or health care to take on this role. Anyone in a position to benefit financially, or in any material way, from the person's death would not be allowed to act as a witness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281001">The witness's role is strictly to confirm that the person seeking MAID has actually signed the request themselves. Safeguards, such as ensuring that the person signed the request voluntarily, are the responsibility of the practitioner who provides MAID, not the witness. We also clearly heard that there is no obvious benefit to the 10-day reflection period. We are proposing to remove this requirement from the legislation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6281002"> The third area of consultation was on the issue of advance requests. This is also one of the topics studied by the Council of Canadian Academies as part of their independent reviews. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6281003">Although many people speak of advance requests in general terms, the issue can be very different depending on an individual's situation relative to a diagnosis and when they are eligible for MAID.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6281004">The CCA report pointed out that not all advance requests are created equal and outlined several scenarios. It noted the most straightforward scenario is where an individual is nearing death, and has been found eligible for MAID, but fears losing capacity to consent prior to the procedure. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6281005">This was the case, for example, in the widely publicized case of Audrey Parker: the Nova Scotia woman battling late-stage breast cancer. She feared that she would lose the ability to provide consent later on, before the date she ideally wished to have the medically assisted death she was authorized to receive.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6281006">A more complicated scenario arises when an individual has been diagnosed with a disease such as Alzheimer's but has not yet come to the point where their circumstances make them eligible for MAID. However, the person may wish to outline the conditions under which they would like MAID to be provided in the future, when they no longer have capacity to provide final consent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281007">Nearly 80% of respondents to the online survey agreed that the revised law should allow for advance requests in both scenarios. However, there were concerns about allowing advance requests post-diagnosis. There was near unanimous support to refer this more complex scenario to consideration during the parliamentary review process. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6281008">The amendments we are proposing reflect the overwhelming support for the first scenario by permitting individuals who have been assessed as eligible for MAID, and whose death is reasonably foreseeable, to provide consent in advance if they lose capacity before their preferred date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281009">Our government is committed to maintaining an ongoing dialogue with indigenous groups on the topic of MAID, to ensure their families and their many diverse voices continue to be heard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6281010">Lastly, it is important to note that, across the board, participants in the round table consultations all agreed on the importance of having appropriate health and social supports in place, including palliative care, assistance for persons with disabilities and mental health services, to protect against individuals choosing assisted dying due to the lack of adequate supports to live a dignified life. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6281030">The bill was introduced as a response to a Superior Court of Quebec decision made on September 11, 2019. That decision found that the law was too restrictive in the requirement for death to be reasonably foreseeable in order to access medical assistance in dying. At the time, we called upon the government to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281031">As we debate the bill before us, we still do not have the clarity that we could have had if the government had appealed that decision. Rather than defend its own legislation, this government has used this as an opportunity to broaden assistance in dying legislation in this country without doing the fundamental consultation and homework necessary to get an important decision like this right. Even in the previous legislation, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, there was to be a mandatory review of assistance in dying legislation and what flowed from it, which was to take place this past summer. This government circumvented all of that with this new legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281032">When the government passed Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in the 42nd Parliament, it required this review to be conducted this year. The review was to analyze the state of assistance in dying in Canada in a comprehensive way, and instead of waiting for that, we see with this legislation the government going far beyond what had to be done to respond to the Quebec court decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281033">This topic is a very sensitive issue for many in the House who have personal experience with it and, indeed, it is a sensitive issue for many Canadians. We ask that all members on each side of the House be aware of this. While there may be disagreements, we are each here to represent our constituents and arrive at legislation that best protects Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281034">I have heard directly from many Canadians who are concerned about the lack of protection for conscience rights for health care professionals in both the bill before us and the original MAID legislation. As the government looks to broaden the legislation further, it becomes even more important that the conscience rights of health care professionals are protected. By further expanding medical assistance in dying, the government risks reducing the number of medical professionals willing to take part in this process. It is also important to note that this expanded access could result in a heavy emotional burden on those health care providers, as we head into uncharted territory with the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281035">We, as members of Parliament, cannot appreciate the burden that this has put on health care providers who are working in this system and providing medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6281036">Further, there are very few protections in place for medical professionals who do not want to participate in the process and may be penalized, as a result, by an employer. This is a point that I raised when Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document> was introduced earlier this year, and it is disappointing to see that it was not corrected in this version of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281037">This brings me to my next point about standing up for Canadians with disabilities. The 10-day waiting period, which could already be waived in the legislation for extenuating circumstances, has been removed. I heard the chief justice say today that removing the 10-day waiting period was universally accepted in his consultations across the country. I wonder who he has been talking to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281038">Yesterday I spoke with a group that represents those with disabilities across the country at Inclusion Canada. Those in that group said that they are in favour of maintaining the 10-day waiting period, and their role is to stand up for individuals with disabilities. It is interesting to note that they called on the minister of justice at the time to appeal the decision of the Quebec court. They said that medical assistance in dying must have limits. Individual rights must be balanced with protections, not only for our most vulnerable citizens, but also for society as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281039">One of the most important foundations of our Canadian society and identity is that we are a caring, compassionate country. For those with disabilities, their experience now is that they are told, often bluntly, that they would be better off dead. The Foley case in London, Ontario, is one example of this. This decision, if it remains unquestioned, will simply erode provincial health responsibilities for expert clinical care and social support for people who are fragile. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281040">The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> would also be familiar with a letter written to him on October 4, 2019, which was signed by over 70 organizations that stand up for Canadians with disabilities from coast to coast to coast. They wrote that they found the decision by the Superior Court of Quebec to be very concerning. One of the reasons for this concern was that the decision failed to respect Parliament's authority to balance the interests of the individuals with the interests of society, effectively limiting Parliament's capacity to pursue social targets, such as substantive equality and inclusion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281041">They describe the decision as a dangerous precedent, writing, “The Supreme Court must weigh in on this flawed analysis. The decision will entrench stereotypes and exacerbate stigma further for Canadians with disabilities.” The letter continues, and I agree, “[We] must avoid sending a message that having a disability is a fate worse than death.... Canada must appeal the decision to prevent additional stereotyping”. The letter concluded by urging the government to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281042">Again, the letter was signed by over 70 organizations, including the Council for Canadians with Disabilities, the Canadian Association for Community Living, Disability Law Centre, People First of Canada and the Canadian Mental Health Association. I mention this because it underscores how we need to get this legislation right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281043">Last November, the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association and the Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians issued a call to action due to ongoing confusion in the general public regarding hospice, palliative care and MAID. Quite frankly, palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life and symptoms through a person-centred approach for those living with life-threatening conditions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281044">The federal government should be looking for ways to improve further palliative care across Canada, as was committed to many times by the government. In their call to action, the groups I mentioned state, “Less than 30% of Canadians have access to high quality hospice palliative care, yet more than 90% of all deaths in Canada would benefit from it.”</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6281065">Madam Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. It is a very serious matter. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="252500" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation> just mentioned, it is a matter of life and death. I was part of the debate on the original bill, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, and I am familiar with a number of the issues with that bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281066">It is very disturbing to me. I understand with the Quebec court decision the government had to make a response of some sort, but the previous bill required them to do a fulsome parliamentary review, which was supposed to take effect this past summer. The government refused to let Parliament sit this summer and do the kind of fulsome work that needed to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281067">It is actually quite irresponsible that when the government introduced Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, instead of just addressing what was time sensitive in responding to the Quebec decision, it went further and took actions without doing that fulsome review of how things have been going with Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in the last number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281068">For those watching at home who are not familiar with Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, the bill would repeal the provision that requires a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable. In addition to that, it would specify that people whose sole underlying condition is mental illness are not eligible for medical assistance in dying. It would create two sets of safeguards that have to be respected before medical assistance in dying can be provided to a person, and it would permit medical assistance in dying to be provided to a person who has been found eligible to receive it and whose death is reasonably foreseeable but who has lost the capacity to consent before the medical assistance in dying is provided. That is sort of an advance consent, and we will talk a bit more about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281069">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was not without some issues that were not addressed in the previous legislation and will probably be considered in the fulsome review. There was a question about whether minors should be able to receive medical assistance in dying. There was significant discussion about advance consent. A lot of Canadians were demanding it, and I will talk a bit about some of the considerations that may have kept the government from moving ahead at that time. There was discussion of those who are not mentally competent to give consent. There have been a number of speeches today mentioning people with dementia, for example. That is another area where there was work done by the Council of Canadian Academies, the CCA. It did fulsome reports on a number of these things, and I will talk a bit about what was found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281070">There was discussion today about the protection of conscience rights, and I do not agree necessarily with the <Affiliation DbId="253813" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. I see the charter provisions that were put into Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, but forcing somebody to refer, when they do not want to have anything to do with the process at all, is actually violating their rights. I am not a fan of violating one person's rights to give another person their rights. That is not good, so we need to have more discussion about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281071">In its report, the special committee that studied the Carter decision said that, without good-quality palliative care, people really cannot make a true decision. They really do not have a choice. Obviously I have been an advocate for palliative care. My private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="8286156" Type="4">C-277</Document>, on palliative care, was unanimously passed in the House and in the Senate. The government did a good job of putting the framework in place to get consistent access for all Canadians to palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281072">The problem is that, once the framework was in, the government has since really not pushed ahead. There are 70% of Canadians who have no access to good-quality palliative care. Especially in the time of COVID, where people are dying, it is becoming even more important. The government needs to take action to up its game on palliative care to make it more available to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6281073">There is an opportunity and a responsibility for the government to show leadership in how palliative care is being implemented in Canada. Right now, for example, British Columbia is violating the World Health Organization's requirements for where MAID should be performed. It has specifically said that palliative care is a different thing from medical assistance in dying and that they should not be performed at the same location because of a tendency by people wanting palliative care to be afraid that they will accidentally receive medical assistance in dying against their wishes. There is an opportunity for the government to revisit that and I am hopeful that it will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281074">With respect to the Council of Canadian Academies, many issues were studied. On the advance directives and advance consent issue, we see in this legislation that the government is allowing people who believe their conditions are going to decline and are eligible to receive medical assistance in dying to have a 90-day advance consent. It is not clear to me in the legislation when the 90 days start. Is it when patients first have discussions with their physicians? When does the clock start? That is a clarification that is needed in the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281075">When the council looked at advance directives, it said there were a few difficulties. The first one was how to prove people have informed consent, what the criteria are and what the definition is of that. Therefore, that would have to be addressed. Who decides what is intolerable suffering, especially if the person has lost capacity? That is another question that needs to be and should be considered in this fulsome review that is required and that I would have preferred to have had before this bill came forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281076">As a point of information, Belgium and Luxembourg only allow an advance directive when a person is permanently unconscious. That is the only way they will allow a person to have an advance directive in place: If they become permanently unconscious, they will receive medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281077">On the issue of minors, “mature minors” would have to be defined. In Quebec, that is defined as people aged 14 to 17. However, we have to make sure they have the capacity to make medical decisions and confirm they understand that it is voluntary and they are not under duress. There are not many jurisdictions that have extended this to mature minors. The Netherlands does allow people aged 12 to 16, with parental permission, to have medical assistance in dying, and those aged 16 to 18 with parental consultation. Belgium allows it if the person is terminal, but pediatric palliative care has to be provided as an option. Therefore, there needs to be further discussion on that one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281078">Then there are those who suffer from mental illness. I was very pleased to see that it is clear in this legislation that they would not be eligible. It was very controversial. The council that studied it could not agree. There was discussion about the capability for informed consent and the fact that people with depression could have good and bad days and may change their minds, which again points to the need for some kind of cooling-off period. The Netherlands allows this but for dementia only, and there is still a lot of controversy about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281079">The safeguards that were in the bill originally seem to have been removed. I am not a fan of doing that because I would say that if we remove the conditions that have to be met in order to get something, more people will take advantage of it. I am concerned with a broader creep on this, but I am sure there will be fulsome discussion about this at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281080"> In Canada, everyone has the freedom to express themselves, to believe what they want and to choose what they want, and we should treat everyone's individual choices with respect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6281085">I will give an example from the first year after Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> came into law. Sarnia—Lambton has a huge capacity for palliative care. We have a hospice with 20 beds. There are also beds in the hospital, and we have home care. We have an integrated palliative care system. There were two requests for medical assistance in dying in the first year. London, just an hour away, has a population that is about three times larger than Sarnia's population. It had 300 requests for MAID because it does not have adequate palliative care services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281086">The government can help out with establishing hospice. The virtual palliative care work that has started is very helpful, especially in rural and remote areas, but it of course requires broadband Internet access. The government can also use some of the successful models, like using paramedics in their off hours, to deliver palliative care. These things could really boost the existence of the supports people are being counselled about, and then people could take advantage of them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6281095">We have a serious issue before us, the issue of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. It has been an excellent debate so far and an excellent opportunity for members on all sides to talk about this issue because it goes to our morality and to our own conscience, and we are hearing from all sides about this. I want to say that we got it wrong with the last piece of legislation; we got it wrong with Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I want to commend the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> for coming forward with Bill C-7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281096"> I would also like to recognize a few members who were vocal advocates, working on the justice committee with Murray Rankin at the time; the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>; my friend, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252719" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation> and many other members of the Liberal caucus who tried to advance medical assistance in dying so that it would be constitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281097">I am here today to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which proposes amendments to medical assistance in dying legislation. Members are aware that the Superior Court of Quebec found the eligibility criterion of reasonably foreseeable natural death from the Criminal Code made legislation to be unconstitutional. The court delayed the effect of the ruling to allow both the federal and Quebec legislatures to respond. The government has agreed with this basic principle of this decision and is now proposing to amend the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281098">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes to repeal the requirement that natural death be reasonably foreseeable. It would create two sets of safeguards: one for those whose death is reasonably foreseeable and another for everyone else. Some of the existing safeguards for those who are dying would be relaxed, and for everyone else there would be a different set of safeguards based on the current ones with some additions and clarifications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281099">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes to continue to use the expression, “reasonably foreseeable” natural death, but as an element that determines which set of safeguards to use and not to use it as an eligibility criterion, which was the issue in the Truchon case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281100">The proposal to distinguish MAID requests on the basis of whether a person's death is reasonably foreseeable is consistent with the view that MAID for people whose death is reasonably foreseeable presents less risk and complexity than other circumstances, and that the assessment of requests should be tailored to these different types of cases. Having a reasonably foreseeable natural death would also be a critical element for another proposed amendment in the bill. Currently, the MAID law requires the practitioner to give the patient the opportunity to withdraw consent or to affirm their consent just before MAID is provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281101"> This requirement for final consent is a safeguard; however, it has also caused some MAID patients to choose to end their lives earlier for fear of losing their capacity to provide final consent and, sadly, for some to be denied MAID entirely after losing capacity. I would also like to point out that others chose to decrease their intake of painkillers prior to MAID being provided, to ensure they retained capacity to consent, which leads to an increase in suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281102">Bill<Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> would allow for a possible waiver of requirement for final consent for individuals whose death is reasonably foreseeable but where there are fewest risks and complexities in providing MAID to a person who is no longer able to consent. Permitting this proposed waiver of final consent would respond to scenarios like that of Audrey Parker of Nova Scotia, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer that had spread to her brain leaving her uncertain as to how long she would have the capacity to consent. Because she feared losing capacity before her preferred date to receive MAID, she scheduled MAID and ended her life earlier than she wanted. She openly expressed how she felt unfairly forced by the limitations of the MAID law to schedule MAID sooner than preferred and called for amendments to the Criminal Code so that others like her would not be denied the freedom to choose their preferred date to receive medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6281103">I would recommend that all members listen to the speech in the previous session from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252495" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>. I believe Audrey Parker was a constituent of his. He powerfully used her own words to show us where we went wrong, the impacts our failures in the previous legislation had led to, and the impacts on her life. We owe it to people like Audrey Parker, who have been assessed and approved for MAID, to respect their need for freedom in making end-of-life choices. As a compassionate society, we know we can do better to support these individuals. These amendments seek to do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281104">Waiving final consent is, however, an ethically complex question. This is because it involves MAID being administered to a person who is no longer able to consent, or to withdraw the consent they previously gave. Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes a new approach for patients whose death is reasonably foreseeable, who are assessed and approved for MAID when they have the capacity, and who make very specific arrangements with their practitioner in which they give consent in advance to MAID being administered on a specific day, even if they have lost capacity by that day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281105">I fully support permitting advance consent for this group of individuals, but at the same time, I note that certain protections must be in place. Specifically, if on the specified day for MAID, the patient has lost their capacity and they nonetheless actively show signs of resistance to the MAID procedure, or behave in a way that indicates a refusal, the practitioner must not follow through on the procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281106">Medical practitioners at the round table expressed concerns in relation to the emotional burden that could arise from such situations, for them and for family members. They talked of possible disagreement with family members on whether to end the life of a person who appears to resist the procedure. A similar situation led to the prosecution of a MAID provider in the Netherlands and made headlines around the world. That situation is what we wish to avoid here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281107">That is why Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes an additional provision that states that signs of resistance from the patient would make the advanced consent invalid on the specific day and going forward. While an incapable person could no longer withdraw their consent from a legal perspective, given their track record and decision-making capacity, it is proposed that MAID not be permitted under this circumstance. The approach provides much needed clarity for practitioners and family members that MAID be prohibited if the patient is resisting. The bill would also make it clear that an anticipated reflexive response, like flinching when the needle is inserted, does not count as resistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281108">It is important to be clear, however, that this amendment is not about advance requests. Advance requests for MAID refer to a situation in which a person puts in writing they would want to receive MAID at some later date when they are not able to consent to it, if circumstances arise that they predict would cause them unbearable suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281109">In this situation, a person is not asking for MAID now. Instead, they are putting in writing that they want it at a later date on the basis of anticipated suffering that has not yet happened. The most likely scenario would involve people who are diagnosed with conditions that could lead to dementia, such as Alzheimer's. These people would want to have a plan in place if their worst fears should come to pass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281110">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> does not propose to allow MAID on the basis of advance requests. MAID in these circumstances would be extremely complex, would avoid ethical challenges and would require more time to consider such measures. In speaking to the Attorney General, I voiced my concern that we need to spend more time considering these measures. I hope that the issue will be studied during further upcoming parliamentary review of the MAID legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281111">Taking more time to study advance requests is consistent with the approach of the Government of Quebec, which is also moving forward to hold public consultations on the issue so that all of its dimensions can be better understood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281112">MAID is one of the most sensitive and challenging social issues we are currently faced with. Recognizing how deeply personal this issue is to so many people, and to so many members of this place, the government has listened carefully to the diverse opinions of Canadians and has considered the expertise shared by experts, MAID providers and other experts in the development of this important piece of legislation. Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> responds to the Superior Court of Quebec ruling, but it also achieves balance that respects personal autonomy, while protecting the vulnerable as well as equity rights for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6281113">For these reasons, I call on all members to support the bill.</ParaText>
