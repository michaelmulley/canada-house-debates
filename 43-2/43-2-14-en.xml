              <ParaText id="6289073">Before resuming debate, colleagues, I would like to make a statement regarding members participating via the video conferencing system during debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289074">On separate occasions, on October 7 and 8, two members encountered technical difficulties when the video feed was lost, either during or prior to their intervention. In the first instance, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252606" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation> was allowed to continue with audio only, but objections were raised when the member for <Affiliation DbId="252807" Type="2">Calgary Midnapore</Affiliation> was invited to do the same the following day at the start of her speech. This led to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252759" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House</Affiliation> to seek direction from the Chair should the House be faced with similar situations in the future.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289075"> I want to thank both members for their intervention. While the special order of September 23 specifically requires that members voting by video conference have their camera on for the duration of the vote, it remains silent on the issue of members speaking in debate. For this reason, the Chair exercised caution and flexibility, knowing that proper authentication was not in question and that the House could decide how to manage this situation as it did on Thursday, October 8.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289076">Since then, as I understand, consultations with the parties have taken place and all recognized parties have concluded the camera must be on for the entire intervention. A course of action to manage any technical difficulties was therefore established and agreed upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289077">When members lose visual contact prior or during a speech, the Chair will interrupt the proceedings momentarily while the technical issue is being addressed. At the same time, the table will consult with the member's whip to determine if an adjustment to the rotation list is being considered. If the member is unable to start or resume the intervention fairly quickly, debate will continue by proceeding to the next member on the rotation list unless there is an agreement to accommodate the member having the technical trouble.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289078"> To avoid such situations and allow the House administration to provide the necessary assistance, I remind members participating by video conference to connect well in advance of their scheduled intervention. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289079">As we move through the technical intricacies of hybrid sittings, I invite House officers to consider and address the unexpected and unintentional effects that virtual proceedings can sometimes have on the work of members. Their collaboration and assistance are appreciated.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6289083">Mr. Speaker, allow me the opportunity to reflect on what has brought us to this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289084">Shortly after the 2015 election, a number of pieces of legislation were brought before the House. One of those pieces was Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, a direct response to courts and the many concerns Canadians had with regard to the issue of dying with medical assistance. The issue was thoroughly discussed and debated. A lot of dialogue took place inside and outside the chamber, and, in fact, across the country. The number of Canadians who were engaged in the legislation was extraordinarily high. That was reinforced earlier this year, but I will get to that particular point later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289085">Back in January or February 2016, there was a great deal of dialogue taking place. Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> ultimately passed just prior to the summer break, in June 2016. At the time, parliamentarians recognized that there would be a need to make some modifications. In fact, within the legislation we passed, we created the opportunity for us to review it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289086">It should come as no surprise to anyone that the issue continues today. Even without legislation, dialogue has been taking place among members of Parliament and constituents. I have had ongoing feedback on the issue, in particular through emails, since 2016. People have expressed concerns and issues with the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289087">The Superior Court of Quebec made a determination on the legislation, which ultimately dictated that we had to bring in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. We had initially introduced the bill earlier this year, I think in February. Prior to its being introduced, Canadians were once again formally called upon to provide their thoughts on the issue. It was amazing that in a relatively short time span, we heard from in excess of 300,000 Canadians. People from all across the nation responded to provide their thoughts and ideas on what they would like to see the government and members of Parliament deal with on this very important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289088">We were very hopeful that a committee would have the opportunity to meet and review the legislation, with the idea of looking at ways it might be changed. Then came the pandemic. As we all know, the focus and attention of Canadians changed, just as the House's priorities had to change, in order to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a direct result, we lost the opportunity for that parliamentary group or committee to get together to review the past legislation, and in fact even the legislation that was being proposed in January or February.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289089">Fast-forward to where we are today. Bill C-7 responds to a decision of the Superior Court of Quebec. It is a reasonable and acceptable piece of legislation that, in this form, makes some changes. It deals with some very difficult issues. For example, it drops the number of days of waiting from 10, after a person is approved and in a near-death situation. I believe this will generally receive good support from all sides of the House. There is the reduction of witnesses from two to one. From what little debate there has been thus far, I believe this has the potential to receive good support. The criteria that a person's death must be reasonably foreseeable is an issue that no doubt will be talked about at great length, both in the chamber and at committee. There are other aspects of this legislation that I find very compelling, and I am very interested to hear what people have to say about them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289090">A big concern I have is the idea that someone is able to provide consent today but, as an illness or a disease continues, might be prevented from being able to give consent knowingly later, thereby disallowing them from having medical assistance in passing. I know many Canadians share that concern. I am expecting to see a good, healthy discussion on that, whether inside the chamber, in committees or in our constituencies, where we receive feedback.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289091">There is the issue of mental illness and the severity of it. This area is worth ongoing exploration, in different ways. As a former member of the Manitoba legislative assembly, I remember that often when we talked about spending money in health care, mental illness was nowhere near being part of the discussion. In fact, it was a very dear friend of mine, Dr. Gulzar Cheema, who raised this issue at a time when very few people raised it. In general, it is something we need to debate more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289092">I suspect that as we continue the debate, whether in the chamber or at committee, we will see that it is very emotional for a number of people. I know first-hand how important palliative care is, through the experience of the passing of family, in particular my grandmother and my father. I am very grateful for the Riverview Health Centre in Winnipeg for the service in palliative care they provided. To be there at the passing of my father meant a great deal for me personally, as I knew that when he was there he had the love and care of professionals who deal with people who are passing on. A person has to have a very special heart to deal with that. I had a similar experience with my grandmother, at St. Boniface Hospital. They are two totally different institutions, but the thing they have in common is the supports that are there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289093"> I believe we need to do more in the area of palliative care, and I would love to see more discussion, more debate and more action on the issue. I believe the federal government has a role to play in that area too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289094">To conclude, I will emphasize for members that here is an opportunity for us not only to look at the core of the issue and have discussions, but to look at some of the issues surrounding end of life and the circumstances that, either directly or indirectly, we are all somewhat familiar with.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289097">Madam Speaker, that is an excellent question, and that is why it is so important that Ottawa work with provincial jurisdictions. Health care, which incorporates palliative care, is administered by the provinces. The palliative care units that we often talk about are administered through our provinces. Ottawa has a role to play through standards and financial support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289098">We can learn a lot from the provinces. Some provinces deal with health care in different ways, such as urban versus rural. There are opportunities for us not to reinvent the wheel, but rather to look at who is doing it best: look for best practices and ensure that there is some sense of a national standard so that, when our loved ones need palliative care, their ending days are appropriately taken care of.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289102">Madam Speaker, I do not necessarily know all of the details. Within the legislation, from what I understand, the issue of second consent is important, as is the impact that it has on people who have a deteriorating illness. Today, they might be in a position to give consent, but in their dying days they might not be in that same position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289103">I believe there is an attempt to deal directly with that issue within the legislation. It is a good question, and I suspect it will be asked once it hits the committee stage.</ParaText>

Considering that in Alberta, in particular, there are many communities where doctors have been leaving because of current fights with our provincial government, how will the government deal with the fact that some people will not be able to access doctors? Those doctors are not working in remote or rural communities right now, for that second track of the MAID.</ParaText>

I talked about my own experiences with death. I have watched other families go through these issues as well. We talked about how we could be part of making those last few days, months, and sometimes years work well and make sure of the necessary resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289109">I am coming to this debate speaking from two sides, and am almost sitting on the fence on this. I am bringing forward a letter from Richard Sitzes, who is the chair of Our Choice Matters, part of Community Living Elgin. I would like to read this letter into Hansard, because I think it is very important to hear the voices and concerns of those who are disabled. I am also going to read some Twitter posts from the late Mike Sloan. Other people have covered this, and those in London would know that Mike Sloan passed away on January 20, 2020, with medical assistance in dying. He had a very difficult time, but he shared his experiences through his Twitter feed. Because of my work here in Parliament with those with disabilities, I had started a relationship with him and discussed what life looked like and how we were to move forward. </ParaText>

Bill C-7 will make it possible for a person who has a disability to choose medical assistance to die, even if they are not close to death. We strongly believe that removing the end-of-life requirement will increase negative ideas and discrimination against people who have a disability. It will grow the idea that life with a disability is not worth living. We are afraid that people who have a disability will feel pressured to end their lives even if they are not close to death. This has already happened in Canada, and it will get worse because of Bill C-7.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6289115">I was fortunate to follow up on this letter with Richard last week. He has been a volunteer, not only in my office but in our community, for decades. He is a person we see at every volunteer opportunity. He is there at community events to lend a hand. He looks at his life and recognizes that he has so much to give to our community. I have never met a kinder soul in my life. He just wants to help and at the same time wants to be heard. Having had the opportunity to sit down and talk to Richard, I know his concern is that he will not be the person making that choice, but that it will be made for him. He told me that he did not know who would have the final choice. This is something that Richard, who just celebrated his 60th birthday on August 15, is very concerned with. When I look at Richard, I do not see his life as being worth any less than mine. He has so much to offer to all Canadians. I hope we recognize it is imperative that we have appropriate safeguards for people like Richard who have so much to offer. </ParaText>

He was able to share with Canadians, especially in my region, his everyday struggles of living with cancer. As I indicated, I had created a bond with Mike over the last number of years. When he called to tell me he had cancer, the two of us talked about what he would be going through. </ParaText>

Mike had already pinned to his desk area his plans for his own funeral, with the date to be determined. He knew what he wanted in life. He was also a very strong advocate for those with disabilities, but when he got cancer he knew that there were going to be struggles. It was not just his mental capacity he was concerned with, but the physical pain he was going through. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289125">Going back to January 18, Mike wrote, “When it's getting too frightening to drink liquids because they may simply spit back up or choke me, you know, let's be honest about choices here.” To me that statement by him is extremely impactful. Another day he talked about being afraid to get in the shower. He was afraid of falling in the shower. He would get in and fall and started thinking that even though he was a young guy he might need a bench. He was going through all of those different issues each and every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289126">Mike was diagnosed with stage four thyroid cancer in February of 2019. He tweeted about his experiences with palliative care and the care he received. It was interesting for anyone to watch this as he would show his belly, which had different things attached for his pain medication. The thing that was so incredible about this man, for any of the other members from the London area, is that he had an incredible sense of humour. He would post a picture of his belly tied to a medical bag that he called his “little purse,” which contained his pain medication. He would also show the different tubes that he would inject the medication in to make the pain go away. He was in absolute pain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289127">He wrote on January 7, “I've never died before, so I don't know what it feels like, but if agonizing pain, difficulty breathing, a fever and inability to sleep are symptoms, I'm getting there.” This was a man who did not fear death, but recognized that it was going to happen. He was also a man who would go into the hospital and just be released. What was actually really comical was when he went in with shortness of breath and walked out saying he was being released with pneumonia, but was walking and doing well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289128">Thinking of Mike, we have to find the right balance.

              <ParaText id="6289149">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today, but I find it difficult to be speaking to another attempt by the Liberal government to endanger the most vulnerable in our society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289150">After just four years, when the original euthanasia and assisted suicide legislation came in through Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, we find ourselves considering legislation that would further loosen restrictions, eliminate safeguards and confuse our country's understanding of the sanctity of life and the government's role in end-of-life decisions. Once again, we have been told that in order to uphold the charter rights of some we must endanger the rights and freedoms of others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289151">I did not support Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> for many reasons. The first is the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada invoked such controversial and flawed legislation, which has been proven to be poorly applied around the world. The Liberals also chose to broaden the scope of the legislation, going far beyond the Carter decision. Another reason is that it has been placed ahead of and continues to overshadow any significant palliative care initiative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289152">In 2019, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to expand eligibility criteria, and on September 11 of last year, the Superior Court of Quebec ruled that it is unconstitutional to limit assisted suicide or euthanasia only to those whose death is reasonably foreseeable. Without even appealing the ruling and seeking the advice of the Supreme Court, which has been long occupied with this matter, the Liberals accepted the ruling. They are now rushing to change the law for our entire country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289153">They gave Canadians a mere two weeks to have their views heard on this deeply personal and complicated issue through a flawed online consultation questionnaire. The use of convoluted and biased language left little to the imagination in terms of how the government planned to legislate assisted death. I too tried to fill it out, and I would argue that many opposed would have been discouraged in participating due solely to the language used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289154">With such a flawed method, and with no idea if the feedback even remotely reflects the actual views of Canadians, how can the government proceed with this legislation in good faith? This is a rhetorical question because it does not seem to matter to these Liberals. It is clear they used this brief window for feedback to satiate the need for a consultative process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289155">We also know the government ignored its own timeline for a review of the original assisted suicide legislation, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. It was planned for this summer, and instead, we have been presented with this reckless legislation. In the midst of COVID, this was still something very important. Without a proper review and without input from the Supreme Court, this House has been asked to greatly broaden the scope of assisted suicide and euthanasia without a clear enough understanding of whether the current regime is being consistently interpreted or properly enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289156">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is being rushed through. This is concerning. When reading through this bill, I see elements that go beyond the scope of the Superior Court of Quebec's decision, namely, Bill C-7 would eliminate the 10-day waiting period between the date the request is signed and the day on which the procedure is carried out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289157">The application of the law pertaining to those whose death is reasonably foreseeable has been problematic from the very start of this debate. We know a person's reasonably foreseeable death is a flexible estimation, taking into account all of their medical circumstances, without a prognosis necessarily having been made as to the specific length of time they have remaining. The elimination of the 10-day waiting period for persons whose death is reasonably foreseeable would create the conditions for someone with an indeterminate length of time remaining in their life, possibly years, to be rushed to the decision to receive assisted suicide and euthanasia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289158">Aside from simply eliminating what most Canadians would consider to be a reasonable period of reflection, this element of the bill also ignores the possibility of medical advances and improved treatment methods in an incredibly innovative medical science environment. As Cardinal Collins has said, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> creates the conditions where an individual can seek a medically assisted death faster than the wait time for a gym membership or a condominium purchase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289159">I also see no logical reason why the government would reduce the number of independent witnesses required for when the request is signed. It is down from two to one. The government has even relaxed the definition of someone who may serve as a witness, including medical professionals or personal care workers, even those who are paid to provide euthanasia and assisted suicide on a daily basis. This is in clause 1(8).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289160">Surely we can agree that, for the vast majority of those requesting euthanasia and assisted suicide, the requirement for two independent individuals to witness a request to end a life is a reasonable safeguard. How do the Liberals plan to properly protect patients from potential malpractice? How does the government plan on ensuring requesters are presented with a myriad of treatment options rather than just one opinion?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289161">The legislation continues as a series of safeguards the medical practitioner must adhere to before providing assisted suicide to those whose death is not reasonably foreseeable. One of these safeguards would require a medical practitioner to discuss with the person the means available to relieve their suffering, including palliative care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289162">The safeguard is even weaker for those whose death is reasonably foreseeable, requiring the medical practitioner to merely inform the person of these vital options. The government failed to follow through on its promise to invest $3 billion in long-term care, which includes palliative care. There does not appear to be any political will whatsoever to improve palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289163">Canadians have also been calling on the government for a long-awaited national strategy for palliative care. There is a thirst among Canadians for real solutions to end-of-life care. The government seems all too willing to ignore the 70% of Canadians without access to palliative care and, instead, attempts to impose on them a flawed, one-size-fits-all regime. We can already see the consequences of pushing forward an assisted dying agenda when there is little regard for palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289164">In British Columbia, the Delta Hospice Society was stripped of 94% of its operating budget for refusing to provide euthanasia in a facility intended for the provision of palliative care. Despite repeated attempts to defend its Charter-protected, faith-based objection to being required to provide euthanasia and reach a compromise in good faith, 10 hospice care beds are now at risk and will be surely defunded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289165">Why do the Liberals continue to ignore the voices of those who have a different perspective on the issue of end-of-life care? People who seek hospice care are seeking it for a reason. They do not desire a medically assisted death. In effect, what has happened in B.C. is an attempt to redefine what constitutes palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289166">In fact, the Fraser Health Authority's decision flies in the face of the Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians, which has clarified that euthanasia and assisted suicide are distinct from palliative care. I caution Canadians not to regard the Delta Hospice Society's situation as an isolated one. The government has shown little interest in supporting hospice care, and I would not be surprised by further attacks on the ability of Canadians to chose to end their lives naturally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289167">In The Globe and Mail, Sarah Gray put it well, stating, “The hospice isn’t a place where people come to die. It is where they come to live — to live well for the little time they have left. It is a place of celebration, connection, comfort and support. It is a place of safety for the dying and the grieving.” In Cardinal Collins' words, let us work to create a “culture of care”, rather than rush toward a culture of “death on demand”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289168">The government would also be wise to recall that much of the debate on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> revolved around calls for a solid framework of conscience protection for medical practitioners involved throughout the end-of-life process. At committee, witnesses stated that the protection of conscience should be included in the government's legislative response to Carter v. Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289169">The Canadian Medical Association confirmed conscience protection for physicians would not affect access to physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. Its statistics indicated that 30% of physicians across Canada, or 24,000, are willing to provide it. I live in a rural area of Canada, and I can assure members there are many provisions that are not available to me directly where I live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289170">Unfortunately, the Liberals failed to defend the conscience rights of Canadians in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I also found it disappointing that they failed to support, in the last Parliament, critical legislation put forward by David Anderson in Bill <Document DbId="10118341" Type="4">C-418</Document>, the protection of freedom of conscience act. It would have made it a criminal offence to intimidate or force a medical professional to be involved in the procedure. It would also have made it a criminal offence to fire or refuse to employ a medical professional who refuses to take part directly or indirectly in MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289171">Here we are four years later, and Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is also void of any provisions that would protect the section 2 rights of Canadians. In Canada, everyone has freedom of conscience and religion under section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. No one has the right to demand all services from all providers in all circumstances. As David stated, protections are needed for doctors and health care providers who are not willing to leave their core ethics behind when they are at a patient's bedside. Access to euthanasia and conscientious objection are not mutually exclusive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289172">We, as legislators, must ask ourselves where the Liberals will draw the line. There will always be the voices of those in our society who feel that the limitations and safeguards are too stringent. When will it be enough for the Liberal government? How far are they willing to go? What message are we sending to the most vulnerable and fragile in our society?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289173">Over the last five years I have advocated for our veterans. I know there are countless veterans who appear able to cope with debilitating physical injuries, but they are extremely vulnerable in their mental health. We are all concerned about the number of them choosing to end their lives by suicide because of complications after serving our country. It is antithetical to try to prevent them from taking their own lives, yet tell them that there are government-designed opportunities to do so. </ParaText>

The concern is that at what point do we come to a decision on what the responsibility of the government is. I understand we want choice, but the problem is that there are not enough safeguards for those individuals, where it is creeping into a sense that their rights and privileges under the charter are being challenged. That is what I expressed here. Right now we are at the place where we are the line between those who want a certain thing and those who do not. Someone's rights will be trampled if we do not deal with this very carefully.</ParaText>

However, the Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians has said that there is creep where palliative care facilities are being shut down because the physicians do not feel they should be providing assisted suicide or euthanasia, and their rights are being trampled upon.

              <ParaText id="6289190">This is a very difficult bill and subject for us to deal with. In this case, the sanctity of life, something that all of us cherish, conflicts with the liberty interests protected under section 7 of the charter. This is one of those difficult times where we have to recognize that our own religious views, our own moral views are not the ones we can simply impose on Canadians. We have to recognize that charter rights are sacrosanct. Sometimes, as a member, those are difficult moments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289191">I personally have said before that I would not choose medically assisted dying for myself. Nor would I encourage family members to avail themselves of the opportunity for medically assisted dying. However, I also fully respect the right of every Canadian to choose for his or herself whether this right should be exercised personally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289192">In the Carter decision, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld that under section 7 of the charter, there was a certain subgroup of Canadians whose liberty interests were violated by the existing provisions in the Criminal Code on not assisting someone to commit suicide. The Supreme Court in Carter told us that there was a subsection of Canadians, those who were in constant enduring pain and suffering that could not be alleviated by medical treatment reasonably acceptable to them, who had the right to have their death hastened by having medical professionals assist them in doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289193">In the last Parliament, our government brought in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I had the privilege of being the chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. We heard from a great cross-section of Canadians. We heard from those who represented the disabled community and those who believed in the right to die with dignity. We heard from members of the clergy from all faiths. We heard from university professors, lawyers and doctors. We heard from a great cross-section of Canadians who had very diverse and different opinions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289194">What we tried to do was craft a law that brought Canadian society together, that protected the vulnerable but yet still afforded everyone the right that the Supreme Court had recognized in Carter, which was the right to decide for one's self whether to terminate one's life in the event he or she was in enduring pain and suffering that could not be alleviated by medical treatment reasonably acceptable to that person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289195"> As well, we had to recognize that when we dealt with the Carter decision in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, Canada was at the beginning of a list of countries dealing with medically assisted dying. There were very few countries in the world that had gone where Canada was going. Belgium, Holland, Uruguay and a few American states were, but that was it. Canadian society needed to come to terms with medically assisted dying and learn more about the process before we went too far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289196"> That is why, at the time, I supported a clause in the bill that said that medically assisted dying was limited to those whose end of their natural life was reasonably foreseeable. However, we knew that would change over time and that as Canadian society looked at the experience of medically assisted dying, the bill would come back for review before Parliament and would need to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289197">At the justice committee, we proposed a number of important amendments to that bill. We inserted, by unanimous agreement at the committee, conscience rights to ensure that the doctors, nurses and pharmacists whose own beliefs would be offended by medically assisted dying were not compelled to participate in the process. We said that Parliament would need to review some subjects that we were not dealing with, such as the issue of mental illness on its own; the issue of mature minors; and, probably most important, the issue of advance directives for those suffering with dementia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289198">We also adopted a motion that palliative care had to be part of that review. People should have their death hastened because palliative care treatment is not available to them in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289199"> This bill takes the medically assisted dying regime, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, a step further based on the Truchon decision. It held that the provisions we had put in the law about reasonably foreseeable death were not constitutional and that a subgroup of Canadians who may have many more years to live but were in constant pain, enduring interminable suffering, and could not have that alleviated by medical treatment reasonable acceptable to them also had the right to medically assisted dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289200"> This bill establishes that this group of people also have the right to medically assisted death in Canada, but also imposes additional safeguards on them, namely a 90-day waiting period. We understand that certain people, for example, may suffer a traumatic injury and need time to consider all their options and come to terms with their situation before finally going through with a medically assisted death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289201">Also, based on the Canadian experience, we are amending the bill to allow certain Canadians who are about to lose their ability to offer agreement to medically assisted dying, because they have lost their capacity to consent, to do an advance consent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289202">Some Canadians want to access medical assistance in dying knowing that they may still have a few more weeks to live. The only reason they want to access it sooner is that they do not want to lose their capacity to consent to medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289203">Personally, I want these people to be able to continue to live and spend those last few weeks with their families. I do not want them to end their lives prematurely because they are worried about losing their capacity to consent to the procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289204">The amendment to the law, this bill that is before us, gives hope to this group. These people will have permission to sign a contract with their doctor indicating that they want to put an end to their life on a specific date, even if they lose the capacity to consent to medical assistance in dying in the meantime.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289205">However, there is still a safeguard in the sense that if people who have lost their capacity to consent show through any action or words that they no longer wish to end their life, the doctor must then stop the procedure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289206">I strongly support the bill. I think Canadian society has evolved with respect to how we see medically assisted dying. As Canadians, we now have seen where the procedure works and where it does not work. We have seen which groups have been positively impacted and which groups have been left out and where we can improve on the procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289207"> Following a great deal of consultation and national interest and seeing a change in how Canadian opinion sees medically assisted dying, this bill is the right one at the right time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289215">Finally, I would say that, regarding the issue of capacity to consent in advance to medically assisted dying, this is simply for somebody whose death is already foreseeable, coming up in the very near term, to agree with their doctor to end their life if they have lost the capacity to consent to further prolong their life, because otherwise they would make that decision more prematurely.

              <ParaText id="6289223">I am pleased to speak in favour of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code, medical assistance in dying. As hon. members know, this bill responds to the Superior Court of Québec decision that struck down the eligibility criteria that naturally occurring death be reasonably foreseeable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289224">In the last Parliament, I spoke during debate on the original MAID legislation. At that time, I talked about the need for us to have conversations with loved ones about death and dying. “Death” is a word that elicits strong emotions. We celebrate life, we embrace life and we talk about living. However, we avoid talking about death. We shy away from those conversations because they make us uncomfortable. I know there are those who feel this legislation goes too far. However, regardless of where people fall on this legislation, I think we can all agree that the way we deal with and talk about death needs improvement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289225">Whether a grievously ill patient chooses to die at home or in a palliative care facility or chooses medical assistance in dying, we should be having these conversations sooner and lovingly assisting those who are ill in the end of their life. These decisions are often made during a health crisis. Ideally, each of us should be engaged in advanced care planning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289226">I would like to share the story of Bob Lush, an incredible man, respected lawyer and my friend. Bob and his wife Maureen shared a love and bond that was obvious to all who met them. Bob died on March 17. This summer I had lunch with Maureen and she shared with me the decision they took to use MAID. With Maureen's permission, I would like to share Bob's story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289227">Bob had been diagnosed with multiple system atrophy and pulmonary fibrosis. He also exhibited symptoms of Parkinson’s. While his body was failing him, his mind was as sharp as ever. Over time, these serious health issues would worsen, which led his doctors to tell him that he was palliative and that there was nothing more they could do. A palliative care nurse asked if they had thought about MAID and provided them with a brochure. It was not an option they had considered before, but Bob and Maureen together decided that this option would be the most loving way for Bob to leave this earth. I cannot possibly put into words the tremendous love these two shared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289228">Maureen described for me Bob's last days. They chose March 17. All medical equipment was removed from Bob's room and it was filled with flowers and candles. They loved listening to James Taylor's “American Standard” album, and it was playing. Maureen and Bob's son John were by his side. As <I>Moon River</I> played, the doctor administered the MAID drugs. Bob closed his eyes and peacefully, painlessly and humanely passed away. To hear Maureen describe it, I could hear both the love in her voice and the sadness of losing Bob, but she had no regrets and, in fact, wanted Bob's story to be shared so that other families could consider this option for their loved one, if it was the right decision for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289229">The legislation before us here today would update our MAID laws in several ways. The bill would maintain existing safeguards and ease certain safeguards for eligible persons whose death is reasonably foreseeable. New and modified safeguards would be introduced for eligible persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable. Persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable, who have been assessed as being eligible for MAID and who are at risk of losing capacity, can make an arrangement with their practitioners in which they provide their consent in advance, which allows the practitioner to administer MAID on a specified day, even if the person has lost their decision-making capacity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289230">For persons who choose MAID by self-administration, a person could waive in advance the requirement for final consent in case complications arise following self-administration, leading to loss of capacity but not death. These new safeguards would exclude eligibility for individuals suffering solely from mental illness. It would also allow the waiver of final consent for eligible persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable and who may lose capacity to consent before MAID can be provided. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289231">This legislation would also expand data collection through the federal monitoring regime to provide a more complete picture of medical assistance in dying in Canada. These are important changes and ones that have been called for since 2016, when the government responded to the Carter decision with its original legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289232">Since MAID became legal in June 2016, there have been more than 13,000 reported medically assisted deaths in Canada. This figure is based on voluntarily reported data from the provinces and territories prior to November 1, 2018; and the data collected under the new monitoring regime after that date. MAID deaths as a percentage of all deaths in Canada remains consistent with other international assisted-dying regimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289233">The government undertook extensive consultation in order to update the MAID legislation. In January and February 2020, the Government of Canada engaged with provinces, territories, Canadians, indigenous groups, key stakeholders, experts and practitioners to receive their feedback on expanding Canada's MAID framework. Over 300,000 Canadians participated in online public consultations between January 13 and January 27 of this year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289234">It is important to recognize that MAID is not the right option for everyone. We still have work to do to educate Canadians about end-of-life options. When the former Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was debated in the House, I spoke about palliative care and the need to educate Canadians about it as an end-of-life option. I was pleased the Senate amended our original bill to include palliative care in the legislation. Our government has worked collaboratively with partners, including the provinces and territories, to develop a framework on palliative care. We are implementing a targeted action plan of providing $6 billion directly to provinces and territories to better support home and community care, including palliative care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289257">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the important Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. We need to know its origins to understand why we are at this point today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289258">In 2016, working on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was a rather difficult exercise given that the Liberal government was intent on bulldozing it through. I believe that is the right expression, because the government refused all amendments proposed by the different opposition parties, including the Conservative Party, the NDP and the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289259">The government put pressure on the Senate by giving it a deadline. The Senate wanted to improve the bill before the House voted on it. What was the end result? In September 2019, the Superior Court pointed out that the bill passed by the House was not adequate, especially with respect to the issue of the foreseeability of the date of the person's death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289260">That is where we find ourselves today. We are in the House debating an extremely sensitive subject, but we have not had much time to consult the experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289261">Everyone has a different perspective on the issue, whether they are members of the House or members of the public in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289262"> I wrote a speech, but I have decided not to read it. Instead, I would like to share my own experience with my colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289263">The vote on Bill C-14 was the hardest vote I cast in my first four years in Ottawa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289264">On the one hand, I had some constituents asking me to vote in favour of the bill, while others wanted me to make sure that the legislation would protect the most vulnerable and honour the conscientious objection rights of medical practitioners. On the other hand, I had constituents going through a very difficult time with a loved one who was suffering and could not access MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289265">I did not sleep well the night before the vote. I knew that no matter which position I took, whatever I said in the House could be interpreted by the media and by Canadians. Allow me to explain. Some members voted against Bill C-14, and I would imagine that others will vote against Bill C-7. Members voting against the bill are doing so not because they are against it, but because they do not think it goes far enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289266">The opposite is also true. Some members voted in favour of Bill C-14 in 2016 because they wanted to make sure people got the bare minimum. No matter which side we took, we had to explain something extremely sensitive, and I do not think a simple yes or no could accomplish that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289267">I often ask myself, who am I to decide for someone else? As lawmakers, it is our duty to protect the most vulnerable, especially if we remove the criterion of reasonably foreseeable natural death for access to MAID. This is reflected in the questions that some members have been asking in the House. I am sure it reflects the opinion of many Canadians who wonder what would happen if a person wanted to give advance written consent in case their situation changed over time. There is much more to this debate, and I do not think we are done talking about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289268">Madam Speaker, I forgot to tell you that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252814" Type="2">Calgary Signal Hill</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289269">I am very concerned about ensuring that this bill enables all Canadians, wherever they may live in this country, to have access to the appropriate resources to make the right decision for their situation. The current pandemic has exposed the weaknesses in our health care systems. I doubt all Canadians in rural areas have access to specialists who can guide them and give them the right information so that they can make a decision based on their circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289270">I am also very concerned about minors and vulnerable people. During the study of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in 2016, I had the opportunity to hear the testimony of two witnesses who had suffered accidents and endured the most traumatic ordeals a human being can experience. They told me that, had they had access to MAID back then, they probably would not have been talking to me that day because they had been in such a dark place at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289271">I know people who were there for the final moments when someone who was suffering asked for MAID. I am certainly concerned about all that, and it makes me wonder what the best solution is. Is it because we do not have the necessary palliative care resources? Is it because both the federal and provincial governments and health care facilities are making poor decisions? I am wondering about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289272">I must say, I feel like we are rushing the process today, because has been quite a while since the courts asked Parliament to modernize this legislation after what happened in Quebec. This is a government that shut down Parliament under the pretext of being in a pandemic, as though we could not do more than one thing at a time. There are 338 MPs. Committees could have continued to sit. We could have heard from experts who could have explained this issue to us properly so we could make the right decision, the best decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289273">Again, this is something that will not be easy for many of us. We have differing opinions within our party and elsewhere. However, I would like to note that I am proud of my party for letting me vote freely. I want to thank my leader for allowing this, without any pressure from my organization. I hope that all political parties will offer this choice, because this is a vote of conscience, and it is challenging for us to represent our constituents, who do not all share the same opinion. We also have our own conscience. For some, this is a matter of religion or beliefs, which means we may not all see eye to eye on this file. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289274">Personally, the thing I wrestle with the most is wondering who I am to decide what is best for someone who is suffering. I believe that is what will guide my decision on the day of the vote. I hope that I will be able to make the right decision and that all of us can then work with the government to put all the necessary resources in place to properly inform and educate the public, and provide everything we can to vulnerable people who are going through tough times with loved ones, so that they are adequately supported in making the best decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289275">In closing, I hope that next time, we will have more time to talk about people who are not vulnerable, sick or about to die, but still want to express advance consent.</ParaText>

Yesterday, October 18, marked the first anniversary of the passing of my aunt Claire, who chose to access medical assistance in dying.

I feel very honoured to participate in this debate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289294">We are doing so because the Supreme Court deemed certain provisions of the original medical assistance in dying legislation, MAID, to be unconstitutional. That provision, deeming death must be reasonably foreseeable, is being withdrawn in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. The second important piece of this bill is the removal of the 10-day waiting period. In my remarks today, I want to address both of those changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289295">First, I would like to state at the outset that I support the bill. In contrast to some others who have spoken, I do not believe the government should have appealed the Supreme Court decision. While I commend the government for finally bringing forward this legislation, it is unfortunate that the Liberals are only acting when being made to do so by the courts. This is somewhat of a repeat of four years ago when the government was forced by the courts to introduce the original MAID legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289296"> Those suffering near the end of life should not have to resort to the courts before government acts. I guess one could say, however, that late is better than never, and it is certainly better than endless appeals of the decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289297">Four years ago when the original bill was introduced in the House, I made a special effort to obtain the collective views of my constituents. While I personally supported the original legislation, I also wanted my vote to reflect the feelings of my constituents. I reached out extensively to survey my constituents through phone calls, emails, Facebook and direct mail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289298">The responses at that time were from all age brackets and all demographics. The end result was 77% of several thousand respondents supported the legislation. Ironically, that number is awfully close to the percentage of support I received in the general election just one year ago. I am confident that a similar survey today would yield the same results, and the majority of my constituents would be supportive of the changes being proposed in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289299">What I heard from constituents reflected my own personal views. While I respect some deeply held views from constituents who do not support MAID, I am of the belief that I, and only I, should determine how much pain and suffering is reasonable for me when end of life is near. I do not believe any institution or government should deny me my constitutional right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289300">Some medical professionals do not support MAID, and that is their constitutional prerogative. Those advocating against these changes feel those rights are not adequately protected in the legislation. That may be legally correct, but medical professionals not wanting to administer MAID clearly have a professional responsibility to refer patients. In Alberta, the website for Alberta Health Services has a listing of doctors who are willing to perform MAID. If it is the view of a medical professional that he or she is not prepared to perform MAID, they can make a referral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289301">The second important piece of this bill is removing the 10-day waiting period. I also support this. The contention that someone who is suffering to the extent that they ask for MAID one day will simply wake up a few days later and change their mind, I do not agree with. In my view all the 10-day period provided for was additional suffering and an opportunity, for those who oppose MAID on fundamental principles, to try to change the patient's mind. In my view, both are wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289302">I am sure most MPs are receiving the same emails I am getting, many from constituents asking that I support the legislation and others who are opposed. I have no issue with those opposed to MAID. Where I do take issue is with some of the rationales that are being used. Medical professionals' conscience rights is one, and I have spoken to that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289303">Others claim the legislation would take us down the slippery slope of other countries, where euthanasia is available to children and those with mental illness. Clearly those are red herrings because this legislation would do none of that. Others are asking for more study, another delay tactic, similar to appealing the court decisions. It is more work for lawyers, less satisfaction for those suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289304">Increased funding for palliative care has also been raised as an option by those opposing this legislation. Enhancing palliative care is always welcome, but in my view is not directly related to this issue. We are talking here about people wanting to end excruciating pain and suffering. These people are not asking for their pain and suffering to be made more comfortable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289305">Our health care system must do both things well. It must allow for people to live with dignity and receive excellent care as they reach the end of their lives. In addition, the provision of health care is a provincial responsibility, and I do not believe it should be part of this discussion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289306">Since the original MAID legislation was passed four years ago, I have taken a special interest in this issue. Unlike some other members who spoke earlier, I have not attended a death where someone has chosen MAID. However, I have had dozens of constituents make a real effort to tell me they experienced MAID with a loved one and that it was very special and appropriate. They personally thanked me, as someone charged with making laws in this country, for making this provision available at end of life for their loved one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289307">I have not had one constituent call me to say how bad this experience was. In almost all cases, these same constituents have said that society needs to go further. In fact, many constituents seem to believe advance consent already exists. They cannot believe they are not allowed to prepare a legal document, while of sound mind, that would provide their loved ones with guidance in the event they are nearing their end of life but are no longer of sound mind. For that reason, it is critical the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> get on with his public consultation on a broader review of MAID, which was promised some time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289308">The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> needs to find out what Canadians want and not make those suffering take years to go through the court system to get change. Like most things, the Liberals blame COVID. However, there are many ways of seeking input from the public regarding other changes to MAID, and the minister needs to get this discussion moving now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289309">In summary, I look forward to the bill being studied in committee. I know there will be those opposed to the bill and those in favour making presentations, and all need to be heard. For me personally, I have consulted and listened to my constituents and feel very comfortable voting in favour of the legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289315">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253079" Type="2">Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289316">It is with great emotion that I rise in the House to speak to the bill on medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289317">First, this bill is the result of a decision handed down by the Superior Court of Quebec. I am very familiar with that court. I had the great honour and responsibility of arguing cases before it in my previous life. Barreau du Québec lawyers have the privilege of working with one of the best courts in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289318">This court rendered a decision and rather than appealing it, the Liberal government said yes. Quebec will once again be leading the way for the rest of the country. Our progressive and forward-looking Quebec will guide Canada. That makes me proud both as a lawyer and a federal government MP from Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289319">The purpose of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is to ensure that people like Ms. Gladu and Mr. Truchon have the same rights, opportunities and freedoms as those who are facing an imminent or reasonably foreseeable death.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289320">The ruling in Truchon found the eligibility criteria of reasonably foreseeable natural death to be unconstitutional. Our government also agrees that MAID should be available to relieve suffering and pain from serious medical conditions and is now proposing through this legislation to amend the Criminal Code so that Canadians can end their lives with medical assistance if that is the right choice for them. To accomplish this, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes to repeal the requirement that natural death be reasonably foreseeable, opening up access to those who are suffering in a wider set of circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289321">The changes to the legislation propose to create two pathways in terms of the procedures that must be followed to assess a request for medical assistance in dying. While I do not have time to get into the details of the two regimes in full, there are a number of points that I wish to highlight today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289322">For those people who are suffering intolerably from a serious medical condition, but whose death is not reasonably foreseeable, the safeguards put in place emphasize the importance of ensuring that sufficient time is taken to evaluate the request. A minimum of 90 days will be needed so that the person can be assessed by a doctor who has some experience with this condition, which will help to ensure that the person gets all of the information, services and tools that might help them improve their quality of life.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289323">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> also creates new safeguards with respect to consent. Individuals requesting an assessment for medical assistance in dying give their consent, of course. Clearly, they also give their consent to receive MAID when they officially sign their request. However, what matters most is consent when MAID is about to be administered. There must be no doubt as to the person's desire to receive MAID at the moment they receive it. Doctors will be more comfortable proceeding under those circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289324">Depending on their illness, some individuals risk losing their capacity to give consent between the time they are approved for MAID and the day they would like to receive it. Although we expect that most people are ready for MAID rather quickly once their request is approved, some people may wish to wait for a specific event such as a child's wedding or the birth of a grandchild. Those who wish to wait before going ahead with MAID are caught in an impossible situation if there is the risk of losing capacity. Either they wait for their special family event and risk losing their ability to die as they wish, or they move up the date of the intervention and miss a very important moment with their family and friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289325">Therefore, this bill will enable individuals in real danger of losing their capacity to consent prior to the day specified for administration of MAID to make special arrangements with their practitioner. Such arrangements must be made in writing. The doctor and the individual must work together to come to an agreement that works for both of them. This safeguard is important for individuals as well as for doctors because they are the ones who bear the tremendous burden of ending someone's life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289326">The bill addresses another difficult situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289327">Let us suppose that, when the day comes, the person has lost their capacity to consent to MAID, but remains conscious and alert, although not competent. Let us also suppose that they act in such a way or make gestures clearly indicating that they do not want to receive MAID. The bill addresses this situation—which we obviously hope will be rare—by clearly stating that the physician must not proceed because, in this case, it is no longer what the person wants.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6289328">The concept of freedom of choice, for me, remains central to all of this. I watched my grandmother suffer from Alzheimer's. Not long after I was born she was diagnosed, and when I was very young she used to repeat the same stories over and over again to me, about her own life and the life lessons that she wanted to pass on. She would tell me about how she used to work two and then three jobs, taking shifts overnight in order to buy her family's first home and provide a better life for her children. What that repetition instilled in me was certainly an understanding that my grandmother was probably the strongest woman I knew, that she was a force of nature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289329">When I was about seven or eight she forgot who I was, she forgot who everybody was, and I had to very painfully remind her every time I saw her. By the time I was 10 she no longer remembered language at all, and it was just humming, which I still somehow found very soothing, comforting and somehow okay. The degradation from there continued; her eyes no longer opened at all, she was in a wheelchair, the humming had completely stopped and when I was 15 the only muscles that worked were reflexive ones. Even if nothing else in her body moved, she would chew food if it was put into her mouth. It took two people to move her from her wheelchair to her bed or to change her, and this situation went on like this for 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289330">As a teenager I used to wonder constantly what it would feel like to be trapped in a body like that, wondering if that was really the same strong woman in there or not. It was 10 years of listening to hushed voices in the kitchen saying, “...but there's nothing we can do.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289331">I do not know for sure, of course, what my grandmother would have decided for herself, but I do know for sure what I would want. For those who would decide something different for themselves, or for whom their beliefs are contrary to assisted dying, this framework provides everyone with the freedom to decide for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289332">It is not a crime under the Criminal Code to take one's own life. It is a crime to take someone else's. The changes proposed would ensure that those people who need and who would like doctors to help them in order to end their life with dignity, at the time that they choose, can do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289333">MAID is certainly one of the most challenging social issues in our society, which is made up of people with very diverse viewpoints and needs. I believe that this bill would achieve the right balance between the freedoms and rights of those who are dying and who are seeking a peaceful medically assisted death and our medical practitioners who need a clear framework for timing and consent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289352">Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to be able to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which seeks to amend Canada's medical assistance in dying legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289353">This is officially one of the hardest decisions I have had to make since entering politics, first at the municipal level in 2009 and then at the federal level. I never used to get my family involved in my decision-making. However, on this issue, I decided to get my wife and adult daughters to sit down with me at the kitchen table for a frank and serious family discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289354">Our government has been working on this bill since 2019. We have had discussions about the future and the choices that we need to make as parents. These discussions were extremely difficult. I know that this is an issue that hits very close to home for Canadians, but we do not talk about it in public very much. However, medical assistance in dying is a very complex and very serious issue for me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289355">Yesterday, when I came back from my run, a neighbour was waiting on my doorstep. We had an intense discussion, a very good discussion, on medical assistance in dying. He had just been diagnosed with ALS and was very emotional, which made me very emotional. He asked me if I had voted for or against the bill the last time. Because I understood that an individual's right to choose is very important, I voted in favour of the bill. This time too, I agree with the amendments proposed by the Quebec courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289356">I have deviated somewhat from my speech, but events like these give us an opportunity to reflect on the reasons we are here. This subject has not been talked about very much in the House, and some opposition members have asked why it is up to all of us here to make these decisions. It just so happens that we chose to be decision-makers and that sometimes we have to make tough choices like this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289357">We immediately embarked on an inclusive process with the provinces and territories in response to recent court rulings about MAID rules. We held extensive consultations. We talked to doctors, organizations, vulnerable people and eligible individuals. The consultations were part of our government's progressive approach to ensuring that the federal framework reflects evolving views and Canadians' needs. That is how we always make decisions here in the House. Our goal is always to improve Canadians' lives and be as fair as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289358">We were particularly focused on making sure that people with disabilities could express their views on the subject. People with disabilities are extremely important to me, given my past experience as parliamentary secretary to the minister responsible for persons with disabilities. That was an incredible experience, and we drafted the first accessibility act, which is near and dear to my heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289359">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> would amend the Criminal Code provisions respecting medical assistance in dying to provide greater autonomy and freedom of choice to eligible individuals seeking medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289360">Protecting vulnerable individuals and respecting the right of people with disabilities to equality and dignity are essential considerations. More specifically, this bill would broaden medical assistance in dying to people with irremediable medical conditions who are in an irreversible decline but are not at the end of life.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289361">The bill also proposes excluding persons whose sole underlying condition is a mental illness, introducing a host of safeguards for persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable while maintaining and relaxing existing safeguards for persons whose death is reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289362">The bill also proposes permitting persons whose death is reasonably foreseeable and who were deemed eligible for medical assistance in dying to provide consent in advance of the time of the procedure even if they lose the capacity to consent prior to the day specified in the arrangement with the medical practitioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289363">Supporting and advancing disability inclusion is not new for our government. From day one, we have been committed to achieving these objectives and have improved our programs to better respond to the needs of persons with disabilities. It should be noted that the Government of Canada fully respects the equality rights of Canadians with disabilities. That is why we have been working hard since 2015 to advance the accessibility and inclusion of persons with disabilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289364">For example, in 2018, we acceded to the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This means that Canadians have additional recourse for filing a complaint with the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities if they believe their rights under the convention have been violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289365">In July 2019, we passed the Accessible Canada Act, which we are in the process of bringing into force. This legislation is considered one of the most important advances in federal legislation on human rights for persons with disabilities in more than 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289366">In 2019, we also launched the accessibility strategy for the public service of Canada, in order to make the public service more accessible and inclusive. In addition, we improved data collection, in particular regarding indigenous people with disabilities. We recognize that integrating people with disabilities is about more than simply passing a law, and we are working with these people and other stakeholders to combat stigmas and prejudices. The culture needs to change so that the significant contributions made by Canadians with disabilities are recognized and valued as much as those of other Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289367">Bill C-7 gives vulnerable people new, concrete safeguards against pressure and coercion, to ensure that MAID remains an informed, voluntary decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289368">Today, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Seniors, I see that this has once again become a hot topic in my riding and in our discussions. I see how important it is to give people the right to make their own end-of-life choices. Fundamentally, we hope to strike a fair balance between respecting the individual autonomy of people who request MAID and protecting vulnerable people. We want this measure to be as compassionate as possible.</ParaText>

However, we must not overlook the caring presence of the social workers who support these individuals throughout the process, allowing them, as my colleague said, to make an informed decision and fully and knowingly consent. The presence of a social worker is an important part of the support provided to individuals and families, as this decision is often made as a family.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289389">I am speaking here in the House of Commons today about Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code with respect to medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289390">Many people here have had unique experiences involving the end of a loved one’s life. Personally, my most recent experience was last year, when I held my father-in-law’s hand until we were sure that he could die without suffering. I realized then that not everyone is that lucky. I thought about my grandmother, who fought a long and painful battle with cancer for many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289391">Naturally, as the Bloc Québécois critic for the status of women and seniors, I was contacted by a number of groups about this bill. I will therefore recap all of the work my party did on this important issue, while emphasizing the great sensitivity of Quebeckers when it comes to medical assistance in dying. I will conclude with the position of some seniors’ and women’s groups who have made extremely useful recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289392">First, let us talk about the reason for this debate. In September 2019, the Superior Court of Quebec ruled in favour of Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon, both suffering from incurable degenerative diseases, stating that one of the eligibility criteria for medical assistance in dying was too restrictive, both in the federal legislation covering MAID and in Quebec’s act respecting end-of-life care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289393">Two brave individuals, and I know people who knew them personally, simply asked to be able to die with dignity, without uselessly prolonging their pain. Suffering from cerebral palsy, Mr. Truchon lost the use of all four limbs and had difficulty speaking. Pain killers are no longer working for Ms. Gladu, who suffers from post polio syndrome, and she cannot remain in one position very long because of the constant pain. She said that she loves life too much to settle for mere existence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289394">What we are talking about here is the “reasonable foreseeability of natural death” requirement. Justice Christine Baudouin said it well in her ruling when she wrote that “The court has no hesitation in concluding that the reasonably foreseeable natural death requirement infringes Mr. Truchon and Mrs. Gladu's rights to liberty and security, protected by section 7 of the Charter.” That is the crux of this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289395">The defendants were challenging the fact that they had been denied access to medical assistance in dying because their death was not reasonably foreseeable, even though they had legitimately demonstrated their desire to stop suffering. Jean Truchon had chosen to die in June 2020, but he moved up the date of his death as a result the pandemic. Nicole Gladu is still living, and I commend her courage and determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289396">The Bloc Québécois' position on this ethical question is clear. I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252689" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation> for his excellent work and co-operation on this matter. I remind members that, as many have already pointed out, legislators did not do their job properly with Bill C-14. As a result, issues of a social and political nature are being brought before the courts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289397">We need to make sure that people who have serious, irreversible illnesses are not forced to go to court to access MAID. Do we really want to inflict more suffering on people who are already suffering greatly by forcing them to go to court for the right to make the very personal decision about their end of life? This will inevitably happen if we cannot figure out a way to cover cognitive degenerative diseases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289398">Obviously, we agree that we need to proceed with caution before including mental health issues, but that is not the issue today. The exclusion from the bill of eligibility for medical assistance in dying for individuals suffering solely from a mental illness requires further reflection, study and consultation, which will be completed at the Standing Committee on Health as soon as the motion that has already been moved by my colleague from Montcalm is adopted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289399">I would like to remind members of the important role Quebec played on this issue. Quebec was the first jurisdiction in Canada to pass legislation on this issue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289400">Wanda Morris, a representative of a B.C. group that advocates for the right to die with dignity, pointed out that the committee studying the issue had the unanimous support of all the parties in the National Assembly. This should be a model for the rest of Canada. Ms. Morris said she felt confident after seeing how it would work in Quebec and seeing that people were pleased to have the option of dying with dignity. The Quebec legislation, which was spearheaded by Véronique Hivon, was the result of years of research and consultation with physicians, ethicists, patients and the public. It has been reported that 79% of Quebeckers support medical assistance in dying, compared to 68% in the rest of Canada. That is important to point out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289430">Madam Speaker, no one likes to talk about death. It reminds us that we are mortal, as are the people we love and the people we are emotionally attached to. We do not like to feel negative emotions. Our brain reacts negatively to these emotions by releasing hormones that make us panic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289431">Death is such a difficult subject that most people worry when a loved one starts talking about wills, last wishes or funeral plans. They worry about the person’s health, when that person is only trying to plan for the future. This may sound ghoulish, but life always ends in death. Our entire lives are planned, starting with our parents planning our education and then us planning our careers, moves, children, and so on. We can plan for death and funeral arrangements the same way, even if we do not have suicidal tendencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289432">For there to be death, there has to have been life. We have a short time on this planet, so we need to act responsibly, not only for ourselves, but also for the generations to come. We are only borrowing this planet. The place where we live is temporary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289433">I listened to my colleagues’ arguments last week, and I also read a lot about medical assistance in dying. I even discussed it with my father. I love my father. I hope that he will be with us for a very long time. I am a daddy’s girl. Unfortunately, my father’s wishes are currently impossible. He told me that, if he were to be diagnosed with a degenerative disease and told what was going to happen, he would like to be able to tell his doctor, at a certain point in the progression of the disease, that he wanted medical assistance in dying and that he did not want to linger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289434">For now, that is impossible. It is something to think about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289435">Even if these discussions about our loved ones’ final moments are difficult, we need to have them. They are important. They ensure that we can respect the person’s wishes to the very end. It does not mean that the person will necessarily opt for medical assistance in dying. It means that we will know what the person really wants at the end. It can also prevent families from being torn apart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289436">One of the points raised by my colleagues was the fear expressed by several disability advocacy organizations that people with disabilities will be urged to get medical assistance in dying. I must admit that I, too, was concerned before I read the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289437">Once I read the bill, I saw that the request for medical assistance in dying must be made in writing by the person in question, and that it can be withdrawn at any time. When the substance is being administered, if the person gestures or speaks in a way that appears to be expressing a change of heart, everything stops there. That is the case not only for people with disabilities, but also for people whose death is foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289438">The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that people with disabilities have the same rights as people without disabilities. This implies that they have the right to life, and that they are entitled to receive the treatments appropriate to their condition. Why would they not also have the right to medical assistance in dying if they meet the criteria clearly indicated in the bill? Do people with disabilities not have the right to decide for themselves simply because they have a disability? I find that unacceptable. I reject the idea. People with disabilities are capable of making their own decisions. They are rational beings. This has nothing to do with making decisions for other people.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289439">It has to do with allowing people the right to make their own decisions concerning their own death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289440">I would add that other safeguards have been put in place, namely the three-month wait time with support services. My colleagues talked about that. It is not always easy to get in touch with a doctor or social worker, for example. I used to live in the regions. My doctor was a general practitioner. However, I do not think anyone ever had a better doctor because, when the time came to pick up the phone and call a specialist, he was the first to do so. Nothing could stop him. I wish everyone had that kind of doctor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289441">All of this makes me think that people with disabilities are not at risk. They will decide for themselves, they will have the same rights and responsibilities as people who do not have disabilities and for whom death is foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289442">I read that people are concerned that doctors will suggest medical assistance in dying based simply on a person’s disability. The very idea is repulsive, since doctors would not encourage patients to die. They would first try to relieve their pain and make suggestions for how to live with their condition. Beyond that, according to the bill, it is not up to the doctor to decide, but the patient. Doctors assess the situation and the request. Their role is not to suggest but to inform. It is the patient’s role to request and suggest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289443">I also read that some people believe that opening up medical assistance in dying to people with disabilities might suggest that their lives are not worth living. I have read and re-read the bill, and nowhere does it say that the life of a person with a disability is not worth living. Did anyone here tell Stephen Hawking that his life was not worth living? Did anyone tell any of our Paralympic athletes that their life was not worth living?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289444">I am getting worked up because I have a little cousin who suffers from severe cerebral palsy. She barely speaks, but when she wants something, she knows how to make herself clear. She will never be able to request medical assistance in dying. Given her personality, I am convinced that, even if she could speak, she would not request it, because she is a ray of sunshine, because she is the person in our family who always believes that everything is good, everything is right and, at the end of the day, we can get through whatever life throws at us. I love her. She makes us see the beauty of laughter and closeness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289445">Although her life is complicated, it is certainly worth living. Therefore, saying that the bill is suggesting that the lives of people with disabilities are not worth living is yet another despicable point that was made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289446">The bill’s preamble states that life and the dignity of seniors and people with disabilities must be respected and that suicide must be prevented. I agree. To deny people with disabilities who are capable of making the choice the right to decide whether to receive medical assistance in dying is to deny them their dignity. Are we prepared to do that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289447">That amounts to treating these people as if they were less important, as if they were incapable of making decisions because of their disability. The very idea is repulsive to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289448">Not everyone with a disability will request medical assistance in dying, just as not everyone without a disability will request it. Medical assistance in dying is an exceptional measure. It is not the rule. It is a choice that is fundamentally personal and that should not in any way be imposed by another person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289449">Some called in particular for the withdrawal of the 10-day wait period for people whose death is foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289450">Once again, I have very personal reasons for supporting that withdrawal.</ParaText>

She told me about the vibrant man John was, with a big heart, a successful career and an impressive education.

As John's illness progressed, he was moved into a long-term care facility where he spent the rest of his life. It was there that she saw so many others who were unable to be independent. She was saddened to see there was no dignity for these people, or for her husband John, as they were no longer able to look after their own personal needs. I saw this myself with my mother as she went through care in her last 10 years of life. The story of my constituent was one that conveys the importance of providing a diverse end-of-life option for Canadians that will help them provide the right decisions to be able to end their days with dignity, comfort and peace of mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289472">Of course, there are two sides to this debate. I have heard from other people and received a lot of feedback that they understand we are coming at this as a deeply personal and sensitive topic for everyone, but are concerned these new amendments may impact the disability community, something we have discussed in the debate today, and the conscience rights of medical practitioners or our work toward improving palliative care. They all really do stitch together. While I am sympathetic to these concerns, I am also pleased to see our new legislation strikes the right balance of autonomy and protection of vulnerable people. This is thanks to many disability advocates who have participated actively throughout the consultation process, including specific round tables that focused on issues faced by the disability community. As was mentioned earlier in the debate, 300,000 people had input throughout the month of January 2020 to help us get to where we are today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289473">Additionally, our law specifically acknowledges the conscience rights of health care providers and the role they play in providing medical assistance in dying. These new amendments do not make changes to these rights and I know we will continue to work with provinces and territories to support access to medical assistance in dying while also respecting the personal convictions of health care providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289474">However, the most common concern I have heard from my constituents is the need to prioritize palliative care over medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289475">It is really the end-of-life care that we are talking about in both cases. In palliative care, Canadians are approaching the end of their life, and they deserve to receive care in the setting of their choice and to live out their days in comfort and dignity. They also deserve the freedom to make this fundamental decision about life and death without fear of their personal choice being obstructed by politics or government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289476">In Guelph, we are very blessed to have a wonderful palliative care facility that has been growing over the years as people recognize this as an option towards the end-of-life care that they are looking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289477"> However, 70% of Canadians are left without access to adequate palliative care. We have the responsibility to act in the interests of patients and their families, which is why our government supports access to both palliative care and medical assistance in dying. End-of-life issues are as diverse as Canadians themselves, and these issues also change throughout the course of medical needs and procedures that are available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289478"> It is our responsibility as a government to provide as many options as possible for Canadians, so that they can take these deeply personal choices and make them on their own. That is why our government has worked collaboratively with partners, such as the provinces and territories, to develop a framework on palliative care. To support this framework, our government is implementing a targeted action plan that will help to improve access to palliative care for underserved populations; support families, health care providers and communities; and look at the funding that is needed to be able to execute our plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289479">I would like to take this opportunity to thank Hospice Wellington and its executive director, Pat Stuart for the amazing work they do to support our most vulnerable citizens, including through palliative care.</ParaText>

I look forward to continuing to engage with my colleagues on this important subject and with my constituents, so that we can work to create a system that is responsive to the needs of patients, and creates an environment that can create comfort and reassurance for patients and their families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289522">Let us recognize all women's contributions and celebrate every woman pioneer, trailblazer and rule-breaker who fought to take her rightful place, who fought for each hard-won right and who continues to fight for a better today and tomorrow.

However, the threat is real. Whether it is about Huawei, the illegal detention of the two Michaels or the aggressive statement by the Chinese ambassador regarding people fleeing Hong Kong, the Prime Minister does nothing. Worse yet, he said he admired the Chinese dictatorship. It is not surprising, then, that the Prime Minister is using Canadians' money to support infrastructure projects in China instead of promoting projects here in Canada. </ParaText>

Because of the pandemic, traditional festivities had to be changed, but the warmth, generosity and love inspired by George was abundantly clear. A classic car tribute five blocks long had been organized by his loved ones, while the drivers honked a happy birthday.</ParaText>

He was also part of the home child program, where orphaned and impoverished children from the U.K. were sent to Canada. As we know now, the children were often used as cheap labour on farms and in private homes. The 115,000 home children who came to Canada, like George, have given so much to their adopted country.</ParaText>

We became so because of the oil revenues and royalties, and the many thousands of workers and their families earning good incomes and living better lives because of it. It also meant that we no longer qualified or required payments under the equalization, the constitutionally mandated program to address inequities between the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289538">However, equalization does not help the sharp dip in revenues experienced by oil producing provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta and Saskatchewan recently exacerbated by the downturn in markets due to the pandemic. The fiscal stabilization program is aimed at that, but it needs to be retooled and upgraded with funding sufficient to address the serious financial crisis facing these provinces.</ParaText>

Last week, the Chinese ambassador threatened 300,000 Canadians currently living in Hong Kong. He has offered no public apology and the government has not demanded one. This morning, we learned that the Chinese government has doubled down and is complaining about our reaction to its threat.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289820">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to discuss Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code in relation to medical assistance in dying, or MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289821">As a physician, I took a keen interest when Parliament passed federal legislation in June 2016 to allow eligible Canadian adults to request medical assistance in dying. This was subsequent to the February 2015 Supreme Court of Canada ruling that parts of the Criminal Code would need to change to satisfy the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289822">At the time, I was also a member of the provincial parliament in Ontario and was involved in how that province would ensure people would have their personal choice of access to medical assistance in dying, while also ensuring the conscience rights of health care providers would be respected. The actual implementation of MAID was our responsibility and was very carefully considered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289823">Working with provincial organizations like the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, we established policies to ensure that, should physicians have conscientious objections to administering MAID, systems were in place to provide appropriate care options to the patient. Consistent with the expectations set out in the college's professional obligations and human rights policy, physicians who decline to provide MAID due to a conscientious objection must do so in a manner that respects patient dignity and must not impede access to MAID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289824">They must communicate their objection to the patient directly and with sensitivity, informing the patient that the objection is due to personal and not clinical reasons. They must not express personal moral judgments about the beliefs, lifestyle, identity or characteristics of the patient. They must provide the patient with information about all options for care that may be available or appropriate to meet their clinical needs, concerns and/or wishes, and they must not withhold information about the existence of any procedure or treatment because it conflicts with their conscience or religious beliefs. They must not abandon the patient and must provide the patient with an effective referral. Physicians must make the effective referral in a timely manner and must not expose patients to adverse clinical outcomes due to a delay in making the effective referral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289825">While there is importance in ensuring widespread access to MAID, the law specifically acknowledges the conscience rights of health care providers and the role they may play in providing medical assistance in dying. As a physician who spent all of my time in clinical practice doing my best to preserve life, I feel this balance is working well, and the amendments proposed in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> do not make any changes to any of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289826">As a government, we remain committed to working with provinces and territories to support access to medical assistance in dying while respecting the personal convictions of health care providers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289827">What are the amendments that Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289828">In response to the Superior Court of Quebec's Truchon decision, it repeals the MAID eligibility criterion that applies when a person's natural death is reasonably foreseeable. The criterion is the 10-day reflection period. One concern at the forefront is to ensure that measures are in place that provide safeguards for the MAID process. I believe Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> does precisely this. It proposes to create two sets of safeguards that must be respected before MAID is provided. For persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable, the existing safeguards, as amended by Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, would continue to apply. For persons whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable, the existing safeguards with additional safeguards would apply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289829">I think we are all aware of the concern about increased risks where MAID is provided to persons who are not dying in the short term. That is why additional safeguards would apply where a person's natural death is not reasonably foreseeable. With these new safeguards, specific attention with respect to both time and expertise would be devoted to assessing requests for MAID and to ensuring those making the request are made aware of and seriously consider all other available means of relieving their suffering, including palliative care. In nearly half of the reported MAID deaths in Canada to date, the practitioner providing MAID had in fact consulted with at least one other health care professional in addition to the required second opinion from another practitioner. There is no question these practitioners are taking their responsibilities very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289830"> For those whose death is reasonably foreseeable, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> most importantly proposes to eliminate the 10-day reflection period, which many practitioners say can prolong unbearable suffering.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289831">The proposed amendments of the bill will allow waiver of final consent for persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable, who have been assessed and approved to receive MAID and who have made an arrangement with their practitioners for waiver of final consent because they are at risk of losing decision-making capacity before their chosen date to receive MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289832">We have heard many touching stories during the course of debate on this bill and situations like that of Audrey Parker, who chose to access MAID on November 1, 2018, despite her desire to see Christmas with her family. She feared that she would lose her capacity to give full consent before Christmas and so she requested MAID before then. Considering her case, we see the need for this amendment in real human terms.

              <ParaText id="6289853">Madam Speaker, it really amazes me how quickly we have gotten here. The 2015 election was five years ago today. One of the first issues we dealt with in that Parliament was a new law that legalized euthanasia. The government came up with a new term for it, calling it medical assistance in dying. At that time, the then minister of health and the then minister of justice said that it was a finely tuned balance where there was the right mix of safeguards and opportunities. Of course, as a result of the SNC-Lavalin scandal, both of those ministers were kicked out of the Liberal cabinet and the Liberal Party, but they along with their colleagues said that this was a necessary balance that was struck. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289854">What was built into the process as well was a legislative review five years later. However, the government jumped the gun on that legislative review. It said that before the legislative review, it would remove some of the safeguards that were thought to be vital less than four years ago and would do that ahead of any review. The fig leaf the government used to do that was the Truchon decision in Quebec. This decision dealt with a very specific issue, the question of reasonable foreseeability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289855">It was a political choice for the government not to appeal that decision because it did not want to. It wanted to be able to justify, ahead of the timeline set by the legislative review, moving forward with the removal of safeguards that it had said quite recently were vital. Then it packed into the legislation a number of critical changes that had absolutely nothing to do with the content of the Truchon decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289856">My colleagues have spoken eloquently about the specific issues around removing reasonable foreseeability and the concerns raised by people in the disability community. I want to focus on the aspects of this legislation that have absolutely nothing to do with the court decision to which it is supposedly responding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289857">This legislation will bring us, for the first time, three things about which Canadians should be very concerned. First, it will bring us same-day death, the opportunity to receive death on the same day a person requests it. Second, it will bring us death without contemporaneous consent. It will bring us a situation where people will have their lives taken without being consulted in the moment. Third, it will bring death without the presence of independent witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289858">I am opposed on all three counts. I do not think we should have same-day death. I do not think we should have death without contemporaneous consent or any kind of contemporaneous consultation. I do not think we should have death without independent witnesses present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289859">Let us talk about same-day death. Right now there is a 10-day reflection period. Let us be very clear that the law already allows that reflection period to be waived in certain circumstances. The waiving of that reflection period is not a long, arduous process. If the physicians involved say that because of the particular circumstances in this case that the 10-day reflection period should be waived, that 10-day reflection period can be waived, but it is a default. It says that on balance, except in exceptional circumstances, the 10-day reflection period between when a person requests death and receives it is a reasonable frame of time. I think we can all understand that people who are going through challenging circumstances and major changes in their lives will feel intense feelings of pain, suffering and angst in a moment. Those are real sincere feelings, but they might feel differently in a different space with a little time and opportunity for reflection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289860">I would like us to be the kind of country where if people say that they have had enough and that they want to die, instead of being told okay, let us do it right now, they are told that we have this mechanism of review of consideration, take that time and even that review process can be waived. That is eminently reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289861">What we do not want in the country is a situation where I might go visit an elderly relative on Wednesday and seems totally fine. Then I come back on Friday and find that the person requested death yesterday and received death on the same day. We should leave in place a default of a 10-day reflection period. It is not only members on this side of the House who feel that way. I raised the question during questions and comments before prorogation. Even the member for <Affiliation DbId="253142" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation> said that he supported leaving in place the 10-day reflection period.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289862">I know other Liberals believe this as well, and I would challenge them to do the right thing and recognize the need for this amendment to remove same-day death. It just is not safe. It is dangerous. It is rife with abuse. It does not allow people the time and space to consider carefully in consultation with family members. The 10-day reflection period can be waived, but it is an important default to have in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289863">Secondly, we have a proposal on this legislation, and it has nothing to do with the Truchon decision, for death without contemporaneous consent. What this means is that a person could say in advance, “I want you to take my life on December 31, and if I don't have capacity then go ahead and take my life anyway.” There is no requirement in this legislation, on that future date set, for there to be any kind of consultation with the patient. In other words, a person, in whatever state of mind, could not even be told. They could have something slipped in their coffee without being told in advance. They could have their life taken without being asked in the moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289864">Members are giving me looks. They should look at the legislation. There is no requirement in the legislation for the patient to be told what is happening while it is happening. I would, at a minimum, propose we amend the legislation to say that if somebody has provided advance consent, that at least at the moment the action is happening the person administering it be required to tell them what is happening, and that the person is given the opportunity to, in that moment and regardless of their state of capacity, be able to offer some kind of objection if that is the way they feel. There is nothing in the legislation, as it is written right now, for a person to be told what is happening or asked their opinion in any way in the moment their life is being taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289865"> I do not believe that, as a matter of principle, it is consistent with the ethics of choice and autonomy for my past self to be able to bind my future self. Garnett Genuis on October 19, 2020 might want a future version of myself to behave in a certain fashion, but that future version of myself should still have autonomy to make choices that contradict something that my past self wished for, especially in cases where disease and disability are involved where people adapt to circumstances. They adapt in ways perhaps they do not expect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289866">The third point I want to talk about is that this legislation would bring us death without independent witnesses. It would remove a requirement for independent witnesses to be involved. I just do not see the purpose of that. Why not leave in place a requirement for independent witnesses? It ensures there are not abuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289867">When I finish my remarks, I am going to be sharing my time today with the excellent member for <Affiliation DbId="252538" Type="2">Peace River—Westlock</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289868">People advancing this legislation say it is about choice. I would say, in the context of choice, let us recognize the context and the architecture in which choice is made and let us protect people's ability to make a genuinely autonomous choice. Is that fair enough? Is same-day death consistent with giving people real choice, that the moment they ask for death they receive it right away, or is it more consistent with choice that they have the time and the space to reflect? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289869">Is it consistent with choice to remove the requirement for contemporaneous consent? I do not think so. Is it consistent with choice to remove independent witnesses who can verify what is happening? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289870">Same-day death, death without contemporaneous consent and death without independent witnesses are moving us in a dangerous direction that will leave people vulnerable. In the government's defence of this legislation, it says it held lots of consultations and that virtually everybody it talked to agreed with it. I doubt it. We have already had over 400 physicians sign a letter raising objections to this. We have had a joint letter sent by many faith leaders from different communities across the country. We had over 70 representatives from the disability community come out against this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289871">May I say that the government runs consultations that involve loaded questions: questions that presuppose a particular result. One of my colleagues once talked about another consultation the government did as being like a dating website designed by Fidel Castro. When one asks loaded questions, there will be no meaningful result to the consultation. We are going to have what we have right now, which is hundreds of physicians and dozens of leaders from the disability community speaking out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289872">Finally, is it not sad that the only time we talk about palliative care in the House is when we are bringing in more euthanasia and removing vital safeguards? That is the only time the government pays lip service to palliative care. It is so eager for assisted dying but it is taking no action on assisted living, and it does not appreciate that if people do not have proper assisted living and palliative care available, then they do not have a meaningful choice. People have read the reports about what is happening with seniors care in this country. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289873">People do not have a meaningful choice when they do not have access to the care that they want and need. Let us do more for assisted living, instead of removing vital safeguards that protect people around the assisted dying regime.</ParaText>

People are prisoners in their own bodies and suffering needlessly.</ParaText>

Again, the focus of my remarks was on aspects of this legislation that have nothing to do with court decisions. I want us to remove same-day death, to remove death without contemporaneous consent, and to remove death without independent witnesses. I think all three of those are reasonable changes, and none of them would interact with a court decision that was made.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289889">Madam Speaker, it is my honour and privilege to join this debate today, though it is a sad one for me. I remember coming to this place. We passed Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> right off the get-go. It is where I cut my teeth in politics, I would say. At the time, we mentioned that this was a slippery slope. We had seen it in the Netherlands. Currently the government there is passing legislation to allow children under the age of 12 to be euthanized. They are working with what's called the Groningen protocol, where it is not the individual but a group of doctors making the decision as to who gets to live and who gets to die. Here, we saw that this erosion of protection began virtually as the ink was drying on the original bill. We have seen the government not uphold the wishes of this Parliament. We have seen a junior court strike down the law, calling it unconstitutional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289890">This is where I have some frustration. The ink was not even dry on the bill when it was being challenged in the courts. It had just passed through the House of Commons. It is incumbent upon the executive branch of government to defend the decisions of this place, whether the government agrees with a court or not, and this was a brand new law that had just been thoroughly discussed in this place. We had worked hard for the amendments. For the government to abandon all the work we had done and decide that a junior court decision stood and that it was not going to appeal it to a higher court, like the Supreme Court, was an abdication of the executive branch's responsibility, and I definitely want to acknowledge my frustration that the government did not appeal this court decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289891">That said, this bill is much broader than the court decision, and I would argue that we continue down the slippery slope. When Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was introduced, I remember talking about the slippery slope and being assured it was not a thing. Yet here we are, removing safeguards from the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289892">This bill definitely makes two classes of Canadians. Across the country, we see a big emphasis on suicide prevention. Every level of government in this country has suicide prevention strategies. We see community groups getting together to run hotlines. Facebook has a warning system to help folks who are considering suicide. Facebook will even identify them and notify people who are close to them that their friend is not feeling well. The American military has worked with Facebook as well, to identify veterans who are considering suicide. We see throughout Canadian society that there is very much a focus on preventing suicide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289893">Where does that comes into play in this bill? It would create two levels of Canadians. In one case, there are able-bodied, otherwise healthy people suffering from mental illness who are considering suicide. All of those suicide-prevention apparatuses come to their aid. We even have bridges in this country that have nets to catch people in case they jump. All of that stuff comes to the aid of those particular people. However, for sick people who have a grievous and irremediable condition, that stuff is optional and they can request death. They can go to their doctor and say they are not feeling well and are suffering, and that their grievous and irremediable condition has affected their mental health and they are having suicidal thoughts. Then suddenly they are eligible for assisted suicide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289894"> This creates two classes of people. If they are otherwise healthy, suicide prevention is granted to them; if they have an underlying grievous and irremediable condition, they are eligible for, as the government likes to call it, medical assistance in dying or assisted suicide. That is what this bill would do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289895">Prior to this bill, there was a requirement that a person's death be reasonably foreseeable. I remember that when we were discussing this, we found it to be kind of nebulous. What did that mean? There was no timeline on it. I remember we said that for a death to be reasonably foreseeable, it would have to be in six months or within a year. Those were amendments we brought forward. The government did not go for them back then. Now we see the courts are taking that off and the government is not even defending it. That is definitely one of the concerns we have. We are creating two classes of citizens: one for which suicide prevention is available and one for which it is optional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289896">The other thing I want to talk about is an amendment we brought to the original bill, one that I think would be an improvement on this bill. It is the need for video verification. In the current rendition of the bill, the timelines have been reduced or eliminated altogether, from the time of the request to the time when MAID is administered. There is a concern that family members may not be convinced that their loved one requested MAID and that they were giving consent at the moment thereof. There has been a suggestion by some groups that there be a video recording of the administration of MAID. That is an amendment I would seek at committee. We would definitely like to see something like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289897">Lastly, we would like to see the government work to enhance assistance in living. With COVID, many of our old folks in seniors care facilities are not able to see their loved ones because of restrictions on movements and not being able to travel. The military had to be called in to deal with some of the situations. We talk a lot in this place about dying with dignity, but maybe it is time that we started focusing on living with dignity, having a dignified life, taking care of our elders and being part of a family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289898">I have talked to folks who have been working in the old folks homes lately and it has been a rough job. They say the loneliness is a major issue in old folks homes these days. The loneliness leads to mental health issues, and if those mental health issues are not addressed, people will become suicidal and will request MAID for loneliness. Is that what we really want in this country? Assistance in living is something we have to be concerned about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289899"> This also deals with palliative care. Palliative care is something the government pays lip service to. We have called for national strategies on this. We have called for money to be put into it. In the absence of palliative care, there is no real choice. There is no ability for somebody to say that this is what they are choosing. Palliative care is an acknowledgement that while there is, humanly speaking, nothing more we can do, we can make a person comfortable and allow them to be surrounded by friends and family as they leave this earth. We would very much like to see the government pursue a significant improvement in palliative care, rather than allowing the elderly members of our families to vanish into an old folks home, where we are not allowed to visit them at this point, to die of loneliness and be offered MAID as the first available option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289900">This bill has many concerns. It is the first evidence of the slippery slope that is happening in the euthanasia debate, and I definitely wanted to raise that concern. I am also concerned that this bill creates two classes of citizens, as I clearly outlined. I am looking forward to the government making some amendments to the bill and look forward to being able to participate in those discussions at committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289904">Madam Speaker, I believe that two of my hon. Conservative colleagues in a row have spoken to us about palliative care and care in long-term care facilities, such as CHSLDs in Quebec. It seems to me that they are trying to sidetrack the debate. We are talking here about medical assistance in dying. The two are not related. They seem to be saying that, if we had better palliative care services, then there would be no need for this bill. That does not make any sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289905">However, if they want to go there, then I would tell my hon. colleague that his party was in office from 2006 to 2015 and the provinces were not granted the increased health transfers that the Quebec and other provincial premiers are calling for. In fact, the Conservatives made cuts to those transfers. It seems to me that this party, which is lecturing us on palliative care, had a role to play in the fact that the provinces do not have enough money to manage their jurisdictions.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6289910">Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code, medical assistance in dying. Its proposed Criminal Code amendments to the medical assistance in dying regime are a true reflection of the value we as Canadians ascribe to individual autonomy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289911">I wish today to address a specific aspect of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which is the exclusion from eligibility for medical assistance in dying, or MAID, of those whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness. This is an aspect of the bill that has already attracted some attention, and I am grateful for the opportunity to make these remarks to provide context around the government's choice to not extend medical assistance in dying in this area at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289912">The government has heard from various sources that there are unique risks and complexities associated with medical assistance in dying on the basis of mental illness alone. These include the report of the Council of Canadian Academies' expert panel on medical assistance in dying where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition, as well as the experts the ministers consulted in recent round tables on medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289913">In this Canadian-made context, very specific concerns have been raised in relation to mental illness, those illnesses that affect how a person perceives themselves, their environment, their place within it and sometimes their future. The first main concern is that the trajectory of mental illnesses is harder to predict than that of other illnesses. Unlike some dementia and intellectual disabilities, the underlying causes of mental illness remain largely unknown. Mental illnesses can spontaneously remit or can be difficult to treat for years until one treatment or one social intervention works and improves quality of life, reducing that person's suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289914">For example, we learned from the Council of Canadian Academies' report that an important percentage of persons living with borderline personality disorder will see their symptoms go away as they age, and some people with problematic substance use disorders also spontaneously remit. Experts disagreed on whether a mental illness can ever truly be considered incurable. Indeed, the Canadian Mental Health Association has indicated, “CMHA does not believe that mental illnesses are irremediable, though they may be grievous or unbearable [and] there is always the hope of recovery.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289915">A second main area of concern is that the desire to die can be a symptom of some mental illnesses. Here I address specifically the concerns just raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252538" Type="2">Peace River—Westlock</Affiliation> around suicide. I acknowledge and recognize his sincere concern. Having a mental illness is, indeed, a significant risk factor for suicide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289916">This underscores the difficulty of assessing the voluntariness of a MAID request from a person who may be experiencing a desire to die as a symptom of mental illness. Some practitioners also raised the concern that an expanded MAID regime could negatively impact suicide prevention efforts if MAID were a legal option in response to suffering caused by mental illness alone, both at the level of public messaging and at the individual clinical level. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289917">The Council of Canadian Academies' expert panel also noted the particularly troubling situation of suicide rates in indigenous populations. This is an issue that concerns us all deeply. It was the expert panel's view that the potential impact of MAID where a mental illness is a sole underlying condition, if any, on suicide prevention efforts must be explored more deeply with indigenous people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289918">By contrast, there are other conditions affecting the brain that do not raise these same concerns. For example, the trajectory of cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's Disease or other neurodegenerative diseases is more easily predicted, in large part because the underlying pathology is better understood. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289919">Intellectual disabilities are a permanent state and there are no concerns with an unpredictable illness trajectory or a person's perception of their place in the world being affected. Indeed, many do not consider such conditions to be a mental illness or mental disorder. While they may raise other concerns, these are likely more properly addressed by assessments of decision-making capacity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289920">On the other hand, those who live with mental illness can experience unimaginable suffering and even physical pain. There is no question that the suffering that some with mental illness endure can be intolerable. Some who suffer from both physical and mental illness have said that, if they were able to choose, they would easily choose to endure the physical pain if the mental anguish could end. It is understandable that there is no consensus on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289921">The group of experts the Council of Canadian Academies recruited could not agree on several fundamental questions, including whether it is possible to have a valid and reliable method of distinguishing between suicide and an autonomous decision for medical assistance in dying where a mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289922">A subset of the Council of Canadian Academies' expert panel, the Halifax group, recently recommended that the MAID regime should not exclude persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness. Instead, there should be a legislative requirement that the decision to die be well considered to ensure that a MAID request is well thought out and not impulsive. Others say that to exclude those with mental illness only perpetuates stigma and discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289923"> On the other hand, another subset of the Council of Canadian Academies' experts, the expert advisory group on MAID, recommended that the MAID regime acknowledge that, at this time, it is not possible to determine that a mental illness is irremediable or that a state of decline due to a mental illness is irreversible. Therefore, persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness could not fulfill the current MAID eligibility requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289924">Given these diametrically opposed points of view from experts, it would not be prudent to permit eligibility for medical assistance in dying where a mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition at this time without more study and deliberation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289925">We, as legislators, are not experts in mental illness. Let us, instead, take the time to listen closely to what experts have to say on such an important topic, where the consequences of a decision are irreversible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289926">The parliamentary review will provide an opportunity to hear from experts and others, and allow parliamentarians to carefully consider, without the time pressure of responding to the Truchon decision, whether and how medical assistance in dying could safely be extended to persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289927">The government understands very well that mental illnesses can and does cause intolerable suffering. By excluding persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness, we are not seeking to send a message that this suffering is lesser, that persons struggling with a mental illness cannot make decisions for themselves, or that their autonomy to choose when and how to die matters less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289928">Instead, we are taking a pause and acknowledging that this very complicated question needs more time, careful consideration and requires us to proceed prudently. The Province of Quebec is adopting a similar approach, though not through legislative amendments. I think this is wise, and we will be paying close attention to the consultations taking place in that province as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289938">Madam Speaker, we know that part of the original legislation for medical assistance in dying provided for a review at the five-year mark, and we are coming up to that time. It is very important we exercise that opportunity to look deeply into questions of this kind and canvass them very thoroughly, because it is, as the member noted, a very serious and delicate question. It is very complex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289939">We need to examine all aspects of it, as well as the other aspects of medical assistance in dying, to make sure that as we move forward we can adapt and move forward correctly on this very important bill.</ParaText>

It is important to confirm for Canadians that, in looking at the new version and the amendments, mental illness is not to be considered an illness within the context of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289943">Madam Speaker, I was glad that the member brought up mental health conditions. He was very attentive to the language being proposed in this legislation and how we would deal with it going forward. This piece of legislation goes much further than Justice Baudouin mentioned in her judicial decision where she struck down section 241.2(2)(d) specifically on death being reasonably foreseeable. I do not have a question for the member. I just want to bring this up and hear his commentary on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289944">“Reasonably foreseeable” was something I criticized in the last Parliament when this was being debated. I could foresee this exact situation in which different reasonable people could interpret it in very different ways. We already see this going on all over the country. Different provinces have interpreted it differently in their health systems. I want to hear the member's commentary on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289945">In this debate so far, people have mentioned incurable diseases. The minister mentioned it as well. Three of my living kids have an incurable disease called Alport syndrome. It leads to a chronic kidney condition, and in the case of males, it will eventually require a kidney transplant. In most cases it is also associated with the underlying risk of depression and social isolation. It is incurable today. That does not mean it will be incurable tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289946">Diseases change and their statuses change. Things that were incurable 100 years ago and were considered lifelong conditions change over time as medical technology catches up. Our knowledge matches the necessity of the time we live in. That is my commentary on the member's speech.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289947">Madam Speaker, my understanding on this bill regarding a trajectory for an immediately foreseeable death is that, in some cases, the requirement has been reduced, but in other cases, it remains in place. It depends on the nature of the person's underlying condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289948">I certainly look forward to what I am sure will be a robust debate on medical assistance in dying when the review happens. I had the honour to participate on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights when the original bill was brought forward. I certainly recognize some of the questions we are dealing with now we also dealt with then, and we did the best we could. It is very helpful that in light of experience and court decisions, we can review those decisions. It is a great opportunity, as we move forward, to embrace fully the upcoming review.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289949">Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate the commentary that I have heard from my colleagues about this very significant issue today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289950">One of the things I remember doing in a past life is working with doctors on “do not resuscitate” orders. It became very difficult for doctors, whose oath it is to save lives, to have this type of discussion. They would do anything to get out of a “do not resuscitate” order. They did not want to touch it or undo it, because they were ending up with all sorts of complications with family members and relatives. All sorts of different things would happen with this type of situation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289952">Madam Speaker, I would like to first note that medical assistance in dying and a “do not resuscitate” order are fundamentally vastly different concepts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289953">In any event, I believe the checks and balances that are currently in the legislation around mental illness will prevail as we go forward, because this bill would not extend medical assistance in dying to people whose sole underlying condition is mental illness. That is an important distinction and it is a very important one to consider fully and robustly as we go forward. I refer all members to the opportunity that will present itself as we review the totality of the medical assistance in dying regime at its legislated juncture.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6289954">Madam Speaker, it is a real pleasure for me to be joining the debate today, from my riding, on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. I find myself in a unique position because, having given a speech on this very same bill earlier this year, I see we now find ourselves still at second reading for what, I would argue, is absolutely the most important piece of legislation we have before us at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289955">I was also one of the members of Parliament who had the honour of participating in the previous debate on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> during the 42nd Parliament. I can remember very much the debates that went on in 2016 and the amount of attention that was given to that piece of legislation. We had an expert committee. We had a special joint committee. There were many hours spent, both in the House of Commons and at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, on that important piece of legislation because it made a monumental amendment to the Criminal Code in recognition of a very important Supreme Court ruling that forced Parliament to finally take the necessary action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289956">I remember, during that time, we in the New Democratic caucus ultimately voted against Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, but we always took the time to explain to people that we were ultimately supportive of what the overall aims of the bill were. Our major problem of the time was that the bill was too restrictive. I remember very well in 2016 referencing a particular section of the bill that I knew would be challenged by the court. Lo and behold, here we are in the year 2020, and we are revisiting that problematic section and having to fix a mistake that was made very clearly four years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289957">It is good to see Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, and it is good to see that we are complying with challenges that were made before the courts, this time coming in response to the Truchon decision by the Superior Court of Quebec. I know that we are operating under quite a tight deadline. That being said, I still think Parliament has to do a full job on this bill. As parliamentarians, whether we support the legislation, have problems with it or are opposed to it, we owe it to the people of Canada to give this debate as full a discussion and time as Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289958">At this time, in particular for the benefit of the people of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, it is important to underline why we are here discussing this. It really centres on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, notably sections 7 and 15.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289959"> I am increasingly seeing section 7 as probably the most important part of the charter or one of the most important parts, because so many cases seem to be coming forward that directly reference section 7. I know it is open to interpretation, but if we go along with successive court rulings, my own personal view on the subject is that it is a very important section because it is ultimately making the case that every person in Canada has the right to autonomy over their own body. That is why it is such an important section. If we truly believe in the rights of individuals to make decisions for themselves over what goes on with their own bodies, section 7 is incredibly important. It is really life, liberty and security of the person. That is the part that has to be underlined.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289960">We also have to mention section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees quality before and under the law and makes sure people are free from discrimination. Why those two sections have such an important bearing in this case is that this bill is trying to make sure people have the right to say what goes on with their own bodies and that in making that decision they are not going to be discriminated against.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289961"> I have been listening to the debates on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, both from the previous week and today. I acknowledge that many members are bringing forward some concerns with the bill, and I understand and want to validate those concerns. I do not believe we have to make the debate on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> an overly partisan issue. That is why I made the comment at the beginning that it is important that all members of Parliament, no matter what party they belong to, be given the chance to fully air their views.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289962"> I believe the bill passes muster at second reading and deserves a vote of confidence at this stage of debate, because if there are particular sections of the bill that need further attention, that work is best done at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289963"> I fully understand that many members have raised concerns about the removal of safeguards. I have heard many members talk about the state of palliative care in Canada, whether there is enough being done with suicide prevention and so on, and I am very sympathetic to those. I think every member of Parliament, no matter what part of the country we are fortunate enough to represent, can relate to those concerns. We can relate to the concerns that we have received through email correspondence, letters, phone calls and speaking with our constituents face to face. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289964">I am lucky enough to have a hospice undergoing major construction right now. There is a new hospice being built in the Cowichan Valley. I am really glad to see that the level of palliative care in my home riding is going to be significantly better than it was, but of course more can always be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289965">Ultimately what is guiding me in this is that it is quite impossible for me, as a member of Parliament who is lucky enough to have his health and not have a grievous and irremediable medical condition, to really understand the level of suffering some individuals in Canada go through. When we are talking about the bill, the struggle we have before us is to not subject other people to our own values, whether those are guided by religious beliefs or the way we were raised and so on. It is quite impossible for people who are healthy and lucky enough to have all of their faculties to understand what the day-to-day life existence is of people who are suffering from one of these incurable and irremediable medical conditions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289966">Therefore, what is guiding me and members of the New Democratic caucus is an overall goal of trying to ease that suffering, to respect those people's section 7 rights and to understand that they should have the ability to live their lives in dignity and make a determination as to how they want to exit this world. I know it is an uncomfortable debate for many people to have, but that is what is going to be guiding me through these deliberations. I hope it is something all members can take note of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289967">Following on the speech my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253064" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation>, gave the other day concerning the legislative review that was part of the former Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, I want to draw the attention of members to the fact that this was a requirement of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. The member for <Affiliation DbId="253064" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> has put forward a proposal through his private member's motion, Motion No. 51, that will establish a special committee to look at how the legislation is doing. That is something Parliament can easily do while we are deliberating the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. The creation of such a special committee to look at how Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> has been enacted over the last four years is really important.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289968">This goes back to my first point that, yes we are operating under deadlines, yes we have had people waiting for some time, but, ultimately, it is critically important that we let Parliament deliberate this issue to the fullest extent possible. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6289986">Mr. Speaker, I apologize in advance if there is noise in the background; it is either traffic or my kids, so I have chosen traffic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289987">I want to start first by speaking to what is at stake with Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and with the medical assistance in dying framework overall. What is at stake fundamentally is, first, alleviating intolerable, cruel suffering. The Supreme Court and other courts have spoken about the cruel choice that individuals face in the circumstance where they have a sound mind, they are of capacity and can make these decisions themselves, where they are suffering from an illness that is not going to go away and when they are suffering in an intolerable way. Forcing that suffering upon individuals is cruel and we have to be cognizant of the fact that this is first and foremost about alleviating suffering, but it is about alleviating suffering within the context of empowering and respecting one's personal autonomy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289988">This is fundamentally about individual rights, and our job fundamentally is to respect those individual rights, to protect those individual rights, to ensure that we end suffering in the course of protecting those individual rights and to make sure that we fulfill the promise of section 7 as it has been interpreted and upheld by our courts, not only in the unanimous Carter decision by the Supreme Court, but also by other courts, like the Alberta Court of Appeal and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289989">Now, this bill is important, because it addresses a long-standing concern with Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. It addresses the concern that we had not answered the call from the Supreme Court adequately. We had added an additional criterion unnecessarily. We had basically said that if people are suffering intolerably and they can absolutely make this choice for themselves, they have capacity, and they have an irremediable condition, an effectively incurable illness, they cannot access this regime if they are not near the end of life or there is not path dependency, but they know the trajectory they are on, even if they are already intolerably suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289990">That, obviously, was unconstitutional. The courts determined that to be so. The government rightly opted not to appeal that decision, and here we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289991">Importantly, we have actually gone beyond what the court has mandated in pursuit of individual rights and respect for our charter, as we have said in the case of Audrey Parker, a woman who chose to end her life earlier than she had wanted to. She wanted to get through the holiday season, but she also did not want to lose capacity and then lose the option. She did not want to lose ability to end her life and her suffering. She did not want to lose the possibility of death with dignity, so she chose to end her life before she wanted to. Thankfully, we have actually gone above and beyond what the court has mandated us to do, and we have provided one form of advance request to ensure that individuals, like in Audrey's case, do not end their life before they would like to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289992">This bill, on those two fronts, is positive. There are some challenges. That is not going to stop me from supporting this legislation at second reading, but it does give one pause. I think we, as parliamentarians, have to be very careful about adding additional exclusions to accessing the MAID regime. That is what this bill would do, unfortunately. I have heard others speak to the issue of mental illness, and there are reasons to proceed cautiously, but there are not good reasons for blanket exclusions. In fact, we potentially render the bill unconstitutional with blanket exclusions, just as we did with exclusions in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289993">I hope at committee there is expert testimony on this piece, and I hope we get this right. I will give an example specifically on mental illness. In 2016, there was a case at the Alberta Court of Appeal. A woman, identified as E.F., had capacity, she was suffering intolerably, it was irremediable, she had consulted with her family and she had made the decision to end her life. She was able to do so, thankfully, because of the Alberta Court of Appeal applying the Carter decision by the Supreme Court. If the federal justice department had gotten its way in that case, it would have read down Carter to mean only terminal illness. Of course, they said that is not the case. Then we saw, through Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, that our government tried to impose that kind of criteria, and the court subsequently struck it down. The justice department lost that leg of the argument.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289994">Then, in E.F., they put forward the argument that it could not be an underlying psychiatric condition on its own, but that is exactly what E.F.'s was, an underlying psychiatric condition. The court said that this underlying psychiatric condition, which manifested itself in great significant pain in the documented evidence, did not affect her capacity to make a decision. She was of sound mind.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6289995">In E.F., the Alberta Court of Appeal went beyond that. As to the consideration whether MAID should be available to people with mental illness as their sole underlying condition, the Alberta Court of Appeal, in E.F., said that the Supreme Court, in Carter, had canvassed this conversation, this discussion and this concern. Unanimously, they had determined that it was not an additional exclusion. It was not a factor to exclude, and not an additional criterion for eligibility, for those with mental illnesses and those with physical illnesses, so long as they meet the specific criterion of an irremediable condition of intolerable suffering and that they have capacity. It may be that one is depressed, or it may be that one is suffering from a mental health issue such that it impinges upon one's capacity to consent, but in other cases it clearly does not. In E.F., it did not. The justice lawyers lost that case, yet here we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289996"> In Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the government added an additional criterion of close-to-terminal illness and reasonably foreseeable death, and it was struck down. Here, the justice department is adding that second argument from E.F. that it already lost in the courts, and is adding a blanket exclusion for mental illness. As a matter of constitutionality, I would say that if this excludes the case of E.F., which it does, then it creates a ready constitutional challenge. I will be reading the Charter statement from the justice department very closely. I am not suggesting that we do not proceed cautiously, but a blanket exclusion on mental health, when there is a case like E.F. before the court, is likely to render this law unconstitutional, and that has to be addressed by the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289997">The second piece I want to flag is the two tracks. If one's death is reasonably foreseeable, then there is no additional track. There is not even a 10-day waiting period. That 10-day waiting period has been waived, although there was not great concern even with that 10-day waiting period. There is this dual track now, if one's death is not reasonably foreseeable, where one waits 90 days. This is what we are telling people in those circumstances. I have spoken to family members who are affected by this, and they are absolutely challenged by these circumstances when one is already intolerably suffering: They are suffering from a condition that is not going to go away, and they are making this decision themselves, having capacity. If we respect personal autonomy at all, surely a fundamental life decision like this is one that we have to respect, and we are telling these individuals that they have to wait another 90 days, and not just suffer but suffer intolerably for another 90 days. It is inexplicable that we are asking people to suffer intolerably for that length of time. Those are the two specific issues that need to be addressed at committee in a serious way in order to make this bill not only constitutional, but to make it the best bill that it can be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289998">I wish we had dealt with this last item, because the idea of constantly revisiting this conversation instead of just getting it right for Canadians in need is frustrating. I mentioned Audrey Parker, and we are addressing one type of advance request. However, I do wish that, in the course of this legislation, we had answered the second type of advance request, in which an individual has been diagnosed and is not yet suffering intolerably, but that future is not so far away. Those individuals should also be in a place where they can make an advance request, if we are to respect their autonomy and respect their wishes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6289999">I just wish politics did not get in the way. That is what this is. This bill is a cautionary step. It does not go as far as it could because of politics. I know Conservative members will say it goes too far and others will say we have to be concerned about vulnerable Canadians. We know we can protect vulnerable Canadians and respect people's individual choices at the same time, and I wish politics did not get in the way of alleviating suffering. I wish politics did not get in the way of respecting and protecting individual rights. We like to say we are the party of the Charter. I wish we carried through that promise and demanded greater respect for individual rights in the course of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290003">Mr. Speaker, it is supportable, particularly at second reading. The Council of Canadian Academies identified three kinds of advance requests. One is as in the case of Audrey Parker, which I mentioned, where someone not only is diagnosed but is already suffering intolerably. This bill would address that issue, and I am glad that it would.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290004">The second issue, which I think is easy to address and has been recommended up and down by every expert who has looked at this, is when one has already been diagnosed but is not yet subject to intolerable suffering. We ought to provide an advance request for that as well. We could address it with sunset clauses if folks are concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290005">The third issue is when someone has not yet been diagnosed. I would argue that we could probably get there, but I think, at a minimum, we should address the second advance request where someone has already been diagnosed, but is not yet suffering intolerably. That would have been a relatively straightforward one to address. Given the time period we have had, especially in the course of COVID, I wish this had been better addressed in this bill, as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290009">Mr. Speaker, the advantage of any view that respects personal autonomy is that one is not tied to a decision one has made: one can always revisit it. The importance of advance requests is that people might lose capacity. If one is suffering intolerably, as in the case of Audrey Parker, but is so worried that she is not going to be able to make a decision to end her life and access death with dignity because she might lose capacity, then we, of course, need an advance request and that is exactly what this bill would provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290010">As for the second category, where an individual has been diagnosed and has not yet begun to suffer intolerably, when they have made it very clear that this is what they want as a matter of personal autonomy, we have to respect that as well.

I think the committee should examine this timeline and correct it. I hope, when this bill comes back to the House for third reading, that we have avoided the blanket exclusion for mental illness. If need be, we can add a sunset clause to that provision to give the government more time, if necessary, but I hope we avoid the blanket exclusion indefinitely. Second, I hope that we cure that 90-day period and reduce it significantly. We cannot possibly want Canadians who are still of sound mind to suffer intolerably for such an extended period of time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290022">I think these statements are important, because the reality is that every time we talk about expanding access to MAID, we send a troubling message to those who may be vulnerable: the idea that, if certain conditions or factors are present, somehow a person's life has less worth; the idea that ending a person's life is a mere medical decision among any number of medical decisions.</ParaText>

This bill intends to offer assisted dying to individuals who are not dying, whose lives are still viable.

Many, many other things should be made easier. This [assisted death] is not one of them.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290062"> As members know, prior to the prorogation of Parliament, we introduced former Bill <Document DbId="10648716" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which proposed amendments to the MAID legislation and made it to second reading in the House. With the opening of this new session, we are reintroducing the same proposed changes as Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290063">In September 2019, the Superior Court of Quebec struck down the federal and Quebec criteria limiting MAID to end-of-life circumstances. The court suspended its declaration of invalidity for six months, until March 11, 2020. In February, the Attorney General of Canada obtained an extension to provide enough time for Parliament to respond to the Quebec court's ruling and create a consistent MAID regime across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290064">Unfortunately, the disruptions to the parliamentary process resulting from COVID-19 made it impossible to meet this deadline. On June 29, the Superior Court of Quebec granted the request of the Attorney General of Canada for a second extension, until December 18, 2020. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290065">Before I turn to the content of the bill, this legislation was informed by the Truchon decision itself, available Canadian international reports, the experience of existing international regimes and the government's consultations on medical aid in dying held in January and February earlier this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290066">With respect to the consultations, the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> as well as their parliamentary secretaries hosted medical aid in dying round tables across the country. There were more than 125 stakeholders in attendance, including health regulatory bodies, legal experts, doctors, nurse practitioners, representatives of the disability community and indigenous representatives. They all shared their experiences and insights into MAID and its implementation in Canada over the last four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290067">In parallel to these efforts, the government hosted an online public survey in January and received over 300,000 responses from people all across the country, an unprecedented number of responses, that reflects the significance of this issue for Canadians. A summary of the consultations was released in March as a “What We Heard Report”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290068"> I would like to speak to the two proposed Criminal Code amendments in relation to eligibility for MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290069">First, the bill would amend the list of eligibility criteria so that it would no longer be necessary for a person’s natural death to be reasonably foreseeable. This change would respond directly to the Quebec Superior Court’s ruling in Truchon and Gladu.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290070">Second, the amendments proposed in this bill would make persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness ineligible for MAID. Members may recall that the Council of Canadian Academies’ expert group on this issue could not come to a consensus on this question. This lack of agreement was also evident among participants at the MAID roundtables. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290071">This complicated issue should be studied as part of the five-year parliamentary review of the medical aid in dying legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290072">With respect to applicable safeguards, the proposed Criminal Code amendments will create two different sets of safeguards, depending on whether the person's natural death is reasonably foreseeable or not. The first set of safeguards will continue to be tailored to the persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable where risks are reduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290073">The second set of safeguards would be tailored to persons whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable or who are not dying at all and would address the elevated risks associated with the diverse sources of suffering and vulnerability that could lead to a person who is not nearing death to seek access to medical aid in dying.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290074">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> proposes to use the “reasonable foreseeability of natural death” standard to determine which set of safeguards apply to a particular case. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6290075">In terms of those whose death is reasonably foreseeable, the bill proposes to ease some of the existing safeguards. Specifically, it would require that a medical aid in dying request be witnessed by one independent witness instead of two, and it would allow individuals who are paid to provide either health or personal care to act as an independent witness. Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> also proposes to repeal the 10-day mandatory reflection period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290076">With respect to the second set of safeguards that would apply to those whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, in addition to the same witness requirement being eased, the following new and clarified safeguards would apply.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6290077">The first new safeguard would require a minimum period of 90 days for the assessment of a person’s eligibility. This safeguard reflects the need to ensure that the assessment takes the time needed to address the additional challenges and concerns that may arise in the context of assessing the MAID request of a person whose death is not foreseeable, and who may have many years or even decades left to live. These include, for example, considering whether the person’s suffering is caused by factors other than the medical condition and whether there are ways to address the suffering other than MAID.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6290078">The second new safeguard would require that one of the two mandatory eligibility assessments be conducted by a practitioner with expertise in the condition that is causing the person's suffering. This would require that all treatment options to be explored before medical aid in dying is provided, while avoiding the need for specialist involvement, which could pose a barrier in remote and rural areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290079">The existing requirement for informed consent would be clarified in two ways. First, the person would have to receive information on available and appropriate services that could help address their situation. Second, the person and the practitioners would have to agree that reasonable means to alleviate the person's suffering had been seriously considered before medical aid in dying could be provided. These proposed safeguards reflect the seriousness of ending the life of someone who is not nearing death, the importance of protecting vulnerable individuals who may seek medical aid in dying and would support a fully informed decision in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290080">The bill also proposes amendments that would allow people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable and who have been assessed and approved for medical aid in dying to retain their ability to receive MAID if they lose the capacity to consent before the day of the procedure. Certain conditions would need to be met, including having a scheduled date for the procedure, that the person gives consent to receive MAID on that date even if they have lost capacity, and that the practitioner agrees to provide MAID on the patient's scheduled date or before if the capacity is lost before that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290081">This bill, I believe, seeks to balance several interests and societal values, including the autonomy of persons who are eligible to receive medical aid in dying and the need to protect vulnerable persons from being induced to end their lives. It represents a significant paradigm shift, and I hope one that will meet the consensus of the members of this Parliament.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252815" Type="2">Mr. Pat Kelly (Calgary Rocky Ridge, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6290099">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate. The last several speakers raised some excellent points. It is good to see members bring different perspectives to this debate, and I hope to achieve that as well tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290100">I would like to say broadly at the outset that, in a binary world where one must say they are either in favour or not in favour of the availability of medical assistance in dying for people who are adults, mentally competent, grievously and irremediably ill and suffering cruelly from intolerable pain and anguish, I support the availability of assistance in dying for those people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290101">However, this bill and few bills we would consider in the House are as simple as a binary choice between two poles. Although we have had all kinds of different perspectives on this, the nuances and the details of this bill, as well as the bill that preceded it, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, are very important. I enjoy these types of debates where we hear these points of view and can hopefully improve a bill before it is passed, if it is indeed the will of this Parliament to pass the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290102">I have ordinarily been highly critical of the government on a host of issues. I will take advantage of this moment to say that although there was much consternation to get to the final vote that occurred on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in the previous Parliament, there was something in that process that brought out what is good in Parliament. At that time, we had a lot of different perspectives on that bill. We had a bill that was tabled and amended. It was amended in this chamber. It had committee amendments, many of them, that were brought back and voted on by different parties, and we saw members of the Liberals' side who did not agree with their government for a variety of reasons. There were members, including me, who ultimately at third reading did vote with the government to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290103">That is what Parliament should do. It should bring out vigorous debate that really gets to the heart of an issue in order to have good legislation. I thought Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, at the time, was a reasonable, limited change to criminal law in Canada to both comply with the Carter decision and establish the availability of medical assistance in dying. Credit also should go to members who are no longer a part of the government: the member for <Affiliation DbId="253061" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, who was the minister of justice at the time; and Jane Philpott, who was the minister of health and who showed leadership at that time in debating Bill C-14.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290104">The bill before us today was introduced ostensibly to deal with the Truchon decision and the Quebec superior court's striking down of the reasonable foreseeability phrase from Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. In this bill, the government has chosen to address other issues at this time. As has been pointed out, there was to be a five-year review, per the previous bill, that should have occurred this summer. I understand the crisis we are in, but let us also not forget we have a government that prorogued the House and prevented the House from examining critical legislation and issues that face Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290105">The timing of the bill puts us up against something of a deadline looming in December over the Truchon decision, and here we are. December is not very far away when we talk about all the different stages a bill must go through to do it right, to allow all voices to be heard and to allow all members of Parliament to represent their constituents on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290106">The bill introduces a few changes beyond addressing the reasonable foreseeability. I am not going to get into the details of that, because time is pressing. However, like most MPs, I have received a lot of correspondence and phone calls from the disability community and concerned citizens who have real reservations about any expansion of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290107">Some have argued from the point of view of a slippery slope and are concerned: Once changes are adopted, what comes after them? I understand the sincerity of these concerns. However, we have to examine the bill for what it says and what it does rather than what people might project into it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290108">Prior to the adoption of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, I had four major concerns regarding medical assistance in dying: first, the assurance that quality palliative care be available to persons considering medical assistance in dying; second, strong safeguards for vulnerable Canadians, such as minors, the mentally ill and the disabled; third, the conscience protection for medical practitioners; and fourth, any changes that would expand the availability of medical assistance in dying be well considered, well thought out, carefully drafted and not rushed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290109">I share many of the concerns raised by members of the disability community, but we have to deal with this issue and not forget the broader purpose of ensuring the availability of medical assistance in dying. It is not merely to comply with court rulings. We must do this out of a sense of compassion for adults who are grievously ill, intolerably suffering and are of sound mind, and who, of their own free will and volition, wish to obtain medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290110">I would not support the bill if I thought it was a clear threat to disabled Canadians or if the bill would lead us into a path where medical assistance in dying is offered as an alternative to palliative care or an alternative to treatment. I do not see that in the bill as is. Recalling the experience of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, I assume that the bill will be thoroughly studied and that the committee, after it hears testimony from experts and concerned Canadians, will bring amendments back to the House that may offer better assurance to the disabled community and others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290111">I am inclined to see the bill go forward as far as committee so that we can have a robust, thorough examination of the bill, and so that as parliamentarians, we can do our legislative jobs to ensure that the best bill possible is brought back to Parliament. I look forward to that and assume that we will have this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290112">I am still a little concerned, though. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252608" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation> mentioned the five-year review and that a committee hearing would constitute that review. This is what it sounded like he was saying, and this does not seem to be in the spirit of what was passed by the House in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. However, there is clearly much work to do in this area, and I hope we will have time for a robust, full and proper hearing of the bill at committee so that when the bill comes back to the chamber at third reading, it will give assurances to those who have raised concerns about medical assistance in dying, in particular to the disabled community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290131">Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the last question has brought us to the issue of urgency and why this is pressing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290132">We had this bill before us in the spring, before we adjourned and before COVID-19 took over our parliamentary process. We now have the process, for which I am grateful to all parties, that allows us to debate controversial legislation, to have votes at a distance, to respect the threat of COVID-19 and to protect public health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290133">When debating this bill before we adjourned, I was getting emails in the House from one of my best friends, who was dying of ALS. She asked me if there was any chance we would make changes to the bill for advance directives in time to help her. I deeply regret that we were unable to get this bill passed last spring, when my friend, Angela Rickman, could have benefited from access to medical assistance in dying. She died in a situation of suffering that would have been her wish to avoid. Now, as we debate this, a member of my own family is wondering whether we can get this bill through quickly enough so that they are not put in the impossible situation that Audrey Parker found herself in. I will reflect further on Audrey Parker later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290134">There is urgency, whether driven by courts or by compassion. We know as legislators, as our friend from <Affiliation DbId="252591" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> just commented a few speeches ago, that we have, at this point, repeatedly passed legislation that did not meet the judicial thresholds and frameworks that have been set before us in order to ensure that the legislation we pass on medical assistance in dying meets previous court decisions. I know everybody is deeply affected by their own constituents, their own personal experiences and their frameworks of religious traditions or lack thereof, but I hope we all come to this with open hearts, recognizing that this is a crucially important issue, one that I hope our Parliament will handle better than we have in the past. Let us make sure we pass legislation that does meet the constitutional requirements that have been put before us, if for no other reason than making sure we do not have to continually return to improve our legislation. Ensuring it meets the bar that was set for us by our courts has to be paramount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290135">I happen to come from a constituency where, overwhelmingly, constituents have wanted to see medical assistance in dying legalized for many years. My colleagues in the chamber and watching remotely will remember the name Sue Rodriguez. Sue Rodriguez was a resident in my constituency, in North Saanich. Her first effort, which was, of course, the case she brought forward, was the first time the Supreme Court of Canada ruled, by a very narrow margin, that medical assistance in dying would not be allowed in Canada. That was back in 1993, and it was by a vote of five to four that the Supreme Court denied her final wish. She was able to access illegal assistance from a doctor who remains unknown, but God bless him, and she achieved medical assistance in her own death in February 1994. It was not a situation we would want any of our loved ones to find themselves in, unable to find the help legally and choosing to find someone willing to help otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290136">The next set of cases, of course, bring us to more recent cases, the ones we talk about in Parliament today, and particularly the one that brought us to Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in the previous Parliament, brought forward after the 2015 election. The names of the ministers who were involved have been referenced several times: the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253061" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> and, of course, the former minister of health, Jane Philpott.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290137">I lamented then, in this place, that the Carter decision of the Supreme Court of Canada was not being respected fully in the legislation that we were debating. I was able, in clause by clause consideration at committee, to bring forward amendments, which were rejected there, to do away with the requirement that someone be capable and competent on the day of the procedure to confirm their desire for medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290138">It is that requirement that drove Audrey Parker to have to get medical assistance in dying before the moment she really wanted to, for fear that she would be unable to provide that consent through the vagaries of the disease or the pain-killing drugs. We know Audrey Parker's story. It was related to us today earlier by the current member for <Affiliation DbId="253003" Type="2">Markham—Stouffville</Affiliation> and by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252495" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>, who knows the Audrey Parker story well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290139">She died November 1, 2018, nearly two years ago, saying that this Parliament had let her down through the requirement that she be competent the day of the procedure to confirm that it was, indeed, her wish. This was impractical. Even as we worked in Parliament on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, we knew from the language in the Carter decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that this was a violation of patients' constitutional rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290140">When the bill got to the Senate, I was very pleased that the amendments I put forward in clause by clause, which had been rejected in the House, were taken up and approved by the Senate. However, as we will recall, when the bill came back from the Senate, the government rejected the amendments to deal with ensuring that people would have access to medical assistance in dying and to deny patients access to an advance directive. Predictably, here we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290141">As many of us argued in Parliament in the first round of debates on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> on medical assistance in dying, we were not, as a Parliament, passing legislation that was likely to survive a court challenge. There was not much prescience or crystal ball-gazing to know it. We knew it if we read our legislation and compared it to the reasoning in the Carter decision. Here we are now with a new decision, the Truchon decision from the Quebec Superior Court, and we are going back to amend the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290142">What we are doing, of course, is making sure that people in a situation where they do face a terminal illness and their doctors know that they cannot survive this illness will be able to access an advance directive. Again this was the Carter decision. The Carter decision was full square about facing irremediable suffering and accessing medical assistance in dying. Clearly in this legislation, we have said mental illness is not going to be covered, that mental health issues will not be considered an illness that can be considered irremediable in the context of this legislation. We will very likely have to come back and revisit that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290143">Certainly, as this legislation goes forward from this vote at second reading to committee, I hope we will find a way to amend the legislation to remove the 90-day timeline around assessing someone's irremediable state of suffering. I support what the member for <Affiliation DbId="252591" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> has said on this. It does not appear at all to be a humane decision or within what the courts have already told us to insist on that 90-day period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290144">There are some things that have been argued today in this House that I want to draw attention to because I would hate for Canadians to think that this bill was as cavalier as some would have us believe. Some have said that this bill would allow for “death on demand”. That was one phrase used by one hon. colleague. It's important to know that the bill says quite the contrary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290145">One of my friends in the House said this bill does not make any effort to allow someone to change their mind the day of the procedure. I urge colleagues to look at subclause (3.1)(d). It is very clear. They should also look at subclauses (3.2), (3.4) and (3.5). Throughout the bill, there are many points at which it is very clear that people have the ability to say, and doctors have the requirement to verify that people have the ability, even on an advance directive, to subsequently change their minds. That is a very clear set of provisions in the legislation, as I said, particularly under subclause (3). To clarify again, in subclause (3.1)(d), it is very clear that one has to ensure that people have been informed that they may, at any time and in any manner, withdraw their request. That is the context throughout this bill.</ParaText>

The medical experts engaged must have specific knowledge of whatever particular irremediable condition is being raised. The question of eliminating a 10-day waiting period is not to make it on demand.

At that point, I think we let down individual human beings across Canada. I do not think we should do it again. I think the 90-day period is an arbitrary bureaucratic response to trying to find the balance points between those competing interests. What we should always be thinking about and what should be paramount is respecting the rights of individual Canadians at the point they are in irremediable suffering as confirmed by their physicians.</ParaText>

I would like to address these concerns.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290165">She went on to say that, “A person can be approaching a natural death based on medical circumstances that are not directly related to a serious, incurable illness.

The Supreme Court did not deal with this issue in Carter, and the views of Canadians and stakeholders, as you know, are divided. I understand the hardship for those Canadians who fear that after being diagnosed with a disease such as dementia they may experience a decline that could compromise their dignity. This has led to pleas to allow people to make requests for medical assistance in dying well in advance of the time when the person is no longer competent to make or reaffirm a desire to accelerate their own death.</QuotePara>

I would prefer Parliament get this right rather than a court striking down the legislation in the future as it could lead to the situation we find ourselves in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290174">The other issue I want to touch on stems from the Truchon decision. The Superior Court of Quebec struck down Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>'s provision that death had to be reasonably foreseeable. One could argue the government should have appealed the superior court decision, as we have spoken about in other speeches and questions tonight. It would not be an unusual step as the Government of Canada appeals all sorts of lower court decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290175">While I was not expected to be consulted on the government's response to the Truchon case, there has been very little public discussion from the Liberals about the likelihood of prevailing at the Supreme Court. My only question would be this. If the government did appeal to the Supreme Court, could it have gotten a more limited and narrow ruling on the implications of deleting the reasonably foreseeable clause?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290176">By completely removing this clause, even with a new set of safeguards, it will expand the list of people who might be eligible for MAID rather than just dealing with the specific concern raised in the Truchon case. The very reason the reasonably foreseeable clause was put in the original legislation was that the former ministers wanted a balance between personal autonomy and the protection of the vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290177">Obviously the Superior Court of Quebec did not approve of the balance the Liberals sought in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. However, in response, we must be mindful of the unintended consequences of this legislation. I know every member of Parliament has been contacted by their constituents about the implications of removing reasonably foreseeable criteria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290178">There are varying degrees of concern, ranging from moral and ethical grounds to concerns about the role of the state in sanctioning MAID for individuals who are doing so out of the lack of proper palliative care services. The government has decided in this bill to continue to allow doctors and individuals to decide what constitutes a grievous and irremediable medical condition rather than provide a prescriptive list of eligibility criteria. As someone who believes in individual rights and in the judgment of medical experts, I agree with this approach. My only concern is that we have left it too vague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290179">The government could have eliminated the reasonably foreseeable clause and replaced the original criteria with something that would be deemed constitutional rather than what we have before us today. There are those with apprehensions that proceeding this way will lead to situations where individuals will seek MAID and even be able to proceed for reasons no one in Parliament intended it to. I, for one, would like to see the law as written and intended by the drafters be carried out accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290180">That is one of my concerns that must be answered fully before we pass the legislation and send it to the Senate. While the legislation explicitly states that having a mental illness is not a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability, we must be prepared to withstand that court challenge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290181">To refer back to the 2016 debate on MAID, Jane Philpott, at the justice committee, said, “There is no denying that mental illness can cause profound suffering. However, illnesses such as chronic depression, cognitive disorders and schizophrenia raise particular concerns with respect to the matter of informed decision making.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290182">It goes without saying that there are deep divisions on the overall issue of MAID. What we find in this bill goes much further than deleting and replacing the phrase “reasonably foreseeable” in order to be compliant with the recent court decision. For example, the government is using safeguards which, I might add, is the actual language found within the presentation with which department officials briefed MPs. As it stands, patients must make a written request for MAID that is witnessed by two independent witnesses. In Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, this would be changed to one independent witness. I believe it is incumbent on the government to justify this change and outline the rationale why it needed to be amended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290183">Last, the government is also be removing the mandatory 10-day period after the written request is signed. Once again, this is a significant change that goes above and beyond what was required to be in compliance with the Superior Court of Quebec decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290184">I have listened closely to the concerns of constituents about the bill, I support it going to committee for scrutiny and clarity. I want government to know I am committed to working with them constructively on the legislation.</ParaText>

Maybe the hon. member could speak to the importance of due process in getting legislation right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290199">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to stand in the House of Commons and participate in the second reading debate on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code, medical assistance in dying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290200">In developing these amendments, Canadians were widely consulted in January 2020. During these consultations, approximately 300,000 Canadians completed an online questionnaire. In addition, the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> met with experts and stakeholders in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa and Quebec City to discuss proposed revisions to Canada's medical assistance in dying framework. These experts and stakeholders included doctors, nurses, legal experts, national indigenous organizations and representatives from the disability community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290201"> The high level of participation in both the questionnaire and the in-person sessions is a reflection of the importance of this issue to Canadians. Moreover, the results of consultations were critically important in shaping our government's approach to medically assisted dying as it evolves to reflect the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290202">The bill would amend the Criminal Code to allow medical assistance in dying for people who wish to access a medically assisted death whether their natural death is reasonably foreseeable or not. The bill would remove the reasonable foreseeability of natural death from the list of eligibility criteria. It would also expressly exclude people seeking medical assistance in dying solely because of mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290203">The bill proposes a two-track approach based on whether a person's natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Existing safeguards remain and are used for people whose death is reasonably foreseeable. In addition, new and modified safeguards would be applied to eligible persons whose death is not reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290204">In the spirit of “nothing without us”, I would like to mention that our government remains focused on addressing the concerns of the disability community around vulnerability and choice. The proposed changes to the legislation supports greater autonomy and freedom of choice for eligible persons who wish to pursue a medically assisted death. At the same time, full consideration has been given to the protection of vulnerable persons and to respecting the equality rights and dignity of persons with a disability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290205">In short, the bill maintains and strengthens safeguards to support fully informed decision-making while also respecting individual autonomy. The bill would allow people who risk losing decision-making capacity to make arrangements with their practitioners to receive medically assisted dying on their chosen date even if they lose the decision-making capacity before that date. The bill would also make advance consent invalid if the person demonstrates refusal or resistance to the administration of medically assisted dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290206">In addition, the bill would allow eligible persons who choose to self-administer to provide advance consent or for a physician to administer if self-administration fails and causes them to lose capacity. This type of advance consent would be available for eligible persons regardless of their prognosis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290207">I would also like to take a moment to speak to the progress our government has made with respect to the rights of persons with disabilities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290208"> Last year, we enacted the Accessible Canada Act, which aims to create a barrier-free Canada through the proactive identification, removal and prevention of barriers to accessibility wherever Canadians interact within areas under federal jurisdiction. The act is one of the most significant advancements in disability rights since the charter in 1982 and is designed to inspire a cultural transformation toward disability inclusion and accessibility in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290209">Knowing that I do not have that much time left, I would say that members of my community as well as members of my family and members of the greater Parkinson's and Alzheimer's community have been very vociferous on this issue, and both of those diseases affect people in my family. I am strongly in favour of the bill passing as quickly as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290216">As parliamentarians we must take immediate action to keep Mi'kmaq fishers and their communities safe from the ongoing threats and acts of violence that are happening there. We must ensure the federal government is taking immediate action to provide justice for the Mi'kmaq victims of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290217">We need to make sure that they can adequately and properly exercise their inherent, treaty-protected, constitutionally protected right to safely go out, fish and earn a moderate living. Lastly, we must make sure the government is at the table, providing enough resources to accommodate their right to fish for a moderate living, as they should have 21 years ago. Given the urgency for a peaceful and equitable resolution to this crisis, I believe it is important that we have this emergency debate in Parliament today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290218">I want to talk about why it is so important. The Mi'kmaq fishers have established a fishery beyond millennia in Nova Scotia. As we know, their treaty rights in the 1752 treaties of peace and friendship were confirmed again by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall case of 1999. The federal government has had over 21 years to accommodate and negotiate the definition of a “moderate livelihood” with the Mi'kmaq people, a definition that was confirmed but not defined in the Marshall decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290219"> It was not the first or only time the highest court in the land reaffirmed the constitutional rights of aboriginal people to catch and sell fish in their territories. Whether it be the Marshall decision, the Sparrow decision, the Gladstone decision or the Ahousaht et al. decision, these are all rulings by the court reaffirming indigenous rights that were followed by years of utter disregard by the federal government of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290220">We talk about the treaty rights of the Mi'kmaq and their implementation. They are out there right now fishing to feed their families, to earn a moderate living with less than 1% of the traps and the crab pots out in St. Marys Bay. We know that the response has been acts of domestic terrorism and intimidation against the Mi'kmaq fishers, who are just exercising their inherent treaty right to fish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290221">In spite of domestic acts of terrorism, which included burning down a Mi'kmaq lobster fishery compound, there has been little response or action by the RCMP to protect Mi'kmaq fishers and their communities from further domestic terrorism. We have seen the assaults on Chief Sack. We have seen elders being abused. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290222">It is horrific for us as Canadians to watch what is happening. We have been waiting for the federal government to uphold the rule of law with appropriate actions to protect this constitutionally protected, inherent treaty right of the Mi'kmaq people to fish, but instead—</ParaText>

The reason I bring that forward is that they have been to court. In 2009, the Supreme Court sided with them on their right to catch and sell fish. Nine years later, after constant repeated appeals by the Conservative and Liberal governments, which did everything they could to stonewall, Judge Garson, the judge at the time, said:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Overall, however, Canada through DFO has the responsibility to represent the honour of the Crown. The lack of a mandate and Ottawa’s stonewalling of suggestions for advancing the development of a right-based fishery are significant factors in the failure of the process to move forward. Ottawa failed to allow the Regional staff to engage meaningfully and wholeheartedly in the Negotiations, at least until the Supreme Court of Canada refused leave the second time. As the plaintiffs repeatedly pointed out, there is no evidence before the court of any engagement by Ottawa staff on this fishery, other than the occasional signature on a Briefing Note, and reference to one meeting with a ministerial assistant which was not coordinated with local managers.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6290231">This is what Judge Garson stated about the Ahousaht Indian Band and Nation v. Canada in 2018. That is just an example of the minister sending her negotiators to the table, knowingly empty-handed, to deal with it. Whether it be Marshall, Sparrow, Gladstone or Ahousaht, these court cases that protect treaty and aboriginal rights, the government constantly sends its negotiators to the table empty-handed. This is affirmed by Judge Garson. What we need is the government to come to the table with a mandate to negotiate so that first nations can assert their rights, and the government needs to accommodate those rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290232">These indigenous communities, whether it be the Sipekne'katik, the Ahousaht or these other nations, are in these conflicts in the courts, which are costing taxpayers millions and millions of dollars fighting them, instead of getting them out on the water fishing, where they want to be, alongside the commercial fishers, so that they can feed their families. Instead, the government is fighting them every step of the way, knowingly. They need to be able to go out on the water and fish and be safe in exercising their rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290233">Today, we are asking the government to provide that safety and to come to that table with a meaningful mandate for justice, so that those perpetrators of the violence that took place in Mi'kmaq territory are held to account. We have been asking for the government to provide security and safety to the people of those communities, in support of Chief Sack and his community. Instead, we keep getting lip service from the government. I am so appalled at the delays from the government in the response. It is a miracle that nobody has died as a result of the inaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290234">We have heard the government say the RCMP will be enforcing and supporting with protection, but when we talk to people from the RCMP, they say that the DFO is responsible on the water. We talked to people from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and they say that they are not equipped and prepared to protect fishers on the water and that it is RCMP. These gaps need to be clarified tonight. We are looking for answers. These communities are looking for answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290235">The <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">indigenous services minister</Affiliation> said that we were let down by police and threw the RCMP under the bus, but no, Canada was let down by that minister, the cabinet, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada and the Government of Canada. He cannot absolve responsibility and just download it onto the RCMP or other departments. His responsibility is to provide federal support so that first nations have the safety to implement and exercise their constitutionally and treaty-protected rights. I am appalled.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290236"> This is also an issue of international concern. Article 20 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states, “1. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and develop their political, economic and social systems or institutions, to be secure in the enjoyment of their own means of subsistence and development, and to engage freely in all their traditional and other economic activities.” This has not been upheld. Canada should be ashamed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290237">We want to know what the plan is. We have been asking for weeks. The nation has been asking for weeks. We want a commitment from the government that they will come to the table with a meaningful mandate to accommodate their right to a moderate fishery. We want to know the government is going to come to the table with a meaningful mandate for the other cases that are before the Government of Canada in all indigenous rights, so that they are not being subjected to these violations of the United Nations declaration and international law, never mind violations of the Constitution of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290238">I hope the government comes to the table quickly so that we can heal as a country and come together and fish alongside each other and support this moderate livelihood through and through.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6290261">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his words and my colleagues for their support of this very important debate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290262">We all saw the heartbreaking images, the incredibly intimidating images, and frankly, the terrorism and violence perpetrated against indigenous people. We saw the images of indigenous people, the Mi'kmaq people, being physically assaulted, bullied, intimidated and threatened. The threats were to burn the facilities, and then those facilities were burnt down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290263">I ask everyone in the House to consider if those same threats had been made against someone who was not indigenous, in a non-indigenous community. If someone came in, physically assaulted and threatened them, and threatened to burn down their livelihood, would there have been no action in the same way there was no action when it happened to the Mi'kmaq people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290264">If those types of threats were made against anyone else, would the police have stood by and let it happen? If those types of threats were made against any other community, would there be a complete lack of protection for that community? The answer is very clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290265">In this circumstance, indigenous people are supported by a Supreme Court decision and a right, a constitutional, treaty-protected right, to live off the land. That right was hard won in court 21 years ago. Still, to this day, they have not had a federal government, any federal government, Liberal or Conservative, willing to do the work to ensure they have access to that right. It has been 21 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290266">We have heard from ministers. The reason we are having this emergency debate is to make the Liberal government do something about it. There has been a court decision for over two decades, yet neither a Conservative government nor a Liberal government have done anything to ensure that the decision that was made is now implemented into law, or that the Mi'kmaq people were able to follow the ruling of the court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290267">Neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals have done anything. We will hear from the Conservatives, while they point the finger at the Liberals, and Liberals will say they are going to do something. It has been 21 years, and nothing has been done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290268">We want answers today. We want commitments today. This is an emergency because, as previous speakers have said, there is a real threat that this violence will escalate and people will lose their lives. That cannot happen. We need immediate action right now. We need a clear plan. We need a plan so that the Mi'kmaq people will be protected, their livelihood will be protected and the violence will end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290269">We need a clear plan that lays out an immediate course of action. We heard from the chief specifically related to where this violence has occurred. The chief said that they do not want a long-drawn-out process. Those in the indigenous community have also made it very clear that what it means to be able to exercise their rights should not be a decision imposed upon them. The indigenous community should be at the table to determine that, based on the evidence and the science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290270">However, as previous speakers have said, there is no question here that there is any threat to conservation. The scale the Mi'kmaq fisheries operation is in no way a risk to conservation. Any suggestion that this is about conservation is wrong. It is clearly an ongoing example of systemic racism. Indigenous people have a constitutional right that has been upheld in court to earn a living. When that right is not implemented into law and is not supported, then the question of conservation comes up. This is not about conservation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290271">This is about indigenous people who have a right, and that right has been violated. That right has been threatened. They need protection, and they need the protection they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290272"> We need some clear answers from the government. What is the timeline? How quickly will the government act to make sure what was determined to be a constitutional right, which has been upheld in court, is now put through a clear process to move forward? How quickly can that definition be determined?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290273">We need timelines. We need a clear plan of action to protect the Mi'kmaq people. We need to see a clear plan to protect them in the fisheries operations on land and in water. We need to ensure that there is no more violence or intimidation against the Mi'kmaq people. It has to end. The violence must end. The fact that anyone feels that they can in any way be emboldened to physically intimidate, threaten violence and set fire to the indigenous communities' fisheries is a responsibility that lies squarely at the feet of the Liberal government and the Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290274">Inaction led to this, and the only way out of this is by clear action led by the indigenous community that is impacted, in this case the Mi'kmaq. We also have to look at all of the other examples. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252992" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation> pointed out countless decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada that have affirmed the rights of indigenous communities. To this day, in some cases years, in some cases decades, there have been so many cases where the exact same scenario has unfolded, where rights have been affirmed and the Supreme Court has said yes, the indigenous community has the right, title, claim or the ability to earn a living off of this land, yet the federal government has not done what it takes to make sure that right is translated into some meaningful action for people. This is an ongoing trend, and it has to end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290275">This debate is about getting answers for the people, protecting indigenous communities and changing the way things have been going on for so long. The process in the past has ignored and neglected indigenous communities. They have been failed again and again. This is another failure of the federal government toward indigenous people, and this has to end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290276">What New Democrats are calling for is very clear, and I hope to hear some answers at the end of this debate from the federal government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal cabinet ministers. We need a clear plan of action. The Mi'kmaq people deserve it. They deserve dignity and respect. These are the basic things that have been denied them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290277">We are seeing these painful images. I have heard from so many indigenous community members who are talking about the fear they live with and the threats they receive. We heard a local chief talking about the threats they get on social media, text message threats and threats from people calling anonymously. No one should have to live like that. This is the reality that Mi'kmaq people are faced with, but it is, sadly, not uncommon. This is a reality that so many indigenous communities are faced with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290278">We are looking for answers. We want answers and we want action. We want an action plan to protect this community, to ensure their right is upheld and there is a clear path to achieving it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290279">In closing, Mr. Speaker, I believe if you seek it, you would find unanimous consent for the following motion. I move that the House (a) affirm its respect for the treaty and inherent rights of the Mi'kmaq and the Maliseet people affirmed in the 1752 treaty, confirmed in the Canadian Constitution and in the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in the 1999 Marshall case; (b) recognize the Mi'kmaq nation deserves full and equal protection by the law from violence, intimidation and domestic terrorism; and (c) recognize the failure of the federal government to respect its nation-to-nation relationship to negotiate with the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet people, and to accommodate a “moderate livelihood” fishery, has led to the crisis we are facing today.</ParaText>

If the member opposite wants to talk about condemning violence, which we should and which most Canadians do, then we have to look at where this violence came from. What is the cause of this? The cause is that, for 21 years, a Supreme Court decision that called on the federal government to take action to defend and protect the rights of indigenous people was not acted on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290289"> Therefore, the responsibility lies squarely at the feet of, right now, the federal Liberal government, and at the feet of the previous Conservative government. That is who is responsible for the fact that we have violence right now. This is a question that was not addressed by either government. This was a legal question that was established in law, but then the federal governments, both Liberal and Conservative, did not act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290290">Because of that inaction, we are now faced with this tension.

              <ParaText id="6290293">Mr. Speaker, in response to that question, I ask a question of everyone in the House and to all Canadians who are listening. Imagine working in a community and a person's livelihood, what they rely on to put food on the table for their family and kids, is threatened by somebody. Those threats were specific: someone threatened to set fire to their place of work, where they earn a living for their family. What would the police response be? How would they feel if, after receiving that type of threat, being physically intimated and assaulted, their place of work was then set ablaze and they came to work and saw that it was destroyed? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290294">That is what is going on here. It is absolutely an example of systemic racism in our policing. By the fact that the federal Liberal and Conservative governments have not acted to protect the Mi'kmaq people for over 21 years, they are also exhibiting the same behaviour of neglect and ignoring people who deserve respect and dignity, who fought for it and who won it in court but are not receiving it from governments.</ParaText>

That is why the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> approved a request from the province on Friday for more police resources to be deployed in order to keep the peace so the Nova Scotia RCMP can effectively do their job.</ParaText>

That is why we will work with commercial fishers and Canadians to ensure this is done fairly. I understand this is challenging. This is not an inconvenience, but an obligation. If we are truly to be the country we like to think of ourselves as, then this is the road we must walk together.</ParaText>

In his remarks he said that the real work of reconciliation should be driving a solution here. I agree, but the trouble is that he has been Prime Minister for five years and he has violated the duty to consult indigenous Canadians on two separate occasions, with the cancellation of northern gateway and the Arctic exploration treaty with the United States. Not a single Inuit or indigenous community was consulted on that.</ParaText>

For four of those years, every member of Parliament in Atlantic Canada was a Liberal MP. There has been five years of inaction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290311">My question for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is this. When is the real work going to begin? I mentioned to the Prime Minister a month ago, before Parliament reconvened, that tensions were rising. The Liberals ignored it then. The minister from the province ignored it for a year. Therefore, why has there not been substantive mediation between the Mi'kmaq and the commercial fishermen?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6290326">Mr. Speaker, I am joining the House from Mi’kma’ki, the traditional and unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq people. Today, we are discussing very important issues: the escalating violence in Nova Scotia and the Mi'kmaq treaty rights to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290327">I am here not only as the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, but as a Nova Scotian and as a lifelong member of the rural coastal community. I know how important the fishery is to families and communities, to our neighbours and our friends who head out on the waters to make a living. It is a way of life here. It is part of our culture as Nova Scotians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290328"> We have all witnessed the terrible rise of tensions and violence on the east coast. The events that have occurred over the past week with the violence, the fires, the racism are disgusting. I know that Canadians across the country feel this way too and that the current situation in Nova Scotia cannot continue. There is no place for the threats, for the intimidation or for the vandalism that we have witnessed. I wholeheartedly condemn these actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290329">The escalating tensions in southwest Nova Scotia highlight the issues around the implementation of the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet and Peskotomuhkati historical treaty rights to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. They are a stark reminder that we must continue to do more and to work together. I cannot emphasize more the need for respectful dialogue and respect for treaty rights as we work toward a peaceful resolution. I would also note that procedurally we are all partaking in an emergency debate in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290330">The Mi'kmaq have a right to fish, a Supreme Court-affirmed treaty right. I want to be clear that we are not here to debate that tonight. We are here because our country operated for centuries without considerations of first nations' rights. We built up whole systems, institutions and structures without considering them. I want all parliamentarians who participate in this discussion and those at home watching and listening to know that we have an opportunity to change this. There are people out there who are committing criminal acts, and that is deplorable, but today's discussion is not even about them. It is about how we can all be part of the solution and work to help support a sustainable and productive fishery for all harvesters, first nations and commercial fishers alike. I truly believe that a fully realized, fully implemented right to fish for a moderate livelihood will only serve to strengthen our fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290331">We must also continue our efforts to de-escalate the situation by engaging all parties in constructive dialogue. On that front, my hon. colleagues and I have met regularly with both indigenous leadership and the fishing industry. We will continue to do so even once this crisis has passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290332"> During these discussions we have heard from both parties. We have heard frustration that the negotiations have taken too long and that there is a lack of real progress to implement this right. From non-indigenous harvesters, we have heard their concerns about the future of the fishery and their livelihood. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290333">Over the past few months, we have, without a doubt, all been dealing with an unprecedented health crisis on top of this. Many of the fishers have had a very challenging season. I know harvesters are worried, particularly when the opposition continues to try to pit them against others, making this a “them versus us”, saying that they should be concerned about the future of our stocks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290334"> Therefore, let me be clear. The conservation underpins everything we do. Lobster stocks are healthy and DFO will continue to monitor stocks and will never move forward with a plan that threatens the health of this species. I know that this approach is shared with many first nations leaders with whom I speak on a regular basis. I will continue to make every effort with the industry to increase transparency, formalize the lines of communication and ensure that the industry has meaningful opportunities to share its concerns and to express its views.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290335">This government unequivocally recognizes the right of the Mi'kmaq, the Maliseet and the Peskotomuhkati to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. This right stems from the Peace and Friendship Treaties of 1760 and 1761, and was confirmed over 20 years ago through the landmark Supreme Court Marshall decision in 1999. Since then, successive governments, both Liberal and Conservative, have launched programs and initiatives in an effort to accommodate what the court found to be a communal right to pursue a moderate livelihood from hunting, gathering and fishing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290336"> Programs over the past 20 years have provided support to purchase licences, vessels and gear and training in order to increase and diversify the participation in the commercial fishery and to contribute to the pursuit of a moderate livelihood for members. While there has been progress, more definitely needs to be done. We recognize that there are still income gaps between indigenous and non-indigenous communities in Atlantic Canada. The violence that we have seen over the past week is a reminder that there is still more work to be done, work that we can do together as part of reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290337">Indeed, it is under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who made reconciliation a top priority for our government. We have multiple ministers and departments working on this matter. Reconciliation is a whole-of-government mandate for us, and that work is led by the Prime Minister. Myself, my department and the government remain committed to working with first nations leaders to implement their treaty right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290338">I want to stress, once again, that our government's priority remains, first and foremost, the safety of everyone involved. This has to be a common objective for all. RCMP presence in southwestern Nova Scotia has been increased, and investigations are under way related to the events over the last few days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290339">As minister and as a government, we have the responsibility to ensure the safety of all Canadians and to see that those living in Canada are protected. This past September marked 21 years since the anniversary of the Marshall decision. It is time we made real progress forward on implementing the Mi'kmaq treaty right, and I am committed to making sure that we get this right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290340">We can all agree that reconciliation is a Canadian imperative. Each and every one of us has a role to play. It is only by working together that we can achieve that goal. We are here. We have an opportunity to bridge the divisions in our community, to have first nations and commercial harvesters fishing alongside each other, and this is achievable. This will strengthen our fishery.</ParaText>

It could have helped avoid an emergency debate if we had had a government that was more seized with this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290360">Let me be clear off the top about two distinct issues. Burning down buildings is always a crime. Destroying property is always a crime. Whoever commits crimes should be held accountable under the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290361">There is a second point I would like to make. The very fact that the government joined an opposition party that was going to raise this emergency debate is a sign. They are calling for an emergency after five years of their own inaction on this issue. It is quite unusual for a government to call for an emergency debate on a domestic issue that it has had carriage of for five years. In fact, we tried to get research done on this point and I think, but I cannot be sure, it has never happened. Usually emergency debates would be called with respect to international issues the government is not able to lead on. However, with the Liberal government, there is rarely leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290362">There are two Marshall decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada, but many Canadians may not know that and many members of this House may not know that. The decisions affirmed the right of first nations communities to earn a moderate livelihood from the fishery, but they also affirmed the Canadian rules related to conservation and the system around regulation were to be respected, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290363">The aboriginal right is paramount. In our Constitution, in our duty to reconciliation, it is critical. In the 21 years since Marshall, there have been governments of many stripes that have not been able to get this right. When fishing is happening out of season or when we do not have a properly regulated season and regulatory process for a fishery, that can deteriorate the stocks and deteriorate the economic potential of the region, non-indigenous and indigenous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290364">What is interesting right now is that the sides of this debate, the indigenous community and non-indigenous community, both agree on one thing: The inaction of the Liberal government is unacceptable. We have had some suggesting that a peacekeeping operation is needed and that should tell members that the situation is troubling. Everyone involved in this issue deserves the respect and attention of the government and it is the Liberals' inaction on this that has led to escalating tension and violence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290367">Before Parliament even met, before I had the honour of taking my seat as the leader of Canada's founding party, over a month ago, on September 18, I raised this issue personally with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, because for months my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, other Canadians, indigenous leaders, the commercial fishery, and union leaders have been raising concerns about rising tensions. That is why I raised this directly with the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290368">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">fisheries minister</Affiliation> to mediate and exercise political courage.

No wonder there is frustration in all of Canada, but particularly in Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290369">For weeks, members on this side of the House have been sounding notice and caution, asking the Liberal government to act. We have asked questions more than seven times in the House and dozens of times in the media. We had to do that because for months the government has preferred to sit back and wait, hoping the problem might go away by itself. Sadly, much as we are seeing now with the second wave of the pandemic, these things do not go away. They require leadership, and we have a government that prefers photo ops over follow-ups, hashtags over real work. Hoping that problems will go away is not leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290370">The <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries</Affiliation> let this situation escalate, and that has led to the tensions we have seen in recent days. Today, her inaction led to a press conference where not one but two of four ministers were present to acknowledge that they let the situation spiral out of control. Rather than getting people to the table, they were agreeing with another opposition party that there is an emergency they helped create, a sad expression of leadership by a government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290371">As we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tonight, the Liberals have also preferred to brand this dispute as an entirely racial conflict. The truth is that there are some unacceptable examples of racism, but there are also unresolved negotiations because of a personal debate over livelihood: indigenous livelihood and the well-being of those Canadians and their families, and the livelihood of many commercial fishers. As the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> herself said, in her province of Nova Scotia it is part of the culture. She seems to have allowed this to drag on to a point where we are now seeing violence, and Canadians are concerned about that. This is less about the way they are described and more about a failure to mediate and come to an agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290372">That is where leadership is needed. It is hard, but that is what the Conservatives have been asking for months. It is made worse by the fact than in this pandemic, all families, indigenous and non-indigenous, are worried about providing for their family. The government should have known that these tensions were rising. It could have shown leadership, but instead it framed this as tension brought on purely by racial elements. That is not truly the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290373">This is a dispute where constitutional fishery rights must be upheld for our indigenous Canadians. However, there is also concern from commercial fishers, their union leaders and their community and civic leaders that if this is not done right and conservation is not respected, then the fishery that has been taking place for centuries, which is, as the minister said, part of the culture, could disappear, along with the well-being and livelihoods of many people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290374">That is why we need to find a solution. That is why I raised this with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That is why the member for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> has been raising it time and time again. We need both sides to negotiate to find common ground, with a mediated solution and long-term plan for the well-being of all Canadians, indigenous and non-indigenous. Rather than recognizing the impacts of inaction, the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> prefers to throw up her hands and agree with another political party that it is an emergency happening under her watch. The Liberals would rather have a debate here than to have brought people to the table months ago. That is why Nova Scotians are watching, including my own family, which is from Fall River, Nova Scotia. This has gripped the entire region and country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290375">It is harder to show leadership by showing a path to a mediated long-term outcome, so instead the government prefers more talk, press conferences with ministers and calling this an emergency when it had five years. For four of those years, every single MP in that region was a Liberal MP. Instead of making this a priority, the Liberals were taking away the Atlantic Supreme Court justice, for example, until we stood up to that.</ParaText>

The first decision of the Supreme Court was with respect to the aboriginal right, a constitutional treaty in origin. It said we must respect that; it is important. The second decision said that the government can regulate for conservation and for regulatory structure. That is why for five years the government could have been finding a solution that would have respected our Constitution, would have respected the indigenous right, would have respected the local community and impact on the long-term viability on the fishery, and would have respected the legacy of Donald Marshall, which all Atlantic Canadians and all Dalhousie law graduates certainly know and remember.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290387">Mr. Speaker, I want to start by denouncing the violence happening in my region, in southwestern Nova Scotia, in the Clare and St. Marys Bay areas. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6290388">Everything we have been seeing to date is happening in the riding of West Nova. I wish I were not here talking about this tonight. I wish there were a solution at hand that was brought forward days, months or years ago to solve the issue of moderate livelihood for indigenous people. During that process, I would have thought there would have been some consultation along the way with the people of West Nova whose lobster fishery is being affected by this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290389">This has been happening for weeks. This has been happening for months. At least two months ago, I wrote my first letter to the minister underlining the issue that is before us. I have asked questions in the House. I brought it up in my debate to the address in reply. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290390">Finally, now that these threats have been thrown around and the violence has become too much, people seem interested in what is happening in West Nova. Where were the other MPs? One would have thought that at some point I would have received a phone call from someone asking what the situation really means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290391"> What is causing the problem we are seeing in West Nova? I can tell the House that the people I represent are scared and worried about what is happening in their communities. They are wondering what is going to happen next in their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290392">Before I get to the current situation, I want to ask the minister and the people who are speaking here today to please not paint my area as racist. There are probably a few, as in many of our ridings. It is true there is systemic racism in Canada, but my area is not racist by default. That does not represent the majority of my citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290393">Let us talk about where this starts. I know I do not have enough time to talk about all the things I really want to talk about regarding where the current situation is going, but the concern of an illegal fishery in St. Marys Bay has been known by the DFO for many years, with some natives and non-natives involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290394">We just need to look at the recent case of Sheng Ren Zheng of China, who was charged in Nova Scotia back in August for selling indigenous lobsters. Residents in the community of Clare tell me that this is still going on. The DFO and the RCMP need to continue these investigations and make public the information from them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290395">That extra illegal activity has been affecting the local lobster stock by about 60%. The people of Clare are very worried about retaliation. To date they have been very quiet about this, but it is one of many points of discussion that is not about the current situation of moderate livelihood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290396">The Marshall decision and the treaty rights are accepted by local fishers in the area, but, as it will affect their livelihood, they should be consulted, and it should be discussed with them at the base. Marshall 2 and subsequent fisheries committee, the FOPO committee, led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252509" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> at the time, was very expressive in including all participants in discussions to define what a moderate livelihood fishery actually is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290397">I guess the DFO needs to learn that consultation requires listening, not just talking, which is all it seems to do. I have heard it from the minister a number of times already. I have talked to fishers. She has made a couple of phone calls. She does not really understand what their concerns are, or at least it has not been shown that she knows what the core of this discussion really is.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="30">(2030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290398">I made a number of points in my letter about the Marshall decision, what the Marshall decision is and what it is not. I thought I raised probably the one point that is in here, but the letter is available on my website. First and foremost, the court claims that it did not hold that the Mi'kmaq treaty right could not be regulated, nor that the Mi'kmaq were guaranteed an open season in the fisheries. That is paragraph two of the Marshall decision. The court emphasized that the treaty right had always been subject to regulation, and the government's power to regulate the treaty right had been repeatedly affirmed in the September 17, 1999, majority judgment. That is paragraph 24 of the Marshall decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290399">There are a number of suggestions of what the Marshall decision is and what it is not. Most fishers and most associations that I have talked to accept the decision of Marshall 2. They look forward to negotiation, discussion and consultation when it comes to this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290400">I also hear from the minister about the nation-to-nation negotiation, and that there is no seat for commercial fishers at the table. I am okay with that. Commercial fishermen are okay with that as well, but in most negotiations there is always a second consultation table where experts sit so they can go back and confirm what they are thinking and what they are not thinking. As a matter of fact, in the recent negotiation with the United States, nation-to-nation, on NAFTA, we know that Jerry Dias was sitting at the table with the negotiators representing workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290401">The workers in the fishing community, which is the base of all of our economic activity in West Nova, just want to be able to sit at the table, to be part of that negotiation and to be able to provide a moderate livelihood for their families as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290402">There are tensions on all sides. Not everyone is subject to this, but I have seen threats from all sides. Tensions need to be brought down. I spend my days talking to fishermen and telling them to stand down while negotiations are ongoing, and quite honestly, I am getting very tired of it. I ask for everyone's help to continue to bring down this pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290403">This morning at a rally in Barrington, the previous minister of fisheries in Nova Scotia Sterling Belliveau said something important that worries me. He said, “If you're not at the table, you're probably on the menu” and today my fishers are really worried that, because they are not being consulted and they are not at the table talking about things, their industry is on the menu.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290404">I am looking forward to getting calls from all my colleagues wondering what is going on in the fishery in Nova Scotia, but I need the minister to step up. I need her to be here on the ground. I need her to meet with fishermen, both indigenous and non-indigenous as well. As a matter of fact, I have a truck and I am more than happy to pick her up, drive her down and keep her safe while we have these discussions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290418">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise this evening to speak to this emergency debate on the escalating violence against indigenous fishers. I want to say that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252929" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290419">I cannot begin my speech without first strongly condemning the criminal acts that have been committed in Nova Scotia, and the hatred and racism levelled at the Mi'kmaq people that we have seen lately. Absolutely nothing justifies this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290420">On September 17, as we already know, indigenous fishers launched their lobster fishing season in St. Mary's Bay, Nova Scotia. Ever since, there has been a growing number of confrontations, acts of vandalism, assaults, fires and much more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290421">Fishers from the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet nations have treaty rights that were confirmed by a Supreme Court of Canada ruling in 1999. The Marshall decision recognized the right of indigenous peoples to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood, while abiding by federal regulations. However, the Supreme Court never defined the limits of livelihood fishing, which continues to be a source of contention with non-indigenous fishers to this day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290422">It is rather unfortunate that this government's and its predecessors' negligence has caused the situation to deteriorate to the point of the present crisis. If governments had not dragged their heels on this matter, things would not have gotten this bad and we would not be here talking about it. It is deplorable that one fisheries and oceans minister after another, including the current one, has failed to act on the Marshall decision by implementing a regulatory framework negotiated nation to nation that respects constitutional treaty rights and the need to conserve the resource.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290423">In the Marshall decision, the Supreme Court recognized the Mi'kmaq people's commercial fishing rights arising from a 1760 treaty with the British. Previous rulings affirmed that this right terminated in the 1780s, but the Supreme Court determined that the Mi'kmaq right to subsistence fishing remained a treaty right within the meaning of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290424">In its second decision, which was rendered in November 1999, the Supreme Court set out the terms of its first decision and found that the federal and provincial governments have the authority, within their respective legislative fields, to regulate the exercise of a treaty right where justified on conservation or other grounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290425">The Marshall judgment referred to the Supreme Court's principal pronouncements on the various grounds on which the exercise of treaty rights may be regulated. The paramount regulatory objective is the conservation of the resource, and responsibility for it is placed squarely on the minister responsible and not on the indigenous or non-indigenous users of the resource. The regulatory authority extends to other compelling public objectives, which may include economic and regional fairness, and recognition of the historical reliance upon, and participation in, the fishery by non-indigenous groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290426">Indigenous people are entitled to be consulted about limitations on the exercise of treaty and indigenous rights. In other words, it is up to the federal government, more specifically the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation>, to implement regulations to ensure the prosperity and conservation of the resource in consultation with indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290427">The Liberals have now been in power for five years, not counting the other years they have been in power since 1999, of course. Why have they not yet created regulations? That is their responsibility. As a result of the government's inaction, we now find ourselves once again faced with a conflict between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. Despite a Supreme Court of Canada decision, the federal government has been unable to come up with a framework for implementing it in the more than 20 years since it was handed down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290428">I read an interesting Radio-Canada article this morning that quoted Martin Papillon, director of the Research Centre on Public Policy and Social Development at the University of Montreal. He corroborated what I just said when he stated:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290463">Mr. Speaker, I must reiterate that the Bloc Québécois strongly condemns the crimes committed in Nova Scotia and the acts of hatred and racism against the Mi'kmaq that we have witnessed recently. In particular, my colleagues and I feel it is deplorable that DFO and successive governments, including the current one, have failed to uphold the Marshall decision by implementing a regulatory framework negotiated nation to nation that respects constitutional treaty rights and the need to conserve the fisheries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290464"> We also condemn the inaction of successive governments, including this one, which has caused the situation to deteriorate and led to the present crisis. Many things could have been accomplished long before now. I sent the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation> a letter about this, urging her to finally define a moderate livelihood fishery. That could provide a concrete solution to the current conflict raging both in Nova Scotia and in various indigenous communities elsewhere in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290465">Despite what we are hearing from the ministers concerned about police inaction regarding the acts perpetrated, it is not just about what the police did or did not adequately do in the current situation. There has been tension between indigenous and non-indigenous fishers for more than 20 years. Yes, I recognize that the escalating violence has led to an emergency debate, but the issue of the regulation of fishing rights arising from the Marshall decision did not seem to be one of the government's most urgent concerns in its last throne speech, nor even last year or in the previous four years. Resolving this issue was not even included in the mandate letter of the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation> in the last parliamentary session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290466">Must we wait for acts of violence such as those we have seen in Nova Scotia to take action? In my riding of Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia there is also tension between indigenous and non-indigenous fishers, and I believe that is the case in many other places. Fortunately, there has been no violence in my riding, but we must take action now to prevent these types of incidents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290467">The <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation> tweeted this past weekend that her government would continue to work with the Mi'kmaq to implement their treaty rights. However, this crisis has been going on for over a month, and as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252552" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> rightly pointed out, it goes back much further than that. Where has the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation> been all along? What has she done to ease tensions? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290468">This problem did not begin with the violent outbursts we have seen in southwestern Nova Scotia since the lobster fishery opened on September 17. The government is clearly having a hard time finding solutions in collaboration with the first nations, given that, as I mentioned, it has been 21 years since the Marshall decision and the situation is still not resolved. In a press conference this morning, four Liberal ministers denounced the lack of a police response to the intimidation and violence being perpetrated by non-indigenous fishers against Mi'kmaq fishers in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290469">Rather, I think we need to take a closer look at Ottawa's tendency to drag its feet, as we have heard over the last few minutes, when it comes to first nations claims in general. Yes, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself condemned the violence in Nova Scotia and added that he and his government would continue to work towards reconciliation with first nations, but essentially, we know that no real progress is being made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290470">Now is the time for concrete action and clarity on the regulations. I think that is what we are really talking about here tonight. The federal government's unwillingness to resolve the matter and take responsibility for its decisions is what is preventing harmonious relations in the fishing areas shared by the indigenous and non-indigenous fishers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290471">This reminds me of a situation very similar to that of Nova Scotia. The lobster fishery in the community of Listigouche in the riding I represent, and where Fisheries and Oceans Canada has not been very clear on first nations' rights, remains a very contentious issue. Tensions are mounting among non-indigenous fishers because negotiations continue but nothing ever comes of them, either on the band council side or the fishers' association side. By deciding to manage its own fishing activities, the Mi'kmaq community is firmly reminding us of the impasse that indigenous and commercial fishers have been stuck in for 21 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290472">I would also like to look back on recent and not-so-recent history. This evening, several parliamentarians mentioned the right of indigenous peoples to fish for a moderate livelihood. This right was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada, but it is still surrounded by uncertainty, creating a lot of tension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290473">In 1999, a little more than 21 years ago, the Supreme Court made a decision in the Marshall case. It ruled that Donald Marshall, who was charged with illegally fishing eel outside the fishing season as set out by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, had the right to fish in accordance with the Peace and Friendship Treaties signed by indigenous peoples in the 18th century. The Supreme Court affirmed the right of indigenous peoples to hunt, fish and gather in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. <Sup /></ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290474">However, the concept of moderate livelihood was never defined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290475">A few months later, in November 1999, following protests by commercial fishers, the Supreme Court issued a clarification, known as Marshall II. It states that the federal and provincial governments have the power to regulate the fishery that indigenous people have the right to practise where justified on conservation or other grounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290476">Ever since, the first nations and DFO have been unable to agree on the definition of moderate livelihood. That is why the Mi'kmaq decided they would fish and sell their catch according to the regulations enforced by compliance officers. That is what happens when the government fails to put measures in place. The communities themselves define the measures that apply to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290477">Is it not the responsibility of the federal government, more specifically the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, to put regulations in place to ensure the prosperity and conservation of the resource, in consultation with indigenous and non-indigenous peoples? Again, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252552" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> asked this question earlier. Why is no one able to answer? Whose responsibility is this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290478">Last year, Listuguj fishers also defied the federal government by going out to sea in September to fish for lobster that they planned to sell rather than just distribute in their communities. The Mi'kmaq claimed they were within their rights because of the Marshall decision, but Fisheries and Oceans Canada considered their activities to be unauthorized commercial fishing. The Listuguj band council confirmed that DFO had refused to grant it a commercial licence for the fall fishery but had not explained why. That is often what people hear when they try to contact the department. They get little in the way of explanation, and sometimes no response at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290479">The first nation finally signed an agreement with the federal government last November, and that led to official negotiations on fishing rights, which are ongoing but are not actually making any headway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290480">If you try to please everyone, you will please no one. That is what is happening with a number of first nations issues. Just look at what is happening with moose hunting in the La Vérendrye wildlife reserve. The same is true in fishing zones in the Gaspé: Non-indigenous commercial fishers in the southern Gaspé are also angry because they feel unheard. For the past eight years, they have been calling on Fisheries and Oceans Canada to listen to them about the management of stocks, which necessarily involves the treaties negotiated with the first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290481">The Regroupement des pêcheurs professionnels du sud de la Gaspésie has been denied or simply ignored by the department. It has complained about being left out of negotiations, even though the changes made to the fishing plans affect all users of the same zone, including indigenous and non-indigenous fishers. The organization has also been critical of the agreements regarding independent fishing plans for the different communities, which it feels create inequalities. It says that two parallel fishing systems are being created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290482">According to the association, the government's actions go against its own lobster conservation laws, or efforts to reduce fishing to increase stocks, by increasing the number of traps allowed in certain areas and increasing the number of fishing licences, some of which are issued for the same areas fished by Gaspé fishers, in Chaleur Bay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290483">Indigenous and non-indigenous fishers likely do not agree, and it is the federal government's responsibility to draw the line. The government needs to clearly define livelihood fishing, invite all parties involved in managing the fishery to the table, come up with a licensing system and set out clear and transparent rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290484">Once again, we find ourselves caught in a conflict with the first nations because the government did not fulfill its responsibilities. When it comes right down to it, everyone wants the same thing: clear directives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290485">The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for enforcing the Canadian Navigable Waters Act. It must therefore have the necessary political courage to take a stand and put an end to 21 years of uncertainty and tension between indigenous and non-indigenous fishers. That is what this government is missing on several issues: political will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290486">A collaborative approach is critical to formulate a comprehensive agreement like the 2002 peace of the braves agreement between Quebec and the James Bay Cree. That could be a solution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290490">Both those issues have to be addressed: the right for a moderate livelihood and the conservation of the resource for both commercial fishermen and aboriginal fishermen. Would the member agree with that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290505">I am speaking to the House from my Toronto home, which is located on the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation. We honour all indigenous peoples who paddled these waters and whose moccasins walked this land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290506">To begin, I would like to thank the Mi'kmaq communities that have worked very hard to keep their members safe despite the escalation of violence. All Canadians were horrified by the violence inflicted on the Mi'kmaq people in recent weeks. They have been attacked and intimidated because they exercised their right.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="10">(2110)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6290507">With the destruction of property and attacks on people's attempt to obtain a moderate livelihood, unfortunately this escalation of tension has exacerbated divisions. No dispute can be settled through violence, and no durable solutions are found through threats and intimidation. It has to stop. Human rights and the treaty and inherent rights of indigenous peoples must be respected. That commitment is at the very heart of our country's very identity and enshrined in our Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290508">We have much more work to do to forward the unfinished business of Confederation. We need to accelerate the progress and we need all Canadians with us on this journey. Racist colonial policies have resulted in denied opportunity, sustained harassment and a justifiable mistrust in all of our institutions and civil society. Systemic racism is evident in all of our institutions and all Canadians need to know that it is their responsibility to end it. The Government of Canada is committed to a renewed relationship with indigenous people in Canada, nation to nation, Inuit to Crown, and government to government, built on the affirmation of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290509">It has been over 20 years since the Marshall decision reaffirmed the right of the Mi'kmaq to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. The court upheld the treaty right of Donald Marshall to fish. The court found that his treaty right was protected by the section 35 of the Constitution. The Mi'kmaq people have the right to exercise their rights, free from violence, threats and racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290510">Canada has reaffirmed our commitment to working in partnership with the Mi'kmaq to implement their treaty rights on the path to self-determination. Over the weekend, in our conversations with Chief Sack and the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs, we reassured them that we agree with them, that the safety of their communities is the priority, the violence is unacceptable and the perpetrators will be brought to justice. We heard their frustration with respect to the implementation of their right to a moderate livelihood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290511"> The Marshall decision was a long time ago, but it is not where this story starts. In 1760-61 the Crown signed peace and friendship treaties with the Mi'kmaq people, treaties that guarantee hunting, fishing and land-use rights for the descendants of these communities. These treaties are the foundation of our relationship and remain in place today. Canada, and all Canadians, have a responsibility to understand this and ensure that these treaties are upheld and implemented. To achieve this, Canada is currently engaged in discussions on aboriginal treaty rights and self-government with 10 of the 13 Mi'kmaq nations in Nova Scotia. We are also pursuing discussions with the remaining three communities, which are not involved at the self-determination table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290512">Implementing the historic treaty rights recognized in the Marshall decision is a critical component of these discussions and a priority for the Government of Canada. For millennia, indigenous people have held conservation and sustainability as a core value. The Mi'kmaq nation has been working hard on its plans to exercise and implement its rights in a sustainable fishery based upon science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290513">I am proud of the progress we are making together to affirm the treaty and inherent rights of first nations, Inuit and Métis on their path to self-determination. Together, we and our partners have transformed how government engages with indigenous people and how we work together. The renewed relationship has been furthered by the establishment of the recognition of indigenous rights and self-determination discussion tables, which represent a new flexible way to have the discussion of how to affirm the unique rights, needs and interests that matter most to indigenous communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290514">Since 2015, we have created over 90 new negotiation tables. There are currently over 150 active negotiation tables across the country to help advance the relationship with indigenous people and to support their version of self-determination. We are making significant progress at these tables, but we cannot move forward as a country without the understanding and support of all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290515">Part of the path forward was highlighted in the Speech from the Throne and that is the introduction and implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. UNDRIP is not scary. Implementation of the inherent and treaty rights of indigenous peoples is the way forward to a much stronger and fairer Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290516">The great challenges we have already endured in 2020 have presented us with a world that is in need of renewal. For Canadians, that renewal must begin with our longest lasting partnership. Our government is as determined to address historical injustice and racism born of colonialism, as we are determined to root out and expose racism today. Canadians have seen all too clearly during this difficult, tense time that racism, both systemic and societal, continues to be all too present in our country. The death of Joyce Echaquan has shown us this horrible truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290517">Once we know the truth, we cannot unknow it. June Callwood said that if someone is an observer of an injustice, that person is indeed a participant. All of us need to identify racism in all its forms and then speak up, call it out and be part of the concrete changes that will stop it. It must not and will not be tolerated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290518">The Government of Canada remains fully committed to supporting the Mi'kmaq right to fish and to maintain a moderate livelihood. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogues with the Nova Scotia chiefs to implement these rights. I am working closely with my colleague, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation>, toward a peaceful resolution and the advancement of Mi'kmaq rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290519">The Mi'kmaq leadership is inspiring. I am confident that we will be able to find a path forward together that affirms their right to fish and creates certainty so that the Mi'kmaq people are able to live with dignity and security, free from violence. A timely and peaceful resolution will make Nova Scotia and Canada stronger and fairer. <I>Wela'lin</I>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290539">Madam Speaker, I am joining the House today from the Eskasoni community, the Mi'kmaq community, the largest Mi'kmaq first nation in the heart of Mi'kma'ki, on the unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq. I rise today as the lone Mi'kmaq MP in the House, the only MP of Mi'kmaq descent this House has ever known, but also as someone who is part of a large fishing community. I told constituents that I would always look for collaborative solutions to the challenges we face in Canada. I have spoken to many stakeholders over the past month: Mi'kmaq fishermen, Mi'kmaq leaders and fishing associations, and the RCMP. I believe in my heart that there is room for all of us, and that we, together, can move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290540">Before I address the solutions that I would like to put forward, I would like to share a little about how we have come to this escalation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290541">Mi'kmaq values are ingrained in our language. <I>Netukulimk</I> tells us that in the Mi'kmaq world view, we are connected to our environment, not above it. Chief Seattle, who is not a Mi'kmaq, said it best: “Man did not weave the web of life—he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290542">With this in mind, I want to give a little treaty history. In 1605, our grand chief of the Mi'kmaq grand council, Henri Membertou, on the shores of Port-Royal in the southwest Nova Scotia area, welcomed French newcomers, took them under his wing and showed them how to survive in the area. This created a great friendship between the Mi'kmaq and the French. It was so great that in 1755, when the Acadians were being expelled, the Mi'kmaq hid them. The Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Arthur LeBlanc, told me a beautiful story about how his family was saved by the Mi'kmaq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290543">The Covenant Chain of Treaties within the Mi'kma'ki, from 1725 to 1778, began a process whereby the British Crown began negotiating with the Mi'kmaq. Early treaties between the Mi'kmaq and the Crown were based on peace, friendship and trade. The common misconception is that the Mi'kmaq gave away resources or surrendered resources. The Mi'kmaq were a fighting force. I want to quote a part of Donald Marshall's case, from 1999. It said, “It should be pointed out that the Mi’kmaq were a considerable fighting force in the 18th century. Not only were their raiding parties effective on land, Mi’kmaq were accomplished sailors.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290544">Subsection 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, says:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290545">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">(1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290546">That, together with the section 52 supremacy clause, means that aboriginal and treaty rights are the supreme law of Canada once recognized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290547">In 1985, the 1752 treaty was recognized in the Simon case, where it is said, “The Treaty was an exchange to solemn promises between the Micmacs and the King's representative entered into to achieve and guarantee peace. It is an enforceable obligation between the Indians and the white man”. That is their language, not mine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290548">Then we have the Marshall decision in 1999. I have heard members of the opposition quote one section of the clarification, instead of looking at all of the Mi'kmaq case law combined, and all of the case law in Canada. It is true that the Mi'kmaq were granted a moderate livelihood, not once but twice, in 1999. Today, the Mi'kmaq are asking for a right that they have always had. It was not created in 1999. In 1999, the court said that the right had existed the whole time. Mi'kmaq are not looking for reparations or revenge, but rather reconciliation, and this shows our commitment to the country and our allies. I want to remind people that the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that moderate livelihood not once but twice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290549">l have also heard a conversation about regulation in the fisheries. I want to be very clear that the Mi'kmaq right is constitutional in nature. That means it is the supreme law of Canada. The only way to infringe a treaty right is through conservation or safety. The 2005 Mikisew Cree First Nation case stated that before going to conservation or safety, we have to show that the honour of the Crown has been met in a negotiation or in any infringement that takes place. Any infringement must be compensated, and that has never happened to this day.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290550">Where are we today? What have we learned since 1999? Have we learned anything from the Burnt Church crisis? I remember watching the Burnt Church crisis as a young man, and I never thought that today we would have two Mi'kmaq senators appointed in the past five years, as well as a Mi'kmaq MP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290551">During this first escalation, which did not happen last week but in mid-September, I went to Saulnierville with the Grand Keptin of the Mi'kmaq Nation, Andrew Denny, the political spokesman of the Mi'kmaq Grand Council, which represents the seven districts of Mi'kma'ki. We talked to the Mi'kmaq fishermen, we talked to the RCMP and we talked to the community. What we saw was a perfect storm of frustration that has led us to where we are today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290552">We have seen 20 years of frustration through the non-implementation of the Marshall decision for sure, but we have also seen a really bad fishing season as a result of COVID, during which fishermen did not make what they usually make. Also, the Mi'kmaq who had traditionally gone down to the United States to be part of the blueberry harvest in Maine were not given the opportunity to make money there this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290553">I reached out to the Mi'kmaq senators and said that I believe we have the ability, as Mi'kmaq, to talk and figure out how we can move forward to find solutions. In a thorough discussion with not only ministers of our government but also people within the fisheries association and Mi'kmaq fishermen, we heard loud and clear from the chiefs that this is not a dispute about money and jobs and it is not a right they want to sell. It is a right they want to pass down to generations. It is about culture; it is about knowledge. What we heard is that the rights are not for sale and extinguishment, at any price, is not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290554">Therefore, what is the way forward? The Mi'kmaq have created great success, national success in fact. They have the highest graduation rate of any nation out there, at 90%, despite having a deplorable rate of children in poverty. The reason is that they have the ability to control their own jurisdiction in education. When Mi'kmaq hold each other accountable and Mi'kmaq have jurisdiction, they succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290555"> When we were looking at ways forward, the senators and I said that we needed to come up with principles moving forward. The first is sustainability for the future, or <I>Netukulimk</I>, which I talked about. We also need to look at implementation, not infringement or extinguishment of any right. We heard from the fisheries industry that there is fear out there, so we need to look at total transparency of the fisheries and work on a model that creates economic growth for Mi'kmaq and Maliseet in fisheries within the Atlantic. To me, it is hard to look those in my community in the eye when the rate of children in poverty is 75% in my community despite their having a right to earn a moderate livelihood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290556">We feel that these solutions are the best way forward, but I have heard questions in a lot of conversations so far: Why has this government not done more in five years? Why has this government not done it in 20 years? One of the biggest reasons is that people are not aware of the treaty rights. People are not aware of the treaty litigation that has been taking place. I was a treaty education lead for Nova Scotia before I ran for election. I remember something Nelson Mandela stated. He said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Creating awareness of treaties and indigenous history is key to moving forward. I believed this in my prior role in treaty education lead in Nova Scotia and I believe it today, but I also believe that the failures of one generation are the opportunities of the next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290557"> I am really proud to be standing here tonight, for the first time hearing debates about the Mi'kmaq fisheries, to join members as a Mi'kmaq member of Parliament. I am proud and thankful that members are taking part in this debate. I wanted to not only give them a chance to share in the history, but also give them opportunities to talk solutions. I know we all, at times, curse in the darkness, but I want to be the MP who tries to light the candle.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290574">Like many, I have become increasingly concerned over the last couple of weeks as we watched the escalating dispute and violence in Nova Scotia. As members may be aware, the Crown signed peace and friendship treaties in 1760 and 1761, and this of course included a right to fish, hunt and gather in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. These rights were affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Marshall decision of 1999, and there was further clarification on November 17, 1999, that this right was not unlimited and regulations could be introduced if it was justified for conservation or other important objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290575">It is important to note that history, and I know many have repeated it. This is a right that has been around for many long years and has been reaffirmed. The Sipekne’katik fishers in southwestern Nova Scotia launched a moderate livelihood fishery last month and protestors were concerned about this. Protests have become increasingly violent, with tensions rising. We have all been witness to some very dramatic footage over the last few days in particular, and of course we are very concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290576">This current dispute is a failure of the Crown, and in this case the Liberal government, which had promised to do better. Five years ago the Liberals were elected and had a majority government. They promised to do better. I have been in conversation with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> for many weeks, knowing he has been very concerned and has been calling for serious action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290577">What do we have instead of serious action? We have four ministers taking the unprecedented step of calling for an emergency debate. Do they not realize that they are government? They have the ability to resolve this crisis and they have the responsibility to be on plane, rather than being in the House. Lives and livelihoods are at risk and they matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290578">The minister has said there is a pandemic. The <Affiliation DbId="263833" Type="4">intergovernmental affairs minister</Affiliation> can have an exemption to do a meet-and-greet with the new Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador. I would suggest this is much more important. Not everything can be done by Zoom. Sometimes people have to be there and put that energy and time into saying that this is going to be resolved. They have to put some urgency to it. Let us not just talk about it in the House. The government is asking for a domestic debate on an issue it has the ability to resolve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290579">Canada must fulfill its obligation under the Marshall decision and a negotiation around what a moderate livelihood means is probably one of the important steps. The <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> must ensure Nova Scotia has the resources it requests to effectively manage the escalating tensions, fully investigate criminal activity and keep everyone safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290580">We all know Canadians have a right to peacefully demonstrate or protest. That is constitutionally protected. However, we are also a country of rule of law and those laws must be respected. Anyone who has crossed the boundary from peaceful protest to criminal activity must be held to full account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290581">Failed policies and unfinished business of successive generations truly is our shame and the results for indigenous people across Canada have been catastrophic for too many. We must do better. With realizations and court decisions, there is an understanding from Canadians from coast to coast to coast that we have much work to do toward reconciliation. Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, I have seen a real understanding from Canadians that we must do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290582">As we are working toward reconciliation and correcting the injustices of the past, we cannot create new injustices. The government needs to have a process that includes third parties in the conversation. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290583">I will go back to the treaty process in British Columbia in the 1990s. It was a very flawed process, but one of the things they did right was that they had five tables of people who had a special interest. Whether it was hunting and fishing or other areas, they had a special interest in terms of what was at the table. They created a win-win as opposed to a win-lose. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290584">That is certainly something that the government has not done. The Liberals go out to meet with the Wet'suwet'en and they do not bother to include the elected chiefs in the conversation. There are many examples where their failure to have a conversation with third parties, to let them know what was happening, why it was happening and perhaps seek some advice, has been to the detriment of communities that have worked and lived side-by-side for generations. Certainly I am very concerned with the current government's failure. In the past, there was a Liberal government that had a better process.</ParaText>

As I go about my work, there is something that I am very proud of and that I reflect upon often.

This was in the early 1900s, but the sentiment is something that we all need to look at. In B.C., we did not have treaties. There were many unresolved issues and they went to the government at the time. Some of the words that stand out in my memory are to the effect that:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290605">Madam Speaker, let me start by saying that the indigenous right to fish is without question and has been firmly established. As a member previously mentioned, all acts of violence and arson are wrong. They are a crime and must be dealt with by the proper authorities. The safety of all Canadians must be the priority of any government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290606">I also concur with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> when he clearly stated that these violent acts were wrong, as we have seen. They do not reflect in any way on the overwhelming majority of the good people of West Nova, who are hard-working, good members of their communities, residents and citizens of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290607">We find ourselves here today debating this issue because of the inaction of the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government. For weeks and months now, they have failed to act as tensions continue to rise in southwestern Nova Scotia. I have personally witnessed the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> plead on behalf of the residents of southwest Nova and ask the government to intervene, be part of a solution and take action. It is because of the minister's and the government's lack of action and their failure to take the necessary steps to find a peaceful resolution that we find ourselves in a place where neighbour has been pitted against neighbour and tensions have been rising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290608">When government should be stepping in and meeting with all stakeholders and community groups that have a part in this to come to a resolution and lower the temperature, the government has chosen the path of the politics of inaction, delay, defer and sometimes dither. This instead has added fuel to an ever-growing flame. The Liberal premier of Nova Scotia, just the other day said he was extremely disappointed by the federal response. He also added that this is only going to get more entrenched, and they need to be in the same room so everyone knows what each other is saying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290609">The rights of indigenous people are without question and firmly established. What is lacking is proper clarity from the government and proper consultation that incorporates representatives from all interested parties, including both indigenous and non-indigenous fish harvesters, local community leaders, union representatives and local authorities. There will be no true reconciliation until there is meaningful dialogue and understanding among all affected parties. True reconciliation cannot be achieved if whole communities and interested parties are isolated from the process. It is time that we sat down together. There is no path forward until we first sit together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290610">I echo the comments of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253096" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation>. She pointed out quite clearly that there has not been a sense of urgency around this. When government ministers should have been getting to the scene, engaging all of those who are directly affected and making sure we come to a peaceful solution, they delayed. They waited. They held back and there has been limited consultation and limited discussions. The dialogue has been far less than what any of us would have anticipated at this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290611">Any decision regarding this, as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252509" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> pointed out earlier in the discussion this evening, must have conservation top of mind and as a key part of this discussion. We need to make sure that there is going to be plenty of stock, lots of lobster and fish, in the sea for all to enjoy, both indigenous and non-indigenous, for many generations to come. The <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and her Liberal colleagues have repeated tonight, and throughout the last few days, how important conservation is in many of their discussions, yet we had the opportunity to discuss this today at the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290612">Even in those deliberations, when we brought forward an amendment to study the fisheries crisis and the issues that we are facing today, all of us on the opposition side voted for it to make sure that conservation was part of that consideration, but members on the governing side opposed that amendment and stood in the way of it. I do not think we can have a meaningful discussion about this without obviously making sure that conservation is part of that discussion and study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290613">Even though these are heavy times, and we are in the midst of facing a crisis that none of us want to see, all Canadians want to come together, find reconciliation and get to the future. I think it comes down to whether or not we are going to have a proactive type of leadership or reactive style of leadership. Right now, we find ourselves in a reactive place or state of leadership, rather than being proactive from the beginning, recognizing that tensions were escalating long ago and now working towards a solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290614"> There is so much potential within the fisheries. There is so much potential within the blue economy for Canada. We can realize that potential for both indigenous and non-indigenous fishers if we will sit at the table, come to a solution and work towards true reconciliation at this moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290615">Just this past week, I had the privilege of being in Prince Edward Island. I met with some local fish harvesters and heard about the potential of the blue economy, of what it could be if there were some strategic investment in marine infrastructure, and of what it would mean to the local communities and to our region here in Atlantic Canada. Instead, we find ourselves in crisis mode with all the emphasis, understandably, on this situation to find a resolution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290616">I have been reflecting a lot on this. As I heard very compelling testimony from all sides of the House, I found myself reflecting on an old story, an ancient one that goes back many years, and I am sure this story is familiar to some. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290617">This is the story of a wise old fisherman, the master fisherman as it were, who stood on the seashore one day. There were some fishermen who had fished all night out in a boat but had not caught any fish. The master fisherman looked at them and said, “Why don't you try again and let down your nets?” Of course, the fishermen said, “We fished all night and caught nothing. Nevertheless, you are the master fisherman, and at your word, we will do it.” So they went out and threw their nets out again, and they caught a tremendous amount of fish. In fact, they caught so many fish that their nets began to break and they had to call other fishermen and other boats to come over and help with the great harvest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290618">What stood out to me as I reflected on that story is that the challenge that the master fisherman gave to those seasoned, experienced fishermen who had been trying all night but had caught nothing was to try where they just had failed. He knew that they had fished all night and did not get results, but he told them to go once again and try where they had once failed. Of course, when they did that, they got a great harvest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290619">Perhaps there is a lesson here. I know for generations we have not done well with reconciliation. We have not gotten it right, and various governments of various stripes all have ownership of that, but we have an opportunity in this moment to get it right. Perhaps we need to listen to the words of the master teacher, the master fisherman who said, “Try again one more time.” If we try again one more time with the right heart, the right motive, and with all key stakeholders at the table, I have a feeling that just maybe we can get it right this time. We can embrace a blue economy, which has tremendous potential for Canada, for both the non-indigenous and indigenous fishers and harvesters who are out there. </ParaText>

I also noted that he used the terms “reactive” and “proactive” and stated that the government is reactive rather than proactive. I could not agree more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290627">This was evident during the rail crisis in January and February, when we saw how the government acted when dealing with the Wet'suwet'en people. The government took its time before meeting with them. Once again, I am wondering if this is part of the culture of the federal government. People in the federal government are not used to dealing with first nations on a nation-to-nation basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290628">I would like to give a short history lesson. On March 17, 1985, René Lévesque was the very first premier in Canada to recognize the first nations. It took a sovereignist to do this. He officially and expressly recognized the first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290629">We are still facing the same problem. I think that the problem is cultural. I would like to hear what my colleague thinks about that.

However, the government that was in power just before the Liberals was there for 10 years and it was a Conservative government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290644"> Chief Terrance Paul stated, in September of this year, “We are not taking anything away from others. We're just trying to get back what was taken from us.” I think this is at the crux of what is going on now. Twenty years ago, the Marshall decision reaffirmed the treaty right of the Mi'kmaq people to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood, and dialogue has been part of how we are working toward its implementation and we must continue the dialogue. That dialogue, I know, has been ongoing for the last several weeks because I have been in meetings with the chiefs and I am aware of what is going on. It is time. It should have happened a long time ago, but there is no better time than the present to redress the wrongs of the past and the time is now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290645">Our commitment to redefine the relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples was underscored in the Speech from the Throne. One of the core pillars of the new legislative agenda is walking the road of reconciliation, and that means combatting discrimination and working toward a better relationship and partnership with indigenous peoples and non-indigenous peoples across this country. We have a chance to create an environment that supports self-determination, self-governance and economic growth, and it must include the ceremonial and spiritual relationship that the Mi'kmaq have with fishing, hunting and gathering. Like most indigenous peoples around the world, we colonialists have much to learn from them about conservation and how to protect mother earth and her creatures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290646">The first nations in the Atlantic have proven time and again the power of partnership through a number of initiatives. When I say that, I am thinking about the Atlantic first nations health partnership. I am really encouraged by the strong first nations engagement in this co-management structure that is enabling them to improve first nations communities' health, and there is still much more to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290647">I am equally excited by the framework agreement signed last June for an indigenous-led water authority in Atlantic Canada, the first in this country. This framework agreement is an important step toward a fully autonomous first nation-led operation of water and wastewater services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290648">Another great example is the Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq education system. In 1997, the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia signed an agreement with nine Mi'kmaq communities, restoring their control over their education system. At the time, fewer than a third of youth from those communities finished high school, and today more than 90% of Mi'kmaq students graduate, which is higher than the average in most provinces. This is what is born of self-governance and self-determination. We must build on this renewed relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples and address past wrongs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290649">A recent example is the recognition of the Shubenacadie residential school site in Nova Scotia as a national historic site. Recognizing these schools and the experiences of former students and survivors of residential schools across Canada is important to the journey of self-healing. There was an elder here in Millbrook First Nation, Nora Bernard, who helped indigenous peoples receive recompense for this injustice, and I would like to pay my respects to her tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290650">Environmental racism is a huge problem across Canada, and I am very proud that I was able to introduce my private member's bill about that. It should be coming up for second reading soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290651">Tonight, we all think of what is going on in southwest Nova Scotia, but we must remember that this is about nation-to-nation talking, dialogue. It is time. It has taken too long to happen. I am glad that it has begun and we need to get it finished. We need to have peace on the water and peace on the land, so that this dialogue can be accomplished between the Mi'kmaq and the Crown. I am glad to be part of a government that is actually, finally doing that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290652">Mi'kmaq treaties and treaty rights across Canada are so important. The indigenous peoples of Canada have been lied to and deceived so many times, and my heart breaks for what they have lived through and for all of the years of abuse, ever since colonials came to this country. I am from Australia originally, and the same thing happened there, sadly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290653">Sadly, if people had listened to the indigenous peoples in the beginning, they would have looked after the land much better. That is why first nations people do not take too much from one place; they take some and they give back. They honour the land, they honour the creatures and they honour nature and the seasons of nature. They honour mother earth and Turtle Island. It is our time to listen to them and learn from them how best to look after the small reserves we have, which will get fewer and fewer if we are not careful. All we have to do is look across the world and see all the wildfires that are happening because man has not heeded the way things should be and looked after the land and the water the way that we should.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290654">The Government of Canada hopes to achieve what we began along the path of reconciliation, and we plan to introduce UNDRIP. I am looking forward to that. We committed to a renewed nation-to-nation, Inuit-to-Crown, government-to-government process with indigenous peoples across Canada to make real progress on the issues that are most important to them. We have already started down this path and we will keep walking together. It is in my heart and it is in my mind, and I pledge that I will do everything that I can as a member of Parliament to make sure that this happens.</ParaText>

The Liberals have been in power for five years. They have been missing in action on the situation in Nova Scotia for months, but this year has been a year of multiple flashpoints, in terms of Crown-indigenous relations. Five years into the current government, we have had issues across the country, in terms of people being frustrated and increasing divisions, and we have seen the government put in place policies that have blocked indigenous people's desire to develop their own natural resources in the west, in the north and in eastern Canada.</ParaText>

Top-down answers from the government have not worked. Federally imposed studies and regulations have not worked.

              <ParaText id="6290669">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to join all my colleagues here today to discuss what is a very important topic for all Canadians but indeed for my constituents in Kings—Hants. I have said it before but I will say it again. I have the privilege of representing three indigenous communities in Kings—Hants: Sipekne'katik, the community at the heart of the issue we are discussing here tonight, in Saulnierville, but also Annapolis Valley First Nation and Glooscap First Nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290670">Before I get too deep into my remarks, I want to start by giving some context to my colleagues, and indeed all Canadians, about my relationship and my history with the community of Sipekne'katik. I grew up in Lantz, which is about 10 minutes down the road. I know Chief Mike Sack personally. I coached his son in hockey. We had a lot of very successful years with the East Hants Penguins hockey association. I grew up with members from the Sipekne'katik community going to Hants East Rural High. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290671">I have seen the challenges, having been to the community a number of times, on socio-economic grounds, and I know the moderate livelihood treaty right is something that is very important to this community. That is obviously well demonstrated in our conversations here tonight, but also Chief Sack and council explained to me early in my mandate of last year that this was something they wanted to be able to move forward on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290672">I will go next to joining those who have already condemned the violence, destruction of property, intimidation and frankly the racism we have seen. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, in his remarks this evening, really wanted to highlight that his community as a whole is not represented in those actions. That is an important point to make. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290673">I had conversations with Chief Mike Sack. I had conversations with commercial fishers in my community. Many exist of course in West Nova, but I do have a commercial fishery in my riding as well. It is important to note the actions of the individuals in question do not represent the whole industry; they do not speak for the industry. It is important we focus on and denounce those who have been part of that, but also recognize that it is not necessarily indicative of the entire industry or the communities they represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290674">I want to begin by also highlighting the history of where we find ourselves and why we are here tonight. It has been well canvassed of course, but the Marshall decision of September 1999 from the Supreme Court of Canada established the moderate livelihood treaty right. It said it was communal in nature but that it was provided to Mi'kmaq and Maliseet communities. Two months later, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation> explained, the court not only reaffirmed the moderate livelihood treaty right but provided a clarification that the Government of Canada has the ability to introduce a minimally impairing regulatory framework. Of course that has not yet been done 21 years later, and I would assert that this is at least a contributing factor to some of the tensions we have seen over the past two decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290675">The aspect around minimally impairing goes back to the Badger case. The Supreme Court of Canada established in the mid-1990s that if the Government of Canada even considered impugning a constitutionally protected treaty right, it had to be minimally impairing in nature. It had to be proportional to the substantive public policy objective being achieved. The court provided conservation as one example, but left the door open for other substantive public policy objectives that the government saw as important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290676">After that decision, the governments from Chrétien and Martin really focused on ensuring Mi'kmaq communities had access to the commercial fishery. It is well established that there were hundreds of millions of dollars spent. I think at one point in 1999 the value of the commercial fishery for Mi'kmaq communities was about $3 million. It now is well over $150 million because of that initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290677">The commercial licences that were provided to Mi'kmaq communities did not impugn or infringe any of the existing treaty rights, so the moderate livelihood issue was not resolved or dealt with in those initiatives. We had the Harper government from 2006 to 2015, which had a program to provide additional capital to indigenous communities. We are partisan in the House, but I think it is objective to say that this was not a priority for that government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290678">From 2015 to now, we have had a government that has been very focused on trying to make reconciliation a pillar of its work. There is more to be done, as has been mentioned by other members in this House tonight.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="30">(2230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290679">In speaking with Chief Sack this morning, I would like to highlight the fact that, although there were Marshall initiative commercial licences provided to many Mi'kmaq communities across Atlantic Canada, Sipekne'katik had not signed on to those. Also, they were not part of any subsequent commercial funding to help support their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290680">The question is not whether or not the moderate livelihood right exists. The key reason we are here tonight is to ask and examine how we go about implementing that right. We are 21 years past the Marshall decision and, despite the work I mentioned that has advanced the interests of indigenous communities as it relates to the fishery, we have not come any closer to understanding the clarity and context needed for indigenous communities to go about exercising that right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290681">I have put public statements out to try to address this issue, given the fact that indigenous communities I represent are involved in this. The clarity we are seeking is not only important for indigenous leaders in my riding of Kings—Hants, and indeed across Atlantic Canada. It is also important for commercial fishers who are trying to understand how the moderate livelihood right is going to be exercised, what types of parameters will be set and how that co-exists with the current commercial fishing industry. That clarity is important for all those involved. When we get to that point, it is going to help reduce the tensions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290682">There has been a lot of context and conversations about having commercial fishers at the table. I would reiterate and support the position our government has taken that this is the Government of Canada dealing directly with indigenous communities, and that those negotiations have to be direct in nature. However, I would support the idea, and I think it is important, to make sure we have commercial fishers and their representatives in the industry able to have a side table or another aspect for dialogue, to make sure we can bring parties together to try to reduce the tension we are seeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290683">Simply put, last week was ugly. It was terrible to see and I know it drew the attention of Nova Scotians and Canadians, but we need to be able to find dialogue to bring down that tension. Certainly, some members in the House have discussed that tonight. That is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290684">The member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation> also talked about options or solutions. I will highlight some of the ones I have heard, by first talking about the indigenous communities I have had the chance to speak to. I spoke to Chief Mike Sack, Chief Sid Peters and Chief Gerald Toney in the three indigenous communities I represent. There is clearly a desire to want to implement this right by using the commercial plans the communities have developed in terms of self-management plans. They have made it clear to me that this is something they desire. They understand there has to be co-operation with DFO and oversight, so the word “codevelopment” has been mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290685">Other individuals have mentioned the ability to provide commercial licences to Mi'kmaq communities but to have those commercial licences with an autonomy for indigenous communities to sublicense those how they see fit to their community members, so that they would have the autonomy of how that resource is shared within the community. If it got to the point that the community could justify that there are more members who need the ability to access their moderate livelihood right, additional commercial licences could be provided. We heard from two Mi'kmaq senators and the member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation> about the aspect of creating a separate indigenous fishing authority. That is also another option that the government could look at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290686">At the end of the day, the Government of Canada does have the ability to implement a regulatory framework that is minimally impairing, and I would agree with the members who have already said we do not want to promote a top-down approach. In fact, the court in Marshall made it very clear that collaboration and negotiation is the preferred approach. However, I have been asked my position on this outside of the House and the important piece is that 21 years from now, we do not want to still be discussing this issue. We need to find a framework to move forward. If that means, worst-case scenario, that the Government of Canada was to introduce a minimally impairing regulatory framework in order to be able to implement that right, that is something I support. I want to make sure that is on the record.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290687">I am hopeful. Although this has been 21 years in the making, at the end of the day, I believe this is the watershed moment where the attention is on this issue. We have a government that is focused on wanting to implement the right and make something very positive happen. I know that will take dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290688"> I have heard a lot of comments in the House that this work needs to begin. This work has been ongoing. Sometimes it is not always visible in the public, but I know our minister has been working—</ParaText>

One of the findings that could come out of the public inquiry in Nova Scotia would be some of the challenges with respect to staffing and resource levels for the RCMP and police services in rural communities. Chief Sack spoke to me last week about his concern on the issue. I spoke to Minister Mark Furey, the attorney general of Nova Scotia, about measures that could be taken. I know he has confirmed with our federal <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and additional resources are being provided.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290711">I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this emergency debate. Many of my colleagues who had the opportunity to visit Atlantic Canada, in particular, New Brunswick Southwest, know of our traditional fishing communities. All members from my region, even those who represent ridings that do not border the ocean, understand that at the core of Atlantic Canada is a sustainable fishing industry. Quotas, licences, zones and enforcement form a complex set of rules and regulations that ensure our waters can be fished for another generation and another generation after that, long into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290712">This emergency debate is entitled “Fisheries in Nova Scotia”, but in fact it impacts all of Atlantic Canada. Therefore, what is being contested here in Parliament and down east? It is not the Supreme Court of Canada's rulings. I do not believe I have heard anyone back home dispute the legitimacy of the Marshall decisions. The violence Canadians have witnessed is to be condemned. That too is agreed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290713"> However, make no mistake, the ongoing pressure cooker we are witnessing on our east coast could have been de-escalated by Canada's <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">fisheries minister</Affiliation> and the federal government, specifically by adhering to the Marshall decisions and bringing affected fishing families to the table. This did not happen. Instead, fishing is happening out of season.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290714">Fishing seasons are normally rigorously enforced by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. However, not now, just as the regulated season is set to begin. People are confused and worried.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290715"> I do not condone the destruction of property and indigenous communities have the constitutional rights that have been spelled out by the courts. Moreover, they have the right to live safely like every other Canadian in the country, which is why we can understand both how indigenous peoples are anxious to exercise rights and how non-indigenous fisheries throughout Atlantic Canada are asking how decisions, made in a faraway capital, could impact them, their communities and their way of life. They have not received a reply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290716">Economist and social theorist, Thomas Sowell, once said, “The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.” As we know, the first lesson of politics is too often to disregard the first lesson of economics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290717"> Too many fishing communities worry the federal government is biased against them and their way of life and will make them pay the bill for Canada's neglect of indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290718">Canada's <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">opposition leader</Affiliation> raised the deteriorating situation with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on September 18 and urged the federal government to de-escalate tensions and find a solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290719"> Maritime MPs could hear and see what was happening. This was true in Nova Scotia, this was true in P.E.I. and it was true in New Brunswick. Many of us raised these concerns in our caucuses and in the House, but time and time again the federal <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">fisheries minister</Affiliation> failed to respond. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290720">Today, after violence, confusion and uncertainty, we have this emergency debate. This is a record of failure, not leadership. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290721">What must we do moving forward? My Liberal colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252509" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> touched on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290722"> A necessary first step is for all members to understand the two Marshall decisions, those rights as well as responsibilities. The Supreme Court of Canada was clear that treaty rights were subject to federal regulations. The court stressed the priority of conservation and the responsibility to administer them belonged to the minister, not on indigenous or non-indigenous fishing communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290723">Nova Scotia Liberal premier Stephen McNeil is also calling on the federal government to do its job. He said, “The quickest way and the best way to reduce tension is to have the federal minister and the department at the table with both sides at the same time.” He is correct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290724"> First nations are entitled to be consulted about management on the exercise of their treaty rights, as laid out in Marshall. Similarly, Canada's <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">fisheries minister</Affiliation> should be discussing her vision with Canadians, including our fishing communities. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="45">(2245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6290725">The fisheries minister said that she is in discussion with fishing associations. I do not believe that this is true, unless she thinks that one-way communication is dialogue, but that is not real dialogue, and it is not fair play. The minister has hired a retired DFO employee as a negotiator with 34 indigenous bands, yet no similar outreach has been made with commercial fishers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290726">Importantly, Canada's fisheries minister must stop relinquishing her duty of enforcement. DFO officers are highly trained and capable peace officers. The RCMP is no replacement. In fact, I believe once disputes are off the water and on the land, we have already missed the boat on solving the problem peacefully. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290727">Atlantic Canada needs unbiased federal leadership. The government must offer that leadership while still recognizing the obligation that Canada has toward the two groups. These groups are different. Their expectations are different, but they both need to be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290728">Finally, I want to close my remarks by identifying a clear point to the government: Indigenous communities are already a part of Canada's traditionally regulated fishing communities. It started small. It is growing, but it is happening. They hold licences. They adhere to DFO guidelines, and they follow the rules. When the government works in silos to change the rules of the game, it is working to undermine the progress that has already been made.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290749">A month ago, the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> raised this situation directly with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He told us about that again tonight. He asked the Prime Minister to step in and de-escalate tensions, and find a solution. Chief Sack, who himself has been assaulted during these demonstrations, released a statement that the arson “illustrates the need for greater police presence in the region....I do believe with the proper police presence, however, this could have been avoided”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290750">During Oral Questions earlier today, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>, the shadow minister for public safety, asked the minister why it took him so long to act and to ensure the safety of the Mi'kmaq people. Why did it take a very serious act of arson for the government to act? This sort of after-the-fact crisis management seems to be the only way the government deals with issues. Why is it that almost all affected groups can agree that the path forward is open and honest dialogue, yet it is the path that the government seems unwilling to take? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290751">I agree that this situation is in fact an emergency, but the fact that the ministers in the government have requested an emergency debate perfectly sums up the government's preference for symbolic measures rather than actions. In my meetings and discussions with indigenous people I deal with, what I am hearing is that they are tired of the government's talk. They need action. Instead of debating this in Ottawa today, participating in press conferences and repeating talking points here in the House, these ministers should be on the ground in Nova Scotia, talking to the people there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290752">Many people have compared this situation to others earlier in the year, however, the similarities begin and end with the lack of proactive leadership. These issues have been allowed to simmer over a long period of time, with groups from all sides calling for action and leadership from the government. Instead of early actions, what consistently happens is that these simmering issues become full-blown fires that result in political talking points, finger-pointing and crisis management, rather than respectful dialogue and peaceful negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290753">What do we see in Nova Scotia at the moment? I know I am a long ways away, but here is what I am seeing. The <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation>, who lives in the same province that this emergency is taking place, is now holding press conferences and calling for late-night debates in an attempt to distract from the fact that she and her government have mishandled this issue for months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290754">Canadians are tired of this, and they are not buying it anymore. This is not a new issue. The Liberals have now sat on the government benches for five years. As a result of their failures, we now have seen people injured, property damaged and livelihoods challenged. Tensions between indigenous and non-indigenous fishermen are at an all-time high in this region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290755">I would never pretend to speak for first nations people, however, my experience growing up in northern Saskatchewan showed me that relationship-building is important and valued. It is something that I think all Canadians could learn from. That is why it is counterproductive for the Liberal ministers to be here in Ottawa debating this issue, rather than meeting with people on the ground, and developing real and authentic relationships, working towards actual solutions. The last thing this issue needs is more political debate. It needs actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290756">In both Marshall decisions in 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly affirmed the right of the Mi'kmaq to hunt, fish and gather in pursuit of a moderate livelihood arising out of the peace and friendship treaties of 1760 and 1761 with Britain. However, there were restrictions outlined by the court, and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans was to regulate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290757">First, this is where the term “moderate livelihood” is first introduced. In the Marshall decision, the Supreme Court of Canada wrote:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Catch limits that could reasonably be expected to produce a moderate livelihood for individual Mi’kmaq families at present-day standards can be established by regulation and enforced without violating the treaty right.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290759">The Premier of Nova Scotia has now joined the call of many others for the government to seek a definition of present-day standards of “moderate livelihood”, and to give guidance to all of the parties. Premier McNeil stated, “This is only getting more entrenched...they need to be in the same room so everyone knows what each other is saying”. Instead of seeking this clarity, the government has decided to hold press conferences and late-night debates. Again, there is talk but little action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290760">Second, the Supreme Court of Canada outlined that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has the responsibility of ensuring proper conservation. I quote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290761">

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The regulatory device of a closed season is at least in part directed at conservation of the resource.

As acknowledged by the Native Council of Nova Scotia in opposition to the Coalition’s motion, “[c]onservation is clearly a first priority and the Aboriginal peoples accept this”. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290762">The <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation> could have requested that her department undertake a study to determine whether the out-of-season fishing endangers lobster stocks and could have made those results public, but instead she and her colleagues chose to hold press conferences and late-night debates. Again, there is talk but little action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290763">Let me be clear. As I said when I began my comments tonight, while the government has, without question, failed to handle this crisis, violence, vandalism, assault, threats and intimidation tactics are always wrong and they are never justified. The safety of all Canadians must be the government's top priority. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government must take the concrete steps necessary to keep everybody in Nova Scotia safe in their communities and to resolve this situation in a peaceful manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290764"> Pitting groups against each other has only led to the current situation. This issue is not about indigenous versus non-indigenous. All Nova Scotians are being let down by a federal government that has failed to take action and has ignored the issue for five years, and now refuses to meet with all of the parties to come to a peaceful resolution. Make no mistake, the Liberal minister's request for an emergency debate is, as Toronto journalist Chris Selley put it, “jaw-droppingly cynical”. It is purely political and, as they have with all of their failures, all criticism by opposition parties will be labelled as petty partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290765">In closing, I would hope that members on all sides of the House can agree that it is time the current Liberal government started showing leadership on this issue. It is time that the Liberals move on from the platitudes and empty promises and do the work that Canadians elected them to do.</ParaText>

The only way to do that is through de-escalation and continued dialogue, and we are hearing a lot of that tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290795">Recent events surrounding Nova Scotia's fisheries have brought this issue to the forefront. However, let me be clear that our government's priority remains and will always remain the safety of everyone involved. We need and want to lower all the tensions for a calm, productive resolution to this impasse. There is room for everyone's voices to be heard and we can build a safe, productive and sustainable lobster fishery for all harvesters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290796"> I, like all Canadians, especially those in my province of Nova Scotia, am saddened by the events in Digby county and West Pubnico. This government condemns the actions of every single individual who destroyed property, committed violence or uttered threats. There is no place for this kind of violence or intimidation in Canada, and I know Canadians across the country share the same feeling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290797">It is especially disturbing to hear reports of racist comments by some and actions made toward first nations people. This is unacceptable. We all have a responsibility, and I believe somebody else said it tonight, to call this kind of behaviour out, and the language. I would be remiss to say that the actions of some of the fishers in West Nova is not reflective of the community I have come to know. They are good people, caring people, industrious people, but the actions by those individuals need to be taken into account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290800">Canada has started on the path to right these wrongs in partnership with indigenous people, provincial governments, territorial governments and all Canadians. We are currently working in collaboration with first nations to implement their treaty rights to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. Since the landmark Supreme Court of Canada Marshall decision of 1999, which affirmed these rights, the path toward implementation has had its successes and its setbacks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290801">Over the years, the department has launched several programs and has made investments to address the rights of the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet communities in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, beginning with the Marshall response initiative. Then we have subsequent programs like the Atlantic integrated commercial fisheries initiative that continues today to provide funding and support to Marshall communities to build the capacity of the commercial fishing enterprises and strengthen community economic self-sufficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290802">We have been negotiating with Marshall groups since 2017 to collaborate on the articulation of their rights to the rights of reconciliation agreements. Last year we signed rights and reconciliation agreements with three first nations communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290807">Yes, I have been in contact with commercial fishers in my riding and they have been clear.

I would like to note that the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is committed to appointing a ministerial special representative to help foster dialogue and co-operation and this appointment will be informed by consultations with both first nations and industry representatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290808">I also know that in my travels throughout my riding, many voiced concerns over conservation. I want them and everyone to know that we are listening. Conservation is a priority shared by everyone: DFO, first nations and industry. Every party wants to see this resource conserved for generations to come and I believe we have that in common. I want to assure everyone that DFO will continue to monitor stocks and will only move forward with a plan that ensures the health of the fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290809">I think we can all agree that reconciliation is an imperative for Canada. That is why it is important to work in the spirit of respect. We all have a role to play. What is currently happening in Nova Scotia does not advance this goal, nor does it support the implementation of first nations treaty rights or a productive or orderly fishery. Frankly, it is not helping any party involved. More importantly, I know that this is not a true reflection of Nova Scotia, my home province and my home.

              <ParaText id="6290828">I have received an incredible volume of correspondence and outreach from my constituents in Dartmouth—Cole Harbour on this issue, passionate, thoughtful emails, and so many that I will not be able to respond to everyone individually. Nova Scotians want to know that the Mi'kmaq will be protected from racism and violence, and that their treaty rights will be respected and implemented. I have been just as concerned throughout this unrest. From my many conversations with ministers in our government, I know that they share this concern. I know those are not empty words because they are acting on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290829">The Mi'kmaq fishermen and the first nations communities have been let down by those whose job it is to protect them. I can tell colleagues that my constituents do not want to hear what jurisdiction is in charge of what. They want to know that all orders of government are working together to keep all people safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290830">I am grateful that our government approved a request for assistance from the Province of Nova Scotia to enhance the presence of RCMP officers as needed. These disgusting acts of violence must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators must be held to account. I am glad to see that the RCMP have laid charges, including for the assault against Chief Sack, but I want to make it very clear that more needs to be done. Tensions need to be lowered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290831">In Nova Scotia we are all treaty people. The peace and friendship treaties of 1760 and 1761 are solemn, special agreements and lasting commitments. They affirm a treaty right to hunt, to fish and to gather in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. The Supreme Court of Canada's September 17, 1999, decision in the Donald Marshall case affirmed this treaty right, and we affirm this treaty right. The decision affected 34 Mi'kmaq and Maliseet first nations in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and the Gaspé region of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290832">From listening to my Mi'kmaq parliamentary colleagues on this issue, such as my friend, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation>, I have learned that this would be the first treaty ruling that would allow indigenous people not just to survive but to thrive financially in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290833">Through the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries</Affiliation> I have learned that, following the Marshall decision, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans launched a series of initiatives and programs to help implement this treaty right. We now know that although some of these initiatives and programs were successful, others were not. Some programs included the Marshall response initiative, which provided first nation communities with licences, vessels and gear in order to increase the diversity of their participation in the commercial fisheries and contribute to the pursuit of a moderate livelihood for first nations members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290834">This was followed by the Atlantic integrated commercial fisheries initiative in 2007, which provided funding and support to Marshall communities to build the capacity of their communal commercial fishing enterprises and to strengthen their communities' economic self-sufficiency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290859">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank everyone who participated in this debate tonight. Before I begin, let me state what I do not know. I do not know the Marshall decisions, I have never read them. I do not know the member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation>, the only Mi'kmaq member of the House of Commons. I do not think I have been in the traditional territory of the Mi'kmaq people. I am acknowledging tonight where I am at as an individual and not trying to say things that are beyond my comprehension of this very delicate indigenous-Crown issue that we are seeing happen in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290860">Second, before I begin, I am very confused because standing here tonight I was reading The Globe and Mail and I saw an article from the Liberal House leader quoted about tomorrow, about facing a confidence vote over the WE Charity. I am confused. Why would the government call an emergency debate if it is calling the bluff on Parliament about whether or not we are going to have a federal election? Do the Liberals care about reconciliation and do they care about all of the thoughtful words that were said tonight, or are they going to throw us into a federal election, shove this issue under the carpet and let it all go away while they seek a majority government? I would like some answers from the Liberal government on that point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290861">Now, getting to why we are here tonight in the first place. Unfortunately, it is a direct result of the actions and inactions of the federal government. One of the most important aspects of being a government, of leadership, is accountability, peace and order. What we have seen here tonight is a sad expression of leadership as aptly stated by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252627" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation> in his remarks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290862">In my short time here as an MP, the Liberals have shut down debate, they have filibustered, they tried to hide documents and, if all that failed, we heard a lot tonight that it is Stephen Harper's fault. The government has been in power for five years, in fact, tonight it is celebrating five years of the government. Instead of actually taking action on this crisis, the Liberals have decided to hold an emergency debate 1,000 kilometres away from where it is actually happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290863">The Liberal minister who requested this debate already had the power to resolve this. The Liberals can protect the Mi'kmaq people and they can protect the sustainability of the fisheries at the same time. That is their job. I am going to ask the Library of Parliament tomorrow whether we have ever had an emergency debate called by four ministers who also acknowledged that they were part of the problem, that the Government of Canada was part of the problem. This might be a new precedent in parliamentary history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290864">On this side of the House we have been asking the government to de-escalate the Nova Scotia fisheries crisis for over a month. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> implored the minister this evening that he would get in his truck, pick her up and bring her in good faith to negotiate to find a solution. The<Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4"> indigenous services minister</Affiliation> said police are being overwhelmed, but still no action, just tweets. The<Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4"> public safety minister</Affiliation> said it was the province's problem.

              <ParaText id="6290865">Chief Mike Sack said to the government, “Do your job. Protect [us].... Don't just tweet about it.” Colin Sproul of the Fundy Inshore Fishermen's Association said the Liberal government is “hiding under a desk”. Here we are, more tweets, more inaction and the Liberals trying to make it look like they are doing something by holding this emergency debate where neither side of the dispute is actually happening and neither where the real work needs to happen as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290866">Last week, more than 200 people overwhelmed police. Vehicles and boats were lit on fire as early as the week before. This situation did not just suddenly spiral out of control. It has been going on for a while.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290867">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation> mentioned in the House earlier today, livelihoods and decades of relationship building literally went up in flames. The <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> hid behind prepared statements, and the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries</Affiliation> was nowhere to be seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290868">It seems like the government waits for the situation to get out of control before acknowledging the problem. That is what it did with the rail blockades earlier in the year, and what it did when it came to calling a public inquiry into the Nova Scotia mass shooting. That is what it is doing here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290869">The government should have anticipated this. Across Canada, rural crime has been a growing issue. It is something we have been talking about for a long time in this House. There is a significant lack of police resources in remote and rural communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290870">In Lillooet, a community I represent, there are Facebook groups talking about vigilante groups. The mayor implored me to get the provincial minister of public safety to do something, because they only have three RCMP officers for a region the size of a small European country. They just did not know what to do, and they did not know how to respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290871">Thankfully, to the credit to the St'át'imc people and first nations police forces in my riding, they were able to pick up some of the slack. Thank god they are there. Hopefully Lillooet, tribal council and their police force can serve as good example of what could take place in Nova Scotia, because some of the indigenous police forces are doing really great work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290872">Front-line officers do their best in the RCMP, but they are stretched thin. By not ensuring there are adequate RCMP resources in rural Nova Scotia and across Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> is putting these communities, and the people who live within them, at risk. He is putting front-line officers at risk. We have seen these risks escalating, including acts of violence and arson. The indigenous people are also at risk because we do not have enough RCMP officers. It goes both ways, and it is just a bad situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290873">I cannot help but draw some similarities to my own riding. I represent Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon. It is 22,000 square kilometres of rugged British Columbia. The Fraser River runs through my riding from the south end all the way to the north. One thing we have in common with Nova Scotia is that many of the indigenous people I represent, and many of the non-indigenous people I represent, are totally dependent upon a fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290874">If one talks to the recreational fishermen, the tour guides and some of the commercial people, they will say they acknowledge the Marshall decision. They may not be happy with it all the time, but they acknowledge it and want to work with it. They say they have frustrations too with some of the indigenous people over some of their fishing techniques, including gillnets, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290875">Then, in talking to the indigenous people, I learn they have frustrations with the commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for not respecting enough of their rights. They wonder why they are not getting a fair deal, and in many cases, they are correct. They are not getting a fair deal. That needs to be worked out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290876">If we talk to both sides, the one thing they have in common, and often they do not even understand this, is that both point to the lack of competency of the department of fisheries and oceans to take meaningful action to resolve these deep-seated disputes between indigenous and non-indigenous fishers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290877">What is happening in Nova Scotia is a broader reflection of what is happening across Canada. We are seeing civil strife. There is a real and clear lack of trust in our institutions. There is growing frustration that, as a member of Parliament, I do not have an answer to. Like I said in the beginning, I have never read the Marshall decisions, and I acknowledge that. However, there is growing animosity.</ParaText>

At the heart of this, we need to see a commitment from the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> to get on the ground as soon as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6290886">Earlier in tonight's debate, we heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talk about consecutive governments failing and succeeding. Then we heard the Leader of the Opposition say the same thing. Despite some of the tension between our two sides tonight, there was some agreement that we have collectively, at certain points, not lived up to what we were supposed to, irrespective of who was in power. That is a lesson for all of us. We need to get to the points that matter and really do something that is going to address these livelihood issues for indigenous peoples and other fishermen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290887">As I said in the beginning, I do not have all the answers and I am not an expert on what is going on in Nova Scotia. However, I am afraid that Nova Scotia is a broader reflection of tensions between communities all across Canada. I implore the government to get this right, to work with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> on the ground to negotiate and do what is best for indigenous people.</ParaText>

I asked the Sts'ailes first nation to take me onto its land near the Harrison River to see where their people have fished since they began recording time. They have always fished there. One of the members of the band told me about an experience when he was shot with a BB gun by a non-indigenous fisher over their rights. Again, it speaks to this broader discontent and growing animosity in our society that needs to be addressed by DFO. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290913">The first nations are the first ones to point out that DFO has some guy in Ottawa telling them where they should be doing their conservation work, that there is some DFO official in Ottawa telling them how many fish go up the run, but the officials do not understand the fish like they do and the officials need to get out of the way and let the first nations do some of the important work. When I talk to the recreational fishermen and the people who work in tourism, they say the same thing: DFO does not know what it is talking about, it does not know where the fish go and what are those scientists in Ottawa actually saying?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6290914">There was the Fraser Salmon Collaborative Management Agreement last year that was signed by some of the Sto:lo nations and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
