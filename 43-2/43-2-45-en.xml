              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-260. Introduction and first reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="6419686"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am certainly pleased to rise today to table my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="10929012" Type="4">C-260</Document>, entitled an act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act. The title of the bill may sound simple, and that is intentional. That is because it is simple. The bill intends to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act to allow Canadians to order and enjoy their favourite wine, spirit or craft beer from any province or territory from sea to sea to sea, without restriction, delivered to their doorstep by the fine employees of Canada Post.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419687">As it currently stands, many Canadians cannot find their preferred wine, spirit or craft beer on the shelf of their local stores, and Canadian producers are unable to ship their product because of these archaic and outdated interprovincial restrictions that continue to vex this country. This not only stands in the way of the enjoyment of these products by all Canadians, but also hurts these small and medium-sized businesses by limiting who they can sell and ship to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419688">The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that Canadians feel more comfortable and safe shopping online or over the phone. This simple amendment would not only increase the happiness of Canadians and allow them to shop safely, but also help the small businesses that are seeing a sharp decrease in their local foot traffic because of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419689">I am confident that all members in this place will join me in supporting this bill to enact a simple amendment and open the taps to all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419701">Mr. Speaker, it my pleasure to rise on behalf of the Conservative Party on probably the most important bill before this Parliament. I say that, without knowing how long this Parliament will run, because this is a decision with respect to the state interacting with one of its citizens at end of life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419702">This is probably one of the most important debates this Parliament will have, and if there is commentary coming from the government or from some pundits on why we are late and why we are approaching a time limit, that was entirely in the hands of the government for three reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419703">First, the government decided, with no reason and no grounds, to prorogue Parliament. We lost several months that could have been spent having substantive and compassionate debate on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and a range of other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419704">Second, the bill results from a Superior Court judgment in Quebec, and normally something so fundamental would have been appealed to two higher courts: the Court of Appeal in Quebec and the Supreme Court of Canada. That was not done, and it should have been. Most legal observers believe this should have been the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419705">Finally, as we may hear from the government and the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> today, they could have asked for more time, given the prorogation, their own delays and the pandemic. I think they will end up doing that today, and that is appropriate.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6419706">We are getting close to the deadline for this bill because of the government's inaction. The government was slow to appeal a Quebec court decision. The government also prorogued Parliament. That is why we are so close to a deadline set by a Quebec court decision. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6419707">As I said when I spoke to the previous bill, now Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, four and a half to five years ago, when we debate the role of the state at the end of life of one of its citizens, there is compassion on both sides. There are people who do not want to see the suffering of someone near the end of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419708">I will speak to the Sue Rodriguez case, when the Supreme Court was first charged with this. Someone with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, loses their physical abilities and is confined in a horrible way. Approaching end of life, are they able to consent in the same way that someone would otherwise and make their own decisions about end of life?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419709">There is compassion from people who want the well-being of their loved ones to be provided for. There is also compassion from people who are concerned about the state making determinations about quality of life. In fact, the justice in Quebec quoted many speeches from the last Parliament on the previous bill, following the Carter decision, including my speech. I talked about the concerns of a slippery slope and that we would be back in a few years. I said more vulnerable people might be swept into a law, and I am sad to say that is exactly where we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419710">As a parliamentarian, a lawyer, a father and the son of a brave woman who fought cancer, with profound memories of her from the palliative stage of that disease when I was nine, I am here to make sure the bill is debated properly and that safeguards are provided. Anyone who suggests we should be rushing this debate does not understand how profound it is. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6419711">Today's debate should be approached with respect and compassion. It is not a normal debate on normal policies. We are talking about the power of the government to take away a person's life at that person's request. It is a very serious action, and the debate that seeks to establish an appropriate legal framework is a necessary one. We are talking here about the value of human life, about human dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419712">I know that people on both sides of this debate have good intentions, but I am concerned that the bill is a first dent in the value we place on life. It is a slippery slope that we should not be taking with such a vague law and no safeguards. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6419713">In the Rodriguez decision, Justice Sopinka, who represented the Supreme Court at the time in the 1990s, talked about the distinction of a passive role of the state and an active role of the state at the end of life. “Passive” refers to palliative care, assistance with pain and, potentially, non-intervention, do not resuscitate, but the active role, when the state takes that role, attaches to section 7 of the charter, which is based on human dignity. The <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Attorney General</Affiliation> clerked under Peter Cory of the same court, and in fact, the McLachlin and Cory dissents both focused on human dignity with respect to section 7 of the charter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419714">All of them talked about the role of the state in protecting the decisionally vulnerable, as they were called, people who could be pushed into end-of-life treatment because they felt they were a burden. This has been talked about since the 1990s, and this <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Attorney General</Affiliation> is removing the safeguards from our regime. Every ounce of case law on the issue of assisted dying, euthanasia or assisted suicide talks about protecting those vulnerable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419715">That went on in the Carter decision, which reinterpreted and changed the stare decisis, the precedent of the Rodriguez decision, because of societal norms, but the one thing that did not change was the need for safeguards. In fact, the Carter court said that a “carefully designed...system of safeguards” was required and that they would be scrupulously monitored. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419716">That is the only way the Carter decision changed the Rodriguez decision and allowed there to be assisted dying in Canada. However, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> does not provide for assisted dying. It provides for assisted suicide, where the end of life, the reasonably foreseeable death, is removed entirely, and it removes the safeguards that every decision of the court on this subject has said are fundamental to the state having a role at end of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419717">The <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Attorney General</Affiliation> seems to be out of touch with the entire body of case law with respect to assisted death. I think it is shameful that he is not allowing reasonable amendments to reinsert a scrupulous approach to the vulnerable. He is removing the 10-day waiting period. There is no coming back from this decision, and when the state plays an active role in the death of its citizens, the two-witness requirement is also removed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419718">The <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Attorney General</Affiliation>, who is entirely out of touch with the case law in Canada, out of touch with the decision of Mr. Cory whom he clerked for, is rushing something, suggesting we are being unreasonable, when all Conservatives want to do is safeguard the decisionally vulnerable, something both Supreme Court decisions in Rodriguez and Carter said was critical to human dignity, section 7 of the charter. All disability groups are opposed to this bill the way the government is presenting it because of the removal of safeguards and because of the redefinition.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419723">The government is a little upset the Conservative caucus is demanding what two decisions of the Supreme Court have demanded and is asking for, reasonably, what section 7 of the charter is built upon, which is dignity of life, to make sure we do not change the regime in a manner I spoke about five years ago: a slippery slope for the decisionally vulnerable such as the elderly isolated in a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419724">We heard testimony of some people feeling like they were pushed or pressured because of the cost or lack of institutional care. Some of the professors and some of the indigenous witnesses who have raised concerns also raise concerns about generational trauma, residential schools and people who are facing that trauma and pain in their lives. Is the state then going to provide assisted suicide as a tool or should we help these people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419725">This is about compassion. This is about an appropriate role for the state. This is not about fundamentally changing a regime that has only been in place for a few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419726">I said at the outset there is compassion on both sides, but there is an entirely out-of-step approach from the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation>. In fact, the former attorney general, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253061" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, has also criticized the reckless approach of this Attorney General with respect to the post-Carter decision regime, because he would be removing the safeguards both courts have said need to be scrupulously monitored: 10 days, a few witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419727">All major disability groups in Canada agree with the compassionate and reasonable position being presented by my Conservative colleagues. I am very proud of the advocacy we have shown. We have also been joined by legal scholars, indigenous leaders and people working with people with mental health issues. I have worked on mental health and suicide prevention for many years since my time in the military. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419728">We are also not providing enough palliative care support. Going back to the original Rodriguez framework, where Justice Sopinka talked about the passive role of the state, allowing someone's life to end without pain and to be present, allowing family gathering at palliative, we are not doing that well enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419729">The government has actually violated the spirit of the Carter decision by removing the safeguards. Remember, the safeguards, the carefully designed safeguards, were fundamental to the Supreme Court Carter decision change from Rodriguez. Why after a few years would the government remove those, particularly when some of the vulnerable Canadians, seniors and disability rights advocates, have said they feel under attack? In fact, another comment Ms. Carr made is that Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is their “worst nightmare”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419730">What is the job of Parliament? We are not just delegates here to be polled. We are here to bring our perspective in the Burkean tradition of being passionate representatives for our communities, our families, our values and our points of view. I cannot think of a more important debate for us to bring those values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419731">As the Supreme Court said back in Rodriguez and throughout, this is about human dignity with respect to access to section 7. The early debate, both in Carter and Rodriguez, was always that we cannot have an unfairness for someone who cannot physically make a decision about end-of-life suicide, so we have to have an approach. That was McLachlin's approach in the dissent in Rodriguez. She thought that choice was cruel with respect to Sue Rodriguez.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419732">It was never about just having a widespread approach to assisted suicide with no irremediable or reasonably foreseeable death being a part of it. Now this is opening up a state-run regime with respect to suicide, with vague terms about grievous conditions or just disability writ large. The same concerns I raised reasonably a few years ago around people with mental health issues, who could get help if we are there for them, or people who are decisionally vulnerable, as the court said for now a generation, are why the safeguards are there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419733">The government should not lecture us about timelines when it prorogued Parliament and when it did not appeal a superior court decision on a fundamental issue just a few years after the Supreme Court ruled in Carter. It is now ignoring disability advocates. It is ignoring indigenous leaders. It is ignoring physicians, legal scholars and the opposition. What are we demanding? We are not saying eliminate the system that was established in the last Parliament. We are saying to maintain the safeguards. There would be no Supreme Court right under section 7 of the charter were it not for the safeguards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419734">I am proud that the Conservative opposition is not going to step away and allow our vulnerable to be forgotten. We are going to scrupulously maintain the safeguards that the state should have when we are making profound decisions about the end of life of our citizens. We are here for the people without a voice. We are here for the people who might feel coerced, in isolation during a pandemic, into an end-of-life regime without full capacity and consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419735">If we step outside the bubble, I do not care what political party one belongs to or associates with, all Canadians want to make sure the vulnerable are provided for. That is all we are asking. If we have to stay here for 24 hours a day, seven days a week to stand up for those Canadians, we will do that.</ParaText>

Is it the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation>, who does not understand the entire body of jurisprudence with respect to assisted death? I am actually very disappointed. He was a law professor at McGill and seems to have not read the Rodriguez and Carter decisions. He is removing safeguards that are fundamental to protecting the decisionally vulnerable as per Sopinka, McLachlin and Cory in Rodriguez, and the McLachlin court in Carter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419737">Every single indication from the Supreme Court of Canada says that we cannot have end-of-life assisted dying, assisted suicide, euthanasia or whatever words someone uses, that section 7 charter right cannot be accessed without a very carefully crafted and scrupulously governed system of safeguards. This includes a 10-day review period to make sure somebody was not at their lowest point and then the state moves in, and two witnesses to make sure that there is not someone vulnerable being forced or coerced into it. These are very reasonable amendments that not just Conservative MPs are asking for, but Canadians are asking for.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419741">When we come to the bar and bow to you, Madam Speaker, that is because Parliament is a court.

When the government suggests we are being unreasonable because we want to keep with the spirit of the Carter decision, this court should be respected that as well.

              <ParaText id="6419742">If the government just reviewed the Carter and Rodriguez decisions and provided those safeguards, held up the dignity required under section 7 of the charter, we could ensure that the right guaranteed in Carter would be respected with a rigorous and scrupulous approach to protecting the decisionally vulnerable and most vulnerable in our society. The Conservatives are here to provide those reasonable amendments for the well-being of our country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6419768">Madam Speaker, I am very grateful for the opportunity to put a few words on the record concerning Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code, medical assistance in dying, which I will refer to as MAID throughout my remarks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419769">The bill from the Liberal government would amend the original MAID legislation that achieved royal assent only four and a half years ago. The new bill was initiated in response to the Truchon case, where a federal court in Quebec struck down the clause in the original legislation that said MAID could only be applied if natural death was reasonably foreseeable. The Quebec Superior Court judge ruled on September 11, 2019, just over a year ago, that this clause violated section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the right to life, liberty and security of the person, making this clause of the original legislation unconstitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419770">The court's ruling will come into effect on December 18 of this year. The Conservatives have held firm to the position that this ruling by the Quebec Superior Court should have been appealed by the federal government to the Supreme Court of Canada. Given that it is a ruling that affects life and death, I sincerely agree with our position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419771">Had the Liberal government appealed, it would have given Canadians significantly more time to discuss this very critical issue, and had the Liberal government not prorogued Parliament for six weeks in August and September, Parliament would have had more time to study and debate the bill. However, this position was resoundingly ignored by the Liberal government. Now we are voting on a radical expansion of MAID, and I have many concerns and will not be supporting the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419772">I do understand the desire for legalizing MAID in Canada. I witnessed my grandmother suffer terribly at the end of her life. MAID was not made available to her and, frankly, I do not know if she would have chosen it. She was a very strong and resilient woman, with a gift of the gab and an incredible ability to write, which I have inherited those gifts. That is why I am able to be here today as a member of Parliament, which she would have been so proud to see. She had these abilities despite not even having a grade eight education. She would have achieved amazing things had she not been born into a very poor family in rural Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419773">She tragically suffered a stroke and after that she could not speak or write, her favourite things. Then her diabetes wreaked havoc on her body and her leg had to be amputated as a result. A short while later, the doctors told us that they would have to amputate her other leg. It was really horrible and the worst thing in my life to see her go through this. I wonder if MAID would have been a kinder option for her. For that reason I understand and deeply appreciate why MAID was legalized in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419774">However, the Conservatives have flagged a number of critical issues with this new expansion of MAID and we worked hard to bring forward amendments to ensure safeguards remained in place for Canada's most vulnerable people. Unfortunately, the Liberals voted against every one of our proposed amendments, and I really do not understand why. We presented many strong, sound arguments from stakeholders across the country, most of whom had no partisan connection whatsoever to the Conservative Party. In fact, this is not a partisan issue and yet it is being treated like one by the Liberal government, which I find deeply upsetting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419775">When I was researching the bill to determine my position, I was startled to discover that over 1,000 physicians had written to the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> in opposition to the bill. I would like to read into the record some of what their letter said because I found it extremely compelling. They said: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419785">More than that, the Liberals are even ignoring the United Nations with this legislation. A UN special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities responded to the expansion of MAID with clear dismay. She said:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I am extremely concerned about the implementation of the legislation on medical assistance in dying from a disability perspective. I have been informed that there is no protocol in place to demonstrate that persons with disabilities have been provided with viable alternatives when eligible for assistive dying. I have further received worrisome claims about persons with disabilities in institutions being pressured to seek medical assistance in dying, and practitioners not formally reporting cases involving persons with disabilities. I urge the federal government to investigate these complaints and put into place adequate safeguards to ensure that persons with disabilities do not request assistive dying simply because of the absence of community-based alternatives and palliative care.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419787">That is a pretty powerful quote, in my opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419788">We know that there are considerable issues with palliative care. We know that 70% of Canadians, seven out of 10, do not have access to palliative end-of-life care in Canada. I find that to be a shocking number, and I had no idea until I did research for this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419789">I do believe that without access to good quality palliative care, we have failed to offer Canadians a real choice. If they cannot peacefully live out their final moments with safe, reliable care that is supportive and catered to their needs, then I can understand why MAID would be so appealing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419790"> More than that, the COVID-19 pandemic has really lifted the veil on the terrible state of elderly care in Canada. In Winnipeg, our residents in elderly care homes have suffered tremendously. While we have many care homes that are doing phenomenal, outstanding work, others, not so much. A few weeks ago, Manitobans were horrified at revelations of an elderly care home just outside of my riding that was understaffed, and overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419791">When paramedics arrived, they found that some residents had been dead for hours and no one knew. Others were severely dehydrated and starving to death. If we are to provide dignity in dying, we must also ensure dignity in living. This is paramount to the discussion and has been completely ignored by the Liberal government. In fact, in the Liberals' 2015 election platform, they promised billions of dollars for palliative care. This was never delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419792"> Further to that, I found it alarming that the 10-day reflection period in the original MAID legislation would be eliminated with the passage of this bill. It is important to note that the existing MAID legislation allows the 10-day reflection period to be waived under special circumstances, so flexibility on this 10-day reflection period is already in the existing MAID framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419793"> I am really not married to the 10 days specifically. It could be a bit shorter, or it could be a bit longer. I would need to hear from professionals in psychology to truly understand how many days are best to ensure end-of-life decisions are not made emotionally, or made in the heat of the moment, so to speak. However, I do firmly believe, at the very least, someone who requests MAID should have to sleep on it, given that there is no going back from it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419794">Given there are tough days, whether someone had a poor interaction with a health care worker or does not like their new room or facility, or their family has not visited in a while, or it has just been a physically or emotionally tough and painful day, there are so many reasons why someone within their most vulnerable state should have safeguards in place when making life-ending, “game over” decisions. With this legislation, if it is passed, MAID could be administered only hours later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419795">What really solidified my thoughts on the removal of this safeguard was the former Liberal minister of justice, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253061" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, who was responsible for the original MAID legislation only four and a half years ago. She questioned the current <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> on removing the reflection period, given removing this safeguard was not called for in the Truchon decision. The person who brought forward this legislation four and a half years ago is asking why the Liberals are removing this reflection period, yet we received no firm answer from the Liberal government as to why that is. I find that to be pretty compelling. The Liberals, for reasons unknown, went far beyond what was required in the Truchon case when they created Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, and I believe these concerns are valid.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6419796"> In fact, we learned in the “First Annual Report on Medical Assistance in Dying in Canada, 2019”, that 3.6% of patients who made written requests for MAID subsequently withdrew those requests. Now, 3.6% may not sound like a lot, but of the 7,336 people who applied for MAID, 263 of them changed their minds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419797">We should keep in mind that MAID is new in Canada and not easily accessible everywhere. Members can imagine how many people will be applying for this after Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> passes. As MAID becomes increasingly normalized, we know that 263 lives were allowed to continue to live on because of that reflection period, which is, in my opinion, so important to maintain. However, it will not exist moving forward because of the Liberal government's refusal to listen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419798">Conservatives also proposed an amendment that would extend the new 90-day reflection period for those seeking MAID whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable. We proposed to extend it to 120 days, and the arguments for this are solid. The over 1,000 doctors who I quoted earlier have said, “We live in a country where the wait time to see a psychiatrist in certain areas is 4-8 times longer than the 90-day waiting period proposed in the bill for those whose natural death is not considered 'reasonably foreseeable'”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419799">Further, we know that after a catastrophic accident causing, for example, a life-altering injury, suicidal ideation is very common, but with the proper support it goes away and a happy and purposeful life can resume. Moreover, it takes much longer in many cases to get a wheelchair or quality specialized rehabilitation care than the 90 days, so I ask this: What good is 90 days if someone is not able to access alternatives in that time period? I do not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419800">Additionally, Conservatives believe we can better protect vulnerable patients by requiring the patients to be the ones who first request information on medical assistance in dying, and not have it openly or flippantly offered to a patient as a standard everyday option like pain medication or various therapies. Conservatives believe MAID is an extremely serious matter and should not be something pushed on patients in their most vulnerable state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419801">Whenever members on this side of the House state the potential for pressure to be put on patients concerning MAID, I do find, during these debates, that Liberal members essentially roll their eyes. They scoff and say that never happens, while the justice committee heard something different. It heard first-hand from witness accounts that pressure does, in fact, happen and has been happening over the past four and a half years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419802">Roger Foley is an infamous example of this pressure. He was offered MAID on four separate occasions to date and never once indicated that he was interested. In fact, he indicated quite the opposite. When he was having a bad day it was offered to him. It was almost as if they were tempting him by saying there is an easier way and suggesting he should just end it all. I just find that terrifying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419803">I find Roger's case very alarming. Safeguards must be put in place to ensure that when people are at their weakest and most vulnerable moments, they are not offered something that would end their lives forever, but rather are provided various options for better care and support, if they want it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419804">Another issue I have with this bill is that it moves to expand MAID so quickly. Really, this MAID legislation's original framework was just legalized four and a half years ago, which is really a blink of an eye in relative terms. The original legislation was thoroughly researched and vetted, and numerous safeguards were put in place to ensure our most vulnerable were protected. Those safeguards were considered critical at the time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419805">Now, less than five years later, the Liberal government is massively expanding MAID and doing away with many of those safeguards it itself deemed critical in the first legislation not even five years ago. At this pace, I very much believe and fear that we may be debating expanding MAID for children or those with mental health issues within my lifetime, and I find that absolutely terrifying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419806">More than that, this legislation comes before the mandatory five-year review. I feel that without that we are flying blind without the proper data that could have been revealed in a comprehensive review. There are simple questions I would have hoped would have been assessed in that review, such as these: “Who is taking MAID?”; “Is it mostly the elderly or the poor?”; “Is it racialized communities or wealthier white people?”; “Is MAID affecting certain demographics?”; “Why those demographics?”; “Are there reoccurring themes for choosing MAID that could be addressed by providing better care during suffering at end of life, rather than death?”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419807">We should be doing everything we can as legislators to provide alternatives to MAID that are reliable and easily accessible to everyone, yet the current government is not doing that at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419808">What I find interesting on this is that the current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> is responsible for this aggressive expansion of MAID. He, in fact, voted against his own government's Liberal legislation on MAID, the original one four and a half years ago, because he believed it did not go far enough. We have known for a long time what his position is, and that leads me to question whether the Liberal consultations on this bill were really impartial. It may explain why this legislation goes far beyond what the Quebec superior court judge called for in the Truchon ruling.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6419809">There are so many questions with this new freedom Canadians have with MAID. I firmly believe we have the responsibility as legislators to proceed on ending the lives of Canadians with extreme caution. There is a profound shift happening in our society concerning MAID, and we must proceed thoughtfully and with thorough, exhaustive research, which has not happened with this expansion of MAID. For me, this expansion, to put it plainly, is too much, too fast, too soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419810">Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> would remove other critical safeguards as well, such as the requirement to have two independent witnesses sign off on MAID for a patient. This safeguard helps to prevent abuse and coercion of MAID and provided much-needed oversight on those discussions with patients. To think a person needs two independent witnesses to sign off on a will, but not to end their actual life, makes me feel as though we are living in the twilight zone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419811">Further, Conservatives have advocated for amendments that would ensure physicians who sign off on MAID applications have expertise in a patient's condition. One would think that for a life-ending decision such as MAID, the safeguard would be a given, but no, the Liberals disagree, and again for reasons largely unknown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419812">Additionally, a number of constituents have reached out to me with significant concerns that health care professionals who do not agree with the morality of MAID would be forced to help administer it. The Liberals have insisted that this will not be the case and that the conscience rights of health care professionals will be protected. However, communication on that has been dismal, to say the least, otherwise I would not be receiving so many calls about it. I urge the Liberal government to invest more time and energy into communicating on this specific issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419813">I will end with a quote from the over 1,000 doctors who I have mentioned throughout my remarks. They said:</ParaText>

Mr. Truchon was born with cerebral palsy. He no longer had the use of his limbs. In 2012, he lost the use of his only working limb, his left arm, due to severe spinal stenosis, which left him almost completely paralyzed and caused painful spasms. He had given up most of his activities and gone into assisted living since there was little left that he could do by himself.

              <ParaText id="6419838">Madam Speaker, I wonder if the member could speak about the issue of contemporaneous consent and the fact that the legislation would not even require people to be asked on the day they are receiving MAID. We had a Conservative amendment that would have at least required people to be asked on the day. Is that not the minimum of what would be reasonable?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6419840">Madam Speaker, we are now at the third reading stage of <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. This means all the amendments that will be considered by the House have now been considered, and we must now pronounce on the final version of the bill and its effects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419841">Before I speak about this bill in final form, I want to respond directly to what I see as the government's principal argument for this legislation and other similar legislation. It tells us this is all about choice: the choice of individuals to live as they choose and die as they choose. The idea is that moral judgments about good living and good dying ought to be made by the person doing the living and dying, as opposed to by someone else, because the individual is uniquely qualified to make judgments about their own happiness and someone outside their skin simply cannot make those judgments as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419842">This is the one serious argument people use to advance this bill and others like it. We should of course appreciate the existence of other unserious arguments, such as the assertion that, “The courts told us to,” or, “This is what people we have consulted told us to do.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419843">A small part of this bill responds to a lower court decision, but most of it has been invented, out of thin air, by the government and whoever it consulted or did not consult. Over a thousand physicians have signed a letter opposing this bill, and every single disability rights organization that has spoken out about this bill has spoken in opposition to it. These are unserious arguments stemming from unserious readings of court decisions and unserious consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419844">The serious argument made in support of this bill, as I have stated, is that people ought to have the choice to make decisions about their living and dying because they know what will lead to their happiness better than anyone else. This is the argument, but we should also notice how those who use this argument ultimately choose to apply it selectively. Even while suggesting it is all about choice, they insist on changing the words we use to describe the choice in order to make us feel better about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419845">The phrase “medical assistance in dying” was invented at the time Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was proposed, and is not a phrase used in other countries to describe the phenomenon of doctors killing their patients. If this is really about choice, why do we have to invent new pseudo-terms to make ourselves feel better about that choice?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419846">If I asked members point-blank whether they think a person should be able to commit suicide, I am sure many would respond that this is not suicide. It is completely different, as it is medical assistance in dying. Formally, what is meant by medical assistance in dying is facilitated suicide, or killing in a medical context. We claim to be focused on choice, but we still are uncomfortable enough with the choice that we have to invent new words to describe it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419847">Some members do not like the use of the word “euthanasia” to describe the phenomenon of doctors and nurses killing their patients after being asked to do so. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> told the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights that phrases “referring to this bill as 'euthanasia' legislation, which I have heard in the House of Commons, are incredibly demeaning to the dignity of people”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419848">The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> may be interested to know the word euthanasia actually comes from two Greek words: “<I>eu</I>”, meaning well, and “<I>thanatos</I>”, meaning death. The term euthanasia means “good death”, and is itself a sanitization of the concept of killing. If the term is misleading, it is not because it is too harsh but because it is too gentle. As we have heard, not all cases of assisted suicide can reasonably be called good deaths by any definition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419849">Notice that the word euthanasia is never used to describe the administration of the death penalty. The term was invented in order to sanitize the idea of the medicalized killing of a consenting person. It is instructive that a sanitized term for this practice, once people had a full social awareness of its meaning and reality, had to be replaced by a new sanitized term to further obscure the true nature of what is taking place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419850">No doubt, in 20 or 30 years, the term MAID will be thought gauche and replaced with another, more up-to-date sanitization of a term that no longer makes us feel better about something we naturally feel uncomfortable about. The point is that if this all about choice, and if we are comfortable with this choice, why are we not comfortable speaking plainly about sick people committing suicide and about doctors killing their patients when asked to do so? Would that not be a more plain and accurate description of the choice that many wish to defend?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419851">If there is a practice or activity that people are uncomfortable seeing depicted or hearing described accurately, perhaps we should ask ourselves why we feel uncomfortable instead of demanding that the images and descriptions be put aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419852">Members should observe as well that the idea of a choice to die, or a right to die, is being advocated for selectively. Some people have a right to die and some people do not, apparently, so we have to ask why this principle is being selectively applied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419853">Suppose that I, an able-bodied healthy white man, experienced some great personal tragedy such as the death of a child or the breakup of my marriage. It is possible that following such an event I might start to experience extreme existential pain and suicidal ideation. If I then went to a doctor to share the feelings I was experiencing, I would not be presented with MAID as a way out of the challenges I was facing. The way I look, my health status and other characteristics I have would signal to the doctor that my life was worth living. We know it to be true that when a young, able-bodied person chooses to die, those around them will say, “What a tragedy. He had so much to live for.” </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6419854">The argument for a choice to die does not apply to those who society believes should not choose to die, even if such people are sincere in their expression of pain, in their sense that their pain is irremediable and in their desire not to continue living, but what if a person who is older, who is disabled, who does not fit the stereotypical social mould of someone who has a lot to live for, presents themself to the health care system experiencing existential pain and suicidal ideation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419855">We know from testimony from the justice committee that people in this situation are offered and even pressured to opt for MAID. People who are elderly or living with disabilities are often offered and pushed to take MAID without asking for it. This is the testimony given over and over again at the justice committee and confirmed by the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">minister responsible for disability inclusion</Affiliation>, who acknowledged how concerned she is about people with disabilities being regularly and proactively offered MAID that they do not want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419856">We see here an important and revealing contradiction in the application of the principle of choice. For some in society, death is seen as an unreasonable choice and is actively discouraged. For others, death is seen as a desirable choice and is actively encouraged. This is not just a debate about choice, therefore. Rather, it is a debate about how the architecture of choice is set up differently for different people, based on whether others assess their lives as being worth living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419857">This is what leaders in the disability community are deeply concerned about: how this legislation includes them and only them in the additional category of those for whom we think death is a reasonable course of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419858">Suppose that of my four children one had a disability and suppose that I taught three of my children to always press on because life is beautiful, but I told the fourth child that they should consider death if they ever faced circumstance that they could not handle. Do colleagues think that situation would make my fourth child feel privileged by the special offer of choice or do colleagues think she would feel devalued by the fact that I thought death was uniquely an option for her, based on the presumption that her life was not worth living?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419859">Choices do not exist in a social vacuum. When we speak about choice, we recognize that people are making choices between available options and the nature of those available options is constructed by the society in which they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419860">I used to think that people were always better off with more options, that just like a menu at a restaurant, we are always better off with more options available to us: the longer the menu, the better. If I do not like any of the new options available, then no problem. I do not have to choose them, but I should not begrudge other people the opportunity to have more choices available to them, even if I do not like those choices. Nobody is made worse off by the lengthening of the menu. Then I realized that it was not that simple. If I am in a restaurant and the only options available are chicken or beef then, arguably, yes, I am better off with the addition of more items on the menu; a fish option, a vegetarian dish, etc., but there is also a case in which the existence of certain options on the menu fundamentally changes the nature of the experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419861"> Suppose that while travelling, I encounter a restaurant that offers a human flesh sandwich in addition to the usual fare. It is fairly safe that I would not stay and order in that restaurant even if I had no intention of ordering the human flesh sandwich. It is unlikely that any members of this House would feel comfortable eating in such a restaurant, even if all they planned to eat was the filet mignon. That example illustrates the way that the offer of an additional option can actually change one's entire experience of a place or environment. A person with a disability who is offered death has a very different experience of health care from a person who is consistently offered life-affirming care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419862">The fact that people are offered or encouraged toward certain choices, and that some people are offered those choices and others are not, changes the entire experience of health care for many people. Part of the response to this brave new world of so-called medical assistance in dying is that people are seeking safe spaces where they can receive care that is life-affirming. There are still many people in this country who have about as much interest in receiving care in an environment where death is being offered as they do in eating at a restaurant where cannibalism is offered. Such people should be free to receive care in a hospice where life is the only choice and where they feel safe from the possibility of pressure of a momentary weakness or from the sense that they are an unnecessary burden. Some are still looking for care that is animated by the conviction that all lives are always worth living, but perversely, those who claim to champion choice are actually attacking these safe spaces. With the absence of conscience protection in this or any other legislation like it, doctors are being forced out of their profession and life-affirming hospice care is being shut down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419863">We wonder why we have a crisis in long-term care in this country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that so many of the people in organizations that have historically operated in this space are being pushed out because of a lack of conscience protection. Protecting the conscience rights of physicians and institutions is not just about the rights of providers. It is about the right, indeed the choice, of patients to receive care in a certain kind of environment if that is their desire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419864">I know from the many conversations that I have had with constituents, including those who are very supportive of the expansion of MAID, that the present realities of the social architecture of choice are top of mind for them during their advocacy. In other words, they want more euthanasia because they find the alternative intolerable. An absence of good care, an absence of effective pain management, an absence of support to live in a way that accords with their sense of dignity and a sense of resignation about these realities leaves them to want to be able to end it all, rather than endure under undesirable conditions, but those conditions could themselves be changed. The expansion of euthanasia, along with continuing pressure on all health care institutions to offer it, will further erode the life-affirming nature of care that people receive.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6419865">I remember once having a long conversation with a constituent who explained to me her reasons for advocating for expanded euthanasia. She emphasized the classic arguments about choice and control, and then shared with me a story of being in a care situation and struggling to have a bowel movement unaided. She went to the nursing station for help, and unfortunately was met with a gruff and unempathetic response. Her memory of the sense of indignity she felt, struggling for a long time on her own, and then seeking the help of a person who seemed uncaring and disgusted, was clearly a part of her thought process about the circumstances under which she would want to die.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419866">While I can identify with her feelings in the moment, I think the solution is to give people the choice of compassionate care. It is a tragedy that people are considering death because of moments of perceived indignity that can be quite directly resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419867">Many older people who are considering death say that they do not want to be a burden on others. This is expressed as a matter of choice, but it is also revealing about the architecture of choice. It is generally unheard of for children to insist on paying rent to their parents or living independently because they do not want to be a burden. Certainly, I have never heard such sentiments from my children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419868">Why are elderly people made to feel like they might be a burden, while children are not? Again, this is an issue of social context. If children were constantly told from a young age that they were a great burden to their parents, that they were costing them money that could be spent on other things, and that they were interrupting their social lives, then children would likely start to worry about being a burden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419869">Conversely, if seniors and people with disabilities were constantly affirmed for their value and their ability to contribute to society, constantly told that they hold the key to our future rather than constantly being told about the burden they impose, then of course they would be more likely to choose life instead of death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419870">This is not just a question of choice. It is a question of the social architecture of choice that leads people to make different choices in different kinds of situations based on the limited options in front of them and based on the way that different options impact each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419871">To underline this with one further point, it should not escape the notice of members that the government's Bill <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">C-6</Document>, the proposed ban on conversion therapy, is built on the premise that people cannot consent to something that is contrary to their human dignity. Although I have concerns about the text of Bill <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">C-6</Document> as written, I agree with the principle that conversion therapy is wrong and should not be allowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419872">In light of both Bill <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">C-6</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, it remains unclear to me what the government's view is on the ability of a person to consent to harm. Is it the view of the government that people should be able to voluntarily consent to things that harm them? Looking at these bills together, we might conclude the government finds it okay for people to consent to death but not okay for people to consent to certain things that are deemed worse than death. However, this subjective categorization of certain harms as being worse than others clearly may contradict an individual's own subjective sense of what things are more harmful than others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419873">It is time for us, as parliamentarians, to talk about the choices that elderly people and people living with disabilities have in front of them, and to give them options besides death, to move from a narrow focus on questions of choice to a discussion of the architecture of choice that puts people in impossible and painful situations. A good society is not just one that gives people the formal right to make choices between different alternatives. It is one that ensures that those alternatives are sufficiently robust so that individuals are able to make choices that truly lead to happiness. Of course not all choices lead to happiness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419874"> People can make choices that they think will lead to happiness, but do not. This is especially serious when a decision is final and irreversible. The wider community has a reasonable interest in ensuring that a person making that choice has at least all of the information in front of them, taking into consideration the fact that people can and often do adapt to new circumstances over time. A belief in the pursuit of happiness entails a belief in freedom but also a belief in the value of encouraging the considered use of freedom through due reflection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419875"> Having reflected on the application of the concept of choice in this context, I would now like to make a few additional comments about the provisions of this bill and the timing of it. This bill proposes to eliminate the requirement that death be reasonably foreseeable for those seeking euthanasia and puts those for whom death is not reasonably foreseeable on a second track with some distinct requirements. The reconsideration of the question of reasonable foreseeability was provoked by a court decision in Quebec, the Truchon decision, which the government could have chosen to appeal but did not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419876">This bill deals with more than this question. It also arbitrarily eliminates a number of safeguards that have nothing to do with the Truchon decision. It eliminates the 10-day reflection period. It reduces the required number of witnesses. It eliminates the requirement for contemporaneous consent. The removal of the 10-day reflection period in particular has led experts to point out that this opens the door to same-day death, to a situation where a patient could request and receive euthanasia on the same day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419877">Some members of this House have strenuously objected to the use of this term. Same-day death is a jarring idea that someone's worst day could be their last, and that temporary suicidal ideation could lead to immediate death. However, those who find this term uncomfortable must face up to the fact that the legislation as written contains no parameters for those for whom death is deemed reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419878">If members believe that time parameters exist, then they should point to where they exist in law. If members believe that time parameters should exist, then they should have supported their reintroduction into the bill. As the law stands before us now, there are no legislated requirements around timelines for those for whom death is reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419879">At third reading, members must choose whether or not they will vote for same-day death in Canada. As Wilberforce said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419881">The Conservatives have proposed reasonable amendments to reintroduce the reflection period, introduce a shorter reflection period and reintroduce requirements around contemporaneous consent and independent witnesses, in particular, recognizing the different experiences people with disabilities have reported with respect to the health care system. We also introduced a requirement that health care practitioners only discuss euthanasia if it is brought up by the patient first. These safeguards matter and would protect vulnerable people by reducing their risk of being rushed and pressured into vulnerable situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419882">In response to our call for safeguards, the government said it trusts health care practitioners and these rules are not required. The purpose of a safeguard is not to respond to what may be the average case, but to establish a minimum standard. We are talking about 100,000 people in this country whose professional qualifications would allow them to administer euthanasia. Are those 100,000 so uniquely virtuous or trustworthy they do not need laws to regulate their behaviour while the rest of us do? I believe most people in medicine are doing their best to selflessly serve others, but one needs only listen to the testimony at the justice committee to realize some of those who are providing health care have fallen short of that call. All of us need laws to regulate our behaviour to some extent. If we need regulations, then how can we expect those 100,000 people to be different? Are there no bad apples? I am not arguing they should be subject to unique suspicion, but that they simply need rules and laws to guide their actions like the rest of us do. People charged with taking another person's life should do so within strictly defined parameters for their own good and that of everyone else. I trust doctors just as I trust police officers, but they still need regulations and oversight. We recognize there are some bad apples on our police forces and if we need safeguards for police officers in light of their power to take life, then we also need safeguards for those in power to take life in a medical context. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419883">The government has been working very hard to push the narrative about timing, claiming the Conservatives are responsible for delaying this bill. It should stand to reason that if the government wants us to invest in rapidly passing its bill, it must proceed to persuade us that it is a good bill, which it has not done. The Truchon decision requires a response, but matters would be much simpler if the bill only focused on a response to Truchon instead of a variety of other changes. As it is, we are forced to consider all of the elements together, not just the narrow part that responds to Truchon. This is the government's choice, not ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419884">Let us also take stock of how we have come so close to the court deadline. This legislation was presented in February. In May and June, the Conservatives wanted the House to sit in a modified form, but the government refused to allow it. Then it killed its own bill by proroguing in August. All of these moves pushed us into the mid-fall before the bill was considered. It then received a mere four meetings of witness testimony at the justice committee. The government's approach to this legislation has been to delay until the last minute and then demand urgency instead of a considered review. Let us be clear that this is a political tactic designed to subject these radical changes to as little debate as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419885">As a high school student, I had the honour of participating in a special MLA for a Day program at the Alberta legislature. At one of our meetings, a seasoned Progressive Conservative minister explained to us how legislation was passed. Students were surprised by the length and complexity of the process. They asked why it took so long and could the process not be shortened a bit. The minister told us he was glad it took so long because one of the fastest pieces of legislation to ever pass in the Alberta legislature was the Sexual Sterilization Act of 1928, which allowed the government to sterilize people with disabilities against their will based on the analysis that they imposed an undue burden on society. Legislators at that time should have taken more time to listen to people with disabilities and considered the implications of what they were doing. The point that when we are in too much of a hurry to make decisions we risk undermining the fundamental rights of our fellow human beings, in particular, those living with disabilities, has stuck with me to this day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419886">Those of us on this side of the House who are raising concerns and demanding that time be taken to consider this bill and appropriate safeguards be put in place are on the right side of history. As was the case with the Sexual Sterilization Act of 1928, when this bill is repealed in five or 50 years, I will proudly tell my grandchildren that I took a stand for the universal immutable dignity of every human being.</ParaText>

We could have been considering it earlier if they had not prorogued, and we could have allowed the justice committee to take the time that was necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419892">There were four meetings of witness testimony. Conservatives put forward motions to ask that we have five, that we have one more meeting, given the overwhelming concern in opposition. We had many briefs submitted by medical practitioners that were initially rejected because of some arbitrary timeline that was not even published. It was only after a motion from the member for <Affiliation DbId="252830" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> that those briefs were allowed to be translated and presented, but even at that point they were distributed long after the consideration of amendments had started.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419895">In order to pursue a medically assisted death, a person must satisfy the following eligibility criteria: They must be, of course, of majority age. They must be able to make health care decisions for themselves. They must make a voluntary request for MAID that is not the result of external pressure, for example, from a health care professional or a family member. They must give informed consent after they have received all of the information they need to make their decision, including a medical diagnosis, available forms of treatment and available options to relieve suffering including palliative care. They must have a grievous and irremediable medical condition, meaning that the person has a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability, is in an advanced state of decline in capabilities that cannot be reversed, and experiences unbearable physical or physiological suffering from an illness, disease or state of decline that cannot be relieved under conditions that the person considers acceptable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419897">Madam Speaker, again, there is a bit of a conflation of a few issues here. The member spoke about eligibility criteria. There are eligibility criteria, there are safeguards to ensure that those eligibility criteria are actually being met in a considered way, and there is also a question of context. Do people have those alternatives?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419898">For instance, if a person is suffering in a grievous and irremediable way because they have not had access to care that would address their suffering, they may meet the eligibility criteria. However, there is a problem there in terms of context, in the fact that they are making a decision based on limited options because the system has not provided them with the care that they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419899">In terms of the safeguards, we have heard so much at the justice committee, and I encourage the member to look at the testimony from people with disabilities who talked about situations of being pressured and being told that they were selfish for not wanting to pursue this path. We have cases of pressure. Clearly, those are problems and, in principle, members would say that obviously that should not happen. However, the fact is that it is happening right now and the people who are involved in that pressure have not been prosecuted and have not been disciplined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419900"> The government has held up that nobody has been prosecuted under this law so that means it is working well. Given that we have testimony saying it is not working well and there have been no consequences for those who are involved in abuses, that suggests the safeguards as they exist are failing. The government wants to take away more safeguards without addressing some of the context issues. My focus is on addressing the issues of context and the issues of safeguards in order to protect people who are vulnerable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419903">Madam Speaker, it has been wonderful to hear members at different points in this debate speak about the excellent work being done in their ridings by those who are accompanying people in their last days and seeking to provide good-quality palliative care. It is a tragedy that most Canadians do not have access to that and that many Canadians are offered death long before they are able to receive those things that will allow them to effectively manage their pain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419904">This is a choice that we have to make as legislators. We have to look at the architecture of the choice in front of people. As I said, it is not just about giving people choices. It is about asking what the options are that people have and saying if we pull everything out of that life option, if we do not have proper palliative care, if we do not have effective end-of-life supports for people, if we do not have effective pain management, and then say the only option is death or pain, that obviously is not a desirable choice. What we can do is help people get out of that choice by offering an alternative. If people's only options are pain or death, that is not a good place to be. That is not a place we want people to be in and the technology exists for better pain management than the vast majority of Canadians are receiving right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419905">We have had multiple bills in the last five years on expediting the death side of it, but not dealing with the life side of it.

              <ParaText id="6419910">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to address the House on this very important issue and to continue to act as a voice for those who continue to be ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419911">The government is acting as if rushing the legislation through in order to meet the Truchon deadline is its number one priority. Canadians are suffering because of the pandemic, and while people and businesses continue to fall through the cracks, the government is prioritizing expanding access to euthanasia over providing Canadians with the support they need. Shockingly, it is rushing the bill through before the mandated five-year review of the euthanasia regime in Canada has even taken place. This is reckless and this recklessness will cost people their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419912">The Truchon decision is not a binding legal decision for the House of Commons, but the government is choosing to act as though it is, despite calls from this side of the House to appeal it. When we are dealing with something this serious, with stakes as high as life and death, it is imperative that the process is not rushed by a lower provincial court decision. Our vulnerable citizens deserve better. In all honesty, this deadline is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419913">Amazingly, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> would not only expand access to euthanasia to those for whom death is not reasonably foreseeable, but goes beyond Truchon by eliminating necessary safeguards that are in place to protect the vulnerable. By removing the 10-day reflection period, people nearing the end of their lives can receive medical assistance in dying on the very same day they request it. That means, in essence, for many Canadians, their worst day will be their last day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419914">I would like to point out an important statistic from the “First Annual Report on Medical Assistance in Dying in Canada” presented in 2019. In this report, it states that as of the date of its release, 263 Canadians who had requested MAID ended up withdrawing their requests. Because of the current 10-day waiting period, 263 Canadian lives were saved. It is clear these people felt they wanted to die on the day the request was made, but decided days later that they wanted to keep on living. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419915">Had the 10-day reflection period not been in place, 263 Canadians would have had their lives ended prematurely. Maybe it was a phone call from an old friend, meeting with a family member or good news from their physician that caused them to change their minds. It does not matter. The point is that they did. Why does the government want to rob Canadians of the opportunity to make that decision? It justifies the need for Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> with the Truchon decision, but where in Truchon does it say that? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419916">Another important safeguard that Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> seeks to eliminate is the requirement for final consent. This is one that truly frightens me. The reasoning behind the removal of this safeguard is the fact that a person may lose the capacity to consent to euthanasia before it is carried out if a person's illness advances causing significant cognitive decline. Therefore, people can give advance consent to have their lives ended should they lose the capacity to make such a difficult decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419917">It fascinates me that we all agree that if a person is unable to provide advance consent to sexual activity, and that person is taken advantage of when not having capacity to say no, a crime has been committed. However, the government believes people can provide advance consent to have their lives ended, even if they lose the capacity to say no when the procedure takes place. The problem with the principle of advance consent is that it is impossible to know what people's desires are if they are unable to communicate them. We cannot know if a person in that state truly wants to die. Maybe the individual has had a change of heart and wishes to keep on living at the time MAID is administered, but just can't say that. That is horrifying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419918">The risks associated with the removal of the 10-day reflection period and the requirement for final consent are too serious for me to accept. We should remember that the stakes are as high as life and death. The government needs to protect vulnerable Canadians. It needs to ensure safeguards are in place. The removal of these safeguards puts their lives in danger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419919">I would like to remind the government of the voices it ignored in its rush to meet this unnecessary deadline, the voices of disabled Canadians, their doctors and advocates. I remind members of the words of Krista Carr, the executive director of Inclusion Canada, who said that this bill is disabled Canadians' “worst nightmare”. There are also the words of Catherine Frazee, who said that the bill tells people like her that their lives are not worth living.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419920">How about Dr. Heidi Janz? She told the justice committee that the bill “will result in people with disabilities seeking MAID as an ultimate capitulation to a lifetime of ableist oppression.” Roger Foley bravely told the committee from his hospital bed that, if the bill passes, he will not survive and the Parliament of Canada will have his blood on its hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419921">I am here in the House to remind the government of the words they refused to listen to. The stream of euthanasia access for those who are not dying is ableist and dangerous. These are not my words. These are their words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419922">Doctors who work with disabled Canadians made it very clear at committee that a 90-day waiting period is simply not enough time.

It is in this compromised state that the government wishes to offer death to Canadians. I will also remind the House of the government's absolute failure to provide disabled Canadians with the care they need. I remind the House that it often takes much longer than 90 days to even see a specialist. I remind the House what the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> told the justice committee: It is easier to receive MAID in this country than it is to receive a wheelchair.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419934">Gabrielle Peters, a journalist who lives with a spinal cord injury, wrote the following in a recent open letter to Canadian senators. “I know that Bill C7 must be stopped because I know passage of this bill will result in preventable deaths of disabled people. I know this because I know those already happen. I know they already happen because I was almost one of them.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419935">The government is rushing to eliminate safeguards for euthanasia when the current safeguards are not even being adhered to. According to bioethicist Dr. Jaro Kotalik, it is evident provincial and territorial authorities are not fully engaged in their role of monitoring, enforcing and reporting on the performance of the MAID program, which they are expected to do according to federal laws and regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419936">This is clear from Roger Foley's testimony to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. His caregivers, who he depends on for every comfort and necessity of life, have suggested four times that he opt for MAID. Roger's death is not reasonably foreseeable, so this is completely illegal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419937">It is incredible that on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, every Liberal MP voted against protections for persons with disabilities being added to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. Even the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Disability Inclusion</Affiliation>, who expressed in the Senate pre-study that she shares some of the concerns of disabled Canadians, voted against our amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419938">Let me remind the House what the UN special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities said on her visit to Canada: “I am extremely concerned about the implementation of the legislation on medical assistance in dying from a disability perspective. I have been informed that there is no protocol in place to demonstrate that persons with disabilities have been provided with viable alternatives when eligible for assistive dying.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419939">The opposition tried to address that concern by moving an amendment in committee requiring that patients have meaningful access to care before MAID can be administered. I remind the House that the Liberal members voted it down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419940">Let me share another concern raised by the rapporteur. She said, “I have further received worrisome claims about persons with disabilities in institutions being pressured to seek medical assistance in dying, and practitioners not formally reporting cases involving persons with disabilities.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419941">Earlier I referenced the 2019 Health Canada report on MAID. While some of the statistics therein were helpful, there were clearly some issues with the report, namely the lack of any mention of abuse. The information collected was self-reported by MAID providers, so uncovering abuses was unlikely. We know there has been abuse; that much is clear. Cases like Roger Foley's, as well as those of many others, make this undeniable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419942">Archie Rolland, 18 months before his death by MAID, was transferred against his will from a residence that provided highly specialized care to a geriatric long-term care facility that could not meet his needs. He said that it was not the illness that was killing him. He was tired of fighting for compassionate care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419943">Sean Tagert, a father with ALS, exhausted from battling for the care he needed to live at home, was told he would have to be placed in a long-term care centre hours away from his home community and family. He was unable to live the remainder of his days at home with his young son and felt the only option was MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419944">There are also the stories of Alan Nichols, Yvon Tremblay, Gabriel Bouchard, Tommy Sec, Jonathan Marchand, Raymond Bourbonnais, Candice Lewis and far too many more. Some of these people are still fighting for their lives and some of them already gave in to the pressure to die. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419945">Why are there so many horror stories? Why is there such a lack of compliance? It is simple: There is a lack of oversight. Many doctors and family members of patients have told me their complaints lie dead in the water. There also exists a culture of severe bullying in medicine, so doctors are scared to speak up out of fear of losing their jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419947">When I last spoke to the bill, the <Affiliation DbId="253813" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation> asked me if I knew of any cases of pressure that led to prosecution. There are plenty of cases of pressure, just no prosecution. When complaints are made about abuse, there is virtually no avenue for recourse. If someone complains to the police, they are blocked from investigating by doctor-patient confidentiality. When complaints are made to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, they are not followed up on. Many doctors feel cowed into submission before complaints are ever made in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419948">I attempted to find out from the Legislative Library of British Columbia how many complaints were lodged against doctors with B.C.'s College of Physicians and Surgeons regarding MAID. The response I got is as follows. “The College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. cannot disclose the existence of a patient complaint against a physician, unless the complaint leads to formal discipline. Therefore, the exact number of complaints to the college, whether related to MAID or not, is not possible to ascertain using public sources.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419949">The response went on to offer me a media scan of newspaper stories related to MAID complaints in the hopes this would be helpful. Imagine that: The only place where any information is publicly available on MAID complaints is in the media. Shame on us. Imagine the cases of elder abuse that are happening under this easy-to-cheat scheme. We have millions of elderly Canadians with no protection from this regime because there is absolutely no way of monitoring it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419950">Imagine the cases like that of my constituents, who attended a town hall I held when the MAID survey was open for submissions. Together with almost 100 people, we went through each question attempting to understand and respond in a thoughtful way. The more questions we answered, the more we all realized the issue was far too complicated and nuanced for a survey to be of any good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419951">Then a young father stood up and told his own story of being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. In the town hall, he explained how he had become depressed following his diagnosis and sought counselling to help him cope with his new reality. Instead, his counsellor offered him MAID. He was shocked that in his darkest hour a professional counsellor would suggest the very thing that was extremely tempting for him, but not in alignment with his ultimate goal to live his best life to its natural conclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419952">The medical professional on our panel was shocked. This was completely illegal under current law and should have been reported, to which the young man said this: How does one even report it? Imagine that: This man, whose life was put in jeopardy, was completely unaware of even how to report the incident. The doctor said he could go online and write a complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and told him to do it right away. The young man replied that he did not have the energy. He was going through chemotherapy and was absolutely exhausted. He could not wrap his mind around anything extra at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6419953">How many people are out there right now who either do not know who to file a complaint with or just do not have the energy or strength in them to fight? They are already fighting a battle with death and now we want them to go online and file a complaint they may not live to see to its conclusion.</ParaText>

I wonder if my friend and colleague could comment on how this bill greatly diminishes the safeguards. He talked about how they were carefully crafted in a way that respected the democratic process in the last Parliament. Could he talk about how some of those safeguards have been reduced or completely eliminated in the bill, which go beyond the court decision that the government uses as justification for the bill it has introduced?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6419999">Madam Speaker, that is exactly right. The crafters of this bill like to tell us in Parliament and Canadians that they were forced to do it, that a lower court forced their hand to come up with this legislation. However, in many cases, as my hon. colleagues have pointed out and as the former minister of justice who is now an independent member has noted, this bill goes far beyond the court ruling. It would remove safeguards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420000"> For example, the 10-day reflection period is gone. Other important safeguards have been removed. This will have an impact, I believe. It will have a grisly impact over time as medically assisted death becomes just a push to death in some corners as people are forced to consider things they would not have otherwise considered. I worry about this. I worry about it for those Canadians who are in a vulnerable position or near their end of life or even people who have given up for a brief time. Often, we know, with health care and with better care, that people can rebound, not always, and I know there are tough cases out there, but this legislation will send us in the wrong direction on these important questions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420001">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to enter into debate on such an important subject. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420002">The first thing I would like to address is the comments that the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and other members of the government have been making that somehow the Conservatives are holding this bill up, that we are somehow responsible for this delay. I will expand on this, but there is really one word that completely rejects that argument, “prorogation”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420003">The government came forward with the legislation before. It certainly will not surprise any of my constituents, but when the government used its excuse for the need for a legislative reset, it just happened to coincide with the day that very revealing documents were to be released relating to an unprecedented scandal the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and various members of the government were facing, it prorogued Parliament, resetting the legislative agenda, because of COVID, they claimed. Now many of the bills they introduced in the previous Parliament have been reintroduced in this Parliament. Then they make it about the Conservatives somehow holding up the process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420004">We are 24 days behind in the legislative process during which we could have dealt with this legislation and many of the other important things, COVID-related and otherwise, yet here we are. The words that come to mind about it are not necessarily parliamentary, but it is a shame that we find ourselves in this position and that members on the government side would suggest we are somehow not doing our jobs by debating legislation that is literally about life and death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420005">Constituents will hold government members to account on this subject. I have heard often from those concerned on all sides of this issue. I will get to some of the comments that the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has made more recently. There is the need for dialogue, discussion and careful consideration so we can strike the right balance. That is why Parliament exists, the hallowed chamber that we all have the honour and privilege of sitting in,so we can have discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420006">I would love to see the composition of the House changed a little with respect to the numbers of seats that particular parties have. I am certainly doing my best to ensure that happens, and there is some encouraging news on that front. However, it is interesting that the people who Canadians send to this place, regardless of the composition, is due to the importance of the dialogue associated with every aspect of our jobs here, whether it be COVID-related, or related to medical assistance in dying, as we are debating today, or the many other issues that come before this chamber and its committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420007">We cannot diminish the requirement for us to do our due diligence in every aspect of the word. I am certainly doing my part in this debate and resoundingly rejecting the government saying that somehow the Conservatives are delaying this. The blame for that lies directly on the desks of the members of the Liberal government. They are manufacturing urgency when the reason there is even urgency to begin with is due to carefully crafted political games by members of the government opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420008">As listened to the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> talk about Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> over the course of specifically the last number of weeks, there has been an evolution in his responses. The last time I participated in debate was from my constituency office and the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, the day before, had talked about how the Liberals had found broad consensus on this issue, that they had come together and done what the people had asked them to do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420009">He bragged about the 300,000 submissions to the consultations, when I know for a fact, and I mentioned this in my last speech, that the position the government came to was certainly different from many of the consults my constituents sent in, which did not seem to be acknowledged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420010">I find it very interesting that when the minister answered yesterday, there was a change in his tone. The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> referred to this as a sensitive subject. He was much more nuanced in his approach, acknowledging that there is wide disagreement on it, but that Conservatives should hurry it up. I am paraphrasing, but the change in the minister's tone is a clear example that the Liberals' hands have been slapped. The Liberals claim to have consensus on an issue when it is clear they do not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420011">We have disability rights advocates and medical professionals who certainly seem to have a wide consensus, although I will not go so far as to say it is universal, as that is an inappropriate use of a term with such a broad application. However, there seems to be a tremendous amount of consensus, not universal, that this bill is flawed and deserves due consideration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420012">That is exactly what this institution's role is, whether it is us or the other place debating Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. I imagine the bill will pass. At second reading and report stage we certainly saw the bill pass, so I anticipate that we will see a similar result and that the other place will also have the opportunity to go through the dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420013">I do want to talk about how we are facing a tragic irony. The Government of Canada, like governments around the world, like provincial governments and like municipal governments, has poured trillions of dollars into COVID response programs. It is without question that those who are most at risk and most vulnerable among us for this virus, which has gripped our world over the last number of months, or close to a year, are seniors. I find it tragically ironic that, in the legislative reset supposedly prioritizing COVID, we would be debating this bill, which puts some of our most vulnerable at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420014">While governments have poured trillions of dollars, in many cases rightfully so, into COVID relief and response programs, we are here debating a bill that would allow people to end their lives and reduce safeguards on a decision that can be no more final. That tragic irony brings us to today. The government members will talk about the need, and often they criticize Conservatives' debate on many aspects of the COVID response, yet here they are pushing for something that is the antithesis of what all parliamentarians would certainly say is trying to do what is best for constituents, which is doing what is best for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420015">Often the constitutionality of this place is forgotten, and the reality that the highest elected office in this land is not that of the prime minister, but that of the member of Parliament. We could have a lengthy discussion about why there is that misunderstanding, whether it is because of the prominence of American media in Canada, education or whatever the case may be, but in regard to the primacy of Parliament in Canadian law and society, the member Parliament is the pinnacle of what this institution is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420016">There are 338 of us. When constituents talk about things like western alienation, they ask how we can make a difference. My response is that I know I can make a difference because I occupy the same number of seats as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> does, and as does any one of my Conservative, Bloc, NDP and Green colleagues.

              <ParaText id="6420050">The government was well advised to create a cross-party and, more importantly, joint parliamentary committee, which had both senators and members of Parliament as members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420051">I had the honour of sitting on that committee, at the request of my then leader, the Hon. Rosa Ambrose. I had the privilege of having very interesting and fascinating conversations with Canadians across the country who had different points of view. We came to a consensus in the form of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I want to be clear about the use of “consensus”, because the way democracy works, and this is a good thing, means that some people are in favour while others are against. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420052">Bill C-14 was passed in the House of Commons five years ago. This bill included a clause that could be considered a sunset clause, since it required that parliamentarians review the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420053">It was inevitable that this issue would end up before the courts, and it did. A Quebec Superior Court judge issued a decision in Truchon v. Attorney General of Canada on September 11, 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420054">Through the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, the federal government immediately reviewed the decision, decided to hold an online consultation and introduced a bill in the House of Commons in February. As we see it, that was the first major mistake. I have nothing against the judge or the Quebec Superior Court. Every court has its own responsibilities and makes its own decisions. The judge was appointed to that court in 2017, which was a good thing, and she was appointed to the Court of Appeal on November 20, which was a very good thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420055">Every aspect of this issue is sensitive. No matter which law we pass, there will be legal challenges. The better approach, the more responsible, respectful, reasonable approach, would have been for the government to appeal the ruling and then take it to the Supreme Court. As my colleague from Alberta quite rightly said earlier, the Constitution says that every province has a superior court and a court of appeal before cases reach the Supreme Court.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6420056">For that purpose, we need to have the highest degree of evaluation. In that specific case, the Superior Court of Quebec is good, but it is not enough. We need to be sure of our judgment on that. That is why the government should have appealed the decision and then let the Supreme Court judges decide what is good and right based on the law, based on our Constitution and based on our Canadian history that we are proud of. That is how it works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420057">However, that is not how it went. The government decided to call the shots right now. I heard my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>. He is always articulate and always passionate, but with all due respect, I do not agree with him. Just because we are appealing this decision to the appeal court and then the Supreme Court, that does not mean we pay no respect to the Superior Court of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6420058">It is simply a matter of respecting the judicial process as it is set out in our Constitution, particularly when it comes to an issue as sensitive as medical assistance in dying. Regardless of the law that is passed here, we can expect it to be challenged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420059">It would have been far better to draft legislation based on a Supreme Court decision, as we did five years ago, rather than on a Superior Court decision. I say that with all due respect for Justice Baudouin, who was just recently appointed to the appeal court by the Liberal minister, and for the Quebec Superior Court, which plays an important, essential and extremely serious role in our justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420060">A debate took place in the House of Commons. This was well before COVID-19, before the words “in-person meeting” became part of our everyday vocabulary and at a time when the word “zoom” referred to a camera lens and not to a way of holding meetings. In short, we have adopted a lot of new concepts in 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420061">Getting back to what I was saying, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> was introduced in the House of Commons on February 24 following the decision rendered on September 11, 2019, and the subsequent government consultations. On February 26 and 27, we began debate at second reading. We followed the usual regular, rigorous process. Discussions were held. Things were being done in a reasonable manner, even though it would have been preferable if this matter had been brought before the Supreme Court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420062">Then COVID-19 happened. The government did what it had to do, that is, it postponed the study of this bill and sought an extension from the court because of the delay. The court agreed. Parliament resumed in September, and that is when the government made a serious mistake. I will come back to that later.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420063">Now let's get to the substance of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. As I said earlier, there will not be unanimity on this bill because society is not unanimous. That is the very foundation of democracy. That is why we are here in the House of Commons. Some people are for, and some are against. Some people are right-leaning, and some are left-leaning. Some people are sovereignists, and some are federalists. Society is not a monolithic block. The beauty of society lies in all its different textures. That is the democracy that we must preserve. That is why we need to have intelligent debates in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420064">That is why, during the analysis, our party proposed two amendments that are entirely respectful and reasonable and that seek to protect the most vulnerable people in our society. The amendments essentially call for the 10-day reflection period to be restored when death is reasonably foreseeable, and for the 90-day reflection period to be increased to 120 days when death is not reasonably foreseeable. The purpose of those amendments is to ensure that individuals who choose to act have enough time to look into their hearts and make the decision that feels right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420065">That is why prestigious organizations have spoken out against Bill C-7. The Canadian Psychiatric Association has expressed very serious reservations. The Canadian Bar Association has said that it has conditional reservations about this bill. The Council of Canadians with Disabilities opposed the bill. Groups like Living with Dignity, a Quebec-based network, and Inclusion Canada have spoken out against the bill. Indigenous spiritual leaders have expressed very serious reservations. In short, society has spoken, and that is what makes for an interesting debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420066">We needed to have a proper debate, with people on both sides of the issue. That is why we would have liked the debate to run its course, without the very heavy influence of the deadline imposed by the Quebec Superior Court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420067">I will now talk about our work in Parliament, which is essential. I mentioned that Bill C-7 was introduced in February, before COVID-19 and the return of the House. However, the government decided to prorogue Parliament. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made this decision because he was not pleased with the work being done by our MPs on the parliamentary committees studying ethics and WE Charity. The more the work progressed, the more things were heating up for the Prime Minister. He therefore decided to prorogue Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420068">This prorogation put an end to all committee and House work, and the study of Bill C-7 had to start all over again. As a result, we lost 24 days of parliamentary time. Had we not had this prorogation, we would have resumed on September 21, not on September 23 with the throne speech. Furthermore, had we started on September 21, we would not have lost all the work that had already been done so far on the bill, which adds up to 24 additional sitting days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420069">The government has the power to prorogue Parliament. Even if I accept the prorogation, why did the government wait so long to introduce Bill C-7? Today we are being told that the Superior Court's December 18 deadline is fast approaching and that we need to hurry up so the Senate can pass the bill in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420070">The government presented its throne speech on September 23. When was Bill C-7 introduced? It could have been introduced on September 24, like Bill C-2 was. It could have been introduced on September 25, like Bill C-3, the bill on judges, was. However, this bill was introduced on October 5, costing us seven parliamentary sitting days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420071">Now, the government is lecturing us, claiming that the Conservatives will not stop talking for talking's sake and that we are wasting time. No. The government has full control over the agenda, and it is the one that decided to prorogue Parliament, wasting 24 days of parliamentary time. On top of the prorogation, this government wasted seven sitting days before introducing this bill, even though it knew full well that everything had to be finished by the Superior Court's December 18 deadline.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420072">Consequently, I will never accept responsibility for the fact that we are still not done, a week and a half out from the December 18 deadline set by the Quebec Superior Court. The government is entirely responsible for this situation, and I will never allow it to accuse us of causing delays. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420073">Not once have Conservative members acted petty, not at second reading, not in committee, not at report stage and not at third reading. Some members support this issue and others oppose it, but we have always expressed our opinions in an appropriate, respectful way.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6420074">We never used filibusters or any other rule to be sure that we would let it go, without any decision made. We were respectful, because this issue calls for being respectful. We did it correctly. I am very proud to be the House Leader of the Official Opposition, because members on this side of the House, the official opposition, did a tremendous job at each and every stage. Conservative members were very serious; they were very parliamentary; they did it correctly. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6420075">That is the opposite of what the Liberals did at the Standing Committee on Finance, where they engaged in systematic obstruction for over 16 hours to prevent the committee from studying ethics scandals, and at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, where the Liberals engaged in almost 40 hours of obstruction over the course of 10 meetings. That is what I call wasting time. We have done serious, diligent work here, and we are very proud of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420076">As I said, the government that is being held hostage by that date, December 18. If ever this bill were not passed by Canada's Parliament, including the Senate, by December 18, what would happen? Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> will continue to apply, and the Truchon ruling will apply in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420077">Basically, the regime proposed in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> would not apply, but life would go on, no pun intended. People will keep doing what needs to be done, as they have done from the start, except that the Truchon decision will apply in Quebec and Bill C-14 will apply in the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420078">I would like to talk about one final, but critical, issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420079">With regard to freedom of speech and freedom of vote, I am very proud to be the House Leader of the Conservative Party.

              <ParaText id="6420085">Everyone will recall that the Supreme Court of Canada had at the time unanimously ordered the Harper government to introduce the legislation that would become Bill C-14.

We had to ask for an extension, which was unprecedented. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420090">First, with regard to the question about 2015, as I said in my speech, we were on the verge of an election campaign. Medical assistance in dying is an issue that must be above partisanship, while an election campaign is the pinnacle of partisanship. That is normal because we are fighting for our ridings and our seats and some debates may become acrimonious because we are being guided by partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420091">Partisanship is not at all what is needed in the debate on medical assistance in dying.

              <ParaText id="6420109">My colleague raised first nations, saying the government is ready to take them to the Supreme Court. First nations leaders said that they are concerned about the bill, as did the Canadian Psychiatric Association. There is no link there with the Conservative Party of Canada. No, it is Canadian society who has these concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420110">More than that, as human beings, we can change our minds. A friend of mine, who was a strong supporter of the medical assistance in dying policy, changed his mind. Why? Because his father was suffering two years ago and he had to fight with him about it. He said that he was a strong supporter of assisted dying, but not anymore because he lived through it with his father. This is what he told me.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420112">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to again speak to the bill. There were a lot of things that I wanted to say the first time around at report stage that I could not share because we ran out of time, but hopefully I will be able to conclude my remarks today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420113">I am splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252999" Type="2">Northumberland—Peterborough South</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420114">The <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> spoke in the House earlier today and talked about how Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is moving our country from a regime of assisted death to a regime of assisted suicide. We presently have in place former Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which was brought in as a response to the Carter decision. That bill recognized the fact that the Supreme Court said that medically assisted death was a right but needed to be surrounded by guardrails, by safeguards that would ensure that the most vulnerable in Canada do not end up dying when they have an opportunity to live a productive life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420115">The Carter decision resulted in legislation that imposed a requirement that death needed to be reasonably foreseeable. The legislation before us eliminates that and a whole bunch of other safeguards that the original legislation was intended to keep in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420116">Why are we at this place in the first place? Members in the House know that a lower court from Quebec, one single judge, ruled in the Truchon case that the reasonable foreseeability aspect of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> violated the Charter of Rights. It was unconstitutional. This is a lower court from Quebec, one single judge, making a life and death decision for Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420117">One would expect, from a Liberal government that takes veterans to court and takes first nations to the Supreme Court of Canada, that this life and death decision would be appealed. The Truchon case would be appealed through to the Supreme Court so that we could have the Supreme Court, which articulated the Carter decision, comment on whether reasonable foreseeability was in fact constitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420118">Instead the Liberal government said, no, it was not going to appeal and in fact it would simply respond to the Truchon case and do exactly as that single judge of a lower court asked it to do. The Liberals eliminated reasonable foreseeability from Canada's medical assistance in dying regime. That is why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420119">Members may recall, when <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> first came forward, when the Carter decision had to be responded to, that parliamentarians noted the fact that this represented the crest of a steep, slippery slope toward making assisted suicide available to a broader and broader group of vulnerable Canadians. That was the concern that we expressed at the time and, quite frankly, some people mocked us. They said we were fearmongering. They pooh-poohed our concerns. Today, here we are and our concerns have been borne out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420120">Last time I did not get a chance to read into the record a letter from a doctor in my community of Abbotsford, Dr. James Warkentin, who expressed his concerns about the legislation. He says, “I appreciate your invitation to write to you regarding C-7. As a family physician, the decriminalization of medical assistance in dying in 2016 struck me at my core. How could killing someone one day cost me my licence and send me to jail, and the next day be expected of me to provide? Furthermore, how could our most vulnerable be protected from the pressure to end their life one day and then have state-sanctioned avenues the next?” He went on to reference the six reasons why over 1,000 Canadian physicians have signed a letter opposing Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420121">In a moment I am going to read that letter into the record, because I believe those judges would appreciate having that letter on the record so it is very clear that many medical professionals across the country oppose Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which would remove many of the safeguards, the guardrails, the protections for the vulnerable which were originally intended under the Carter decision.</ParaText>

The care and encouragement shown by physicians may be the most powerful force in overcoming despair and providing hope. Unfortunately, patients can no longer unconditionally trust their medical professional to advocate for their life when they are at their weakest and most vulnerable.

              <ParaText id="6420144">Madam Speaker, I have been a little disappointed at the tenor of the debate recently regarding MAID. I am hopeful we can carry this back to the passionate, but compassionate, debate we had earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420145">This is a matter of conscience and I am certainly very proud to be part of a party that has given me, as the member for Northumberland—Peterborough South, the freedom to decide how I would like to vote on this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420146">When we look at the legislation, after extensive consultation with folks inside and outside of my riding, a number of issues have occurred. The challenging part for me is that despite many advocates for persons with disabilities raising the alarm bells, much media attention on this and how they might feel, we really have not seen any amendments or changes to this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420147">I would say this earnestly and with openness for my friends across the aisle. Are we so arrogant that we believe this language is absolutely perfect and completely beyond improvement? The member for <Affiliation DbId="252780" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> used to say a number of times that there was always room to be better and there was always the opportunity to be better. In response to that, with all kindness and respect, this bill can be better and there are opportunities to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420148">Some legislation the government has put in during this last year alone has failed. The rent subsidy program did not go off as well as the government had hoped. All reasonable observers, and even members on the other side, would acknowledge that. That is why they had to relaunch the program. The LEEFF program is also not working up to capacity and no doubt will have to be redone. We have seen those challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420149">The difficulty with this legislation is that there is no ability to redo it. This is a life or death matter. If we lose members of our most vulnerable communities due to the legislation, we cannot come back. There is no redo of this. I am perfectly aware, as a lawyer, of the obligation the court has put in front of us from the Truchon decision to get this legislation revised. However, there are multiple devices, as our leader spoke about, to get that time extended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420150">In all respect and fairness, any reasonable, objective observer would say that it was the government that prorogued Parliament for an additional six weeks. We would have had the time to pass this on time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420151"> I will get into my remarks, but let us keep the tenor of this debate how it is meant to be and how our constituents want it to be. They want a deep discussion of the important issues of passion, the very reason our Parliament exists and the very reason this reasonable debate is what makes Canada, in my opinion, such a great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420152">To get into the substance of my speech, those who support Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> do not want anyone to suffer. Those who do not support it do not want anyone to suffer either. It is important to begin this controversial debate by recognizing that both sides, regardless of how different their beliefs are, are passionate for the right reasons. As with any legislation that will have a dramatic impact on people's lives, the discussion is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420153">Medical assistance in dying is a relatively new topic. Canada is one of the few countries that has legalized it so far, and as such, we much proceed in this new territory with the utmost caution. As our members have spoken about, we need the safeguards. This is not just the members of the Conservative Party mentioning this. Some of our most noted jurists in Canadian history have brought this up, jurists from all sides of the political spectrum who have called for and demanded that there be safeguards. As we say, and it is only common sense, this is a matter of life and death. While we should be guaranteeing a death with dignity, I strongly believe we should first guarantee a dignified end of life.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420154">In order to do this, in order to make sure that people are choosing medical assistance in dying for the right reason, I believe that we need to have a conversation around the state of palliative care in our country. Unfortunately, the state of palliative care in our country is less than favourable. While medical assistance in dying is currently considered an essential service, palliative care is not. This is an issue that should be gravely concerning to everyone in this House and across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420155">Palliative care is a type of health care for patients and families facing life-limiting illnesses. It helps patients to achieve the best possible quality of life right up to the end of one's life. I know, and I am sure that many members share this, I have had some of the most important conversations of my life with loved ones and friends at or near the end of their life. These moments provide so much quality to those who carry forward and provide so much advice that I carry forward with me to this very day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420156"> Where it is possible to retain a reasonable quality of life, we as a society have a sacrosanct obligation to make sure that people are taken care of, so that, if they do decide on medical assistance in dying, they have done so of their own free will and not because of a poor quality of life that could have been avoided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420157">Quality palliative care focuses on the concerns of patients and families, and works to support patients through both physical and mental symptoms of serious illness. This may include everything from helping to manage a patient's pain and symptoms to keeping them comfortable in their home for as long as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420158">Unfortunately, while 75% of Canadians would prefer to have their last moments at home, only about 15% have access to palliative home care and 60% die, instead of being surrounded in the homes that some of them have grown up in, in cold, stark hospitals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420159">Many physicians have raised the concern, because the majority of Canadians do not have access to high-quality palliative care. It is possible that many people, or at least some people, may be choosing MAID because they do not feel there are other options. Amongst the concerns are those laid out by Dr. Stephanie Kafie, a family physician in Niagara Falls with a focus on caring for the elderly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420160">She has said that something that has not been considered in the rush of passing this bill is the state of palliative care. It is not considered an essential service, however, MAID is. In her experience, many requests for MAID reflected a need for palliative care. Rushing misguided laws regarding the medical profession has led to an erosion of their profession and started significant damage to doctor-patient relations. Their hands are tied. They are not consulted on the drastic changes that are being made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420161">As Dr. Kafie notes, the importance of consulting with doctors in the creation of legislation is so crucial. As is so often is the case with parliamentarians, not enough people working on the legislation have any experience in the field itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420162"> Dr. Drijber, a palliative care physician, has spoken out on this issue, stating that this legislation seems to ignore the importance of the dignity that comes with palliative care, the importance of those final moments for both the living and those who will pass on. He has gone so far as to say that it seems the government has not fully consulted with experts or people who work in the field to help guide them through their decision-making process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420163">When we come to a conclusion here, in all earnesty and openness, I am reaching out to the other side. They know that there are people in their constituencies who will have differing opinions from them, as do I. We need to make sure that all voices are heard. Are we so arrogant as parliamentarians to think we should not change the legislation, that we cannot, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252780" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> has said, always do better?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420180">Here we are on December 8, 2020, only 10 days away from a deadline imposed on Parliament by the Quebec Superior Court from the Truchon decision. The Liberal side of the House is suggesting that perhaps it is the fault of members of the Conservative Party for delaying progress on this very important topic. I take exception to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420181">How did we come to this point in the first place? Our leader spoke this morning and he raised this topic, and so I am just going to repeat some of what he said. First of all, there was the failure of the current Attorney General to appeal this decision of the Quebec Superior Court. It is a lower court. In my opinion it was a wrong decision, and it should have been appealed, first of all, to the Quebec Court of Appeal. We would have had the benefit of the wisdom of that bench. Subsequently it should have been appealed, like all important constitutional issues, at the Supreme Court of Canada. I have the deepest respect for the Supreme Court of Canada and the constitutional expertise and scholarship that has come out of that court. The Attorney General has missed that opportunity to be able to engage the Supreme Court of Canada in the discussion on this very important topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420182">Parliament, as our leader said, is the top court of the land. We are sovereign. We can make and unmake any laws that we want, provided that they are within the four walls of the Constitution of this country. That is the dialogue that we should have had with the Supreme Court of Canada. That, sadly, will not be happening on this topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420183">The second very important point is prorogation. We had been making good progress on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. We were talking about this back in February and March already. Prorogation happened, and the debate had to go right back to square one. How is that our fault? Why did the Liberal government decide on prorogation? It was not for any good policy considerations. It was strictly for political considerations, so we are not going to wear that. The Liberal government is going to wear that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420184">Another point that I would like to raise is that if Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> reacted in the narrow way that the Truchon decision required, this debate would be much shorter and faster, but the government has decided to take the opportunity to expand the debate. The Liberals are suggesting that we are disrespecting the Truchon decision and the Quebec Superior Court by raising these issues. We are not the ones who are raising the additional issues; it is the government in its Bill C-7 that is doing so. If Bill C-7 was just about the Truchon decision, then it would not be talking about removing the 10-day reflection period. The “First Annual Report on Medical Assistance in Dying in Canada, 2019”, just recently published by Health Canada, has told us that, of the 7,336 MAID applications in 2019, 236 of the applicants changed their minds during the 10-day reflection period. Obviously, that 10-day reflection is there for a purpose. It is serving that purpose very well. Why would we be removing that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420185">Furthermore, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> has introduced the concept of advance directives and, consequently, the elimination of contemporaneous consent by the person who is asking for the medical assistance in dying. That would be shifting the final decision away from the person receiving medical assistance in dying to the person who would now be going to apply it. We are no further ahead. I do not think that is an improvement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420186">Then, there is the other requirement, removing the second witness. What is that about? Why is that so important? There are so many legal documents that require two witnesses, wills for example, to make sure that there is not coercion on the part of people who might benefit. In the case of wills, the beneficiaries of the will might benefit. It is a long-standing legal principle that two witnesses be required. These changes are significant, and disability groups across the country have told us so loudly and clearly.</ParaText>

That is why we are at an impasse in this eleventh hour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420188">Mr. Neil Belanger, executive director of the British Columbia Aboriginal Network on Disability Society, commented on a newly released document entitled “In Plain Sight”, commissioned by British Columbia's minister of health, the Hon.

This government has sadly treated as a settled constitutional principle that it is unconstitutional for any law of this country to refuse medical assistance in dying to those who meet all the other criteria, but are not dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420197">This is a fundamental shift that was not debated. This government has stated on many occasions that it had broad consultations and 300,000 people responded, but the one question it never asked was if people agreed that medical assistance in dying should be given to those whose death was not reasonably foreseeable. The fundamental question was never asked. That is not a true consultation, in my opinion. It is a pretext for advancing a legislative agenda that had been preconceived. It has been said on several occasions in the House during this debate that the current <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> voted against Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> four years ago because it did not address that, and did not expand MAID to that point.

Some argue we are seeking their best interests by expanding access to MAID, not only for the relief of suffering but also purely for the sake of free choice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420219">On the idea of choice, we have to remember this is not an ordinary decision. Someone's death, premature or otherwise, is literally a point of no return. The decision is final. With all the circumstances leading someone to consider the end of their life, it gets complicated very quickly.</ParaText>

But you also can’t truly conceive of the many subtle forces—invariably well meaning, kindhearted, even gentle, yet as persuasive as a tsunami—that emerge when your physical autonomy is hopelessly compromised.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6420223">Despite Mattlin's significant physical disability, he is a father, a husband, an author and a journalist. He has a successful life and he knows what he wants. He is less vulnerable than others who lack the confidence and spark he has, who could easily be persuaded that assisted suicide was their best option. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420224">The idea of this happening voluntarily is, in many subtle ways, the start of a slippery slope that leads to it happening less voluntarily, or involuntarily. The choice is not always so free, especially if real alternatives are lacking. One of the greatest fears a lot of people face in their lifetime is their own mortality, and in a lot of breadth that is what we are discussing here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420225">When I talk about Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, when I talk about facing our own mortality, I often reflect on the experiences my wife and I have had, when grandparents and other loved ones within our family have passed away. We have spent countless hours at their sides, either in the hospital or in their care home. The time spent with one's family is so precious and valuable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420226">Within the last year, the health of my wife's grandma deteriorated. Her husband had passed away a few years prior, and she had been living in, I think, level 1 care for most of COVID. We were not allowed to go into the facility and had to stand outside the building. She had a nice corner unit with lots of windows, so we were able to observe her condition and speak to her through the window.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420227">Over the course of time, we watched her state of mind and physical state deteriorate steadily and progressively. Her state degraded to the point that she could not lift her head when we came to the window to talk to her. She could not see who was there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420228">When the restrictions were lifted and one or two people were allowed into the unit, my wife was able to sit beside her grandma, hold her hand and tell her that she loved her. To see her state improve, and to be able to lift her spirits, was so powerful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420229">I think that as we are having this discussion on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, we especially need to ensure that we value life and that we are giving people every option to live their lives. We should also have the opportunity to have our loved ones at our sides as we go through the final moments and face the ultimate end of our mortality, the end of our life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420230">We need to make sure that people have full supports as well. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I note that one of the biggest parts of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is the need for palliative care. I have talked at length previously about the need for it to make sure we are providing real choice and real options to people so they have all the options they need and, quite frankly, deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420231">The vast majority of people who are being considered under Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, or who will consider MAID, are in our senior population. When we look at the contributions they have made to our society, these are the people who built our country. These are the people who have provided us with the freedoms and opportunities we have. However, here we are discussing a bill, which we will be voting on in the near future, that basically signals to them that we do not value their lives and do not value the contributions they have made to this country. That is what the bill signals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420232">I know people will argue that this is not what the bill is doing, but sometimes it is not about what the bill directly does, but what it is going to do indirectly. The moment we signify to our country, to our citizens, that we inherently do not value and defend life to its fullest extent, we are sending the wrong message to people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420233">I realize that people who advocate for Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and medical assistance in dying are doing it from a position of compassion.

              <ParaText id="6420271">At the local level, he served as a school trustee, city councillor and mayor. In 1980, Ron was first elected as the Liberal member of Parliament for Sault Ste. Marie and served as parliamentary secretary to then justice minister, Jean Chrétien. Ron was elected again for a second term in 1993 and served as the minister of Indian affairs and northern development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420272">Irwin was invested into the Order of Canada and was a recipient of the Queen's jubilee medal. I had the honour to present him with a Canada 150 pin for his exceptional public service career, spanning over 35 years. Ron served not only our community but our nation with strong conviction and persevering efforts. He served as Canada's ambassador to Ireland and as a consul general in Boston.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420273"> I was blessed to have Ron as a friend and a supporter. Nobody campaigned like Ron. Rest in peace, dear friend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420274"> Lisa and I offer our condolences to his wife Marg, his family and his so many friends. I thank him on behalf of all constituents of Sault Ste. Marie for his years of service.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420276">The ongoing frustrations of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with restrictions to work and school from home, have amplified their exasperation and demand for better service. Back in 2017, only 37% of rural households had access to the sufficient Internet speed identified by the federal government, compared with 97% of urban households. Now in 2020, as more people are working, studying and streaming at home, our already unreliable connections have worsened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420277">The Liberal government has repeatedly promised to improve Internet connectivity but has failed to deliver. This is a slap in the face to my constituents who pay more to get less and often buy additional equipment, like boosters, just to get five megabytes per second downloads, if they are lucky.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420278">Canada's Conservatives are demanding concrete action from the Liberal government to connect rural Canadians and eliminate these barriers to equal opportunity in today's digital economy and society.</ParaText>

This is basically why advocacy groups are saying that this legislation more or less amounts to assisted suicide. That is a message that we do not want to be portraying to Canadians, particularly as we look at many areas of the country that are under a suicide pandemic in its own right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420521">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252542" Type="2">Yorkton—Melville</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420522">Dr. Heidi Janz, the committee chair of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, expressed her alarm at the breakneck speed at which the finance committee was operating. She called on members of the committee to extend public consultations on the legislation. I agree with her. We are moving way too quickly on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420523">One of my constituents told me back in February that we need to slow this down. We also have to remember that we are here because of the WE scandal and the prorogation. That took away over a month of time we could have been debating this issue in the House. That has caused this to become a panic and there is a supposed rush to get this done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420524">I thought it important to repeat a few things. Sometimes Canadians, as they watch these debates, may get confused as we talk about things. I wanted to summarize a couple of quick points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420525">We are here because of the Truchon case from the Quebec Superior Court. This talks about the section in the current law that said death must be reasonably foreseeable. It struck it down and said it needed to be changed. That was the start of this particular bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420526">The government chose to not appeal that, which is unusual. Normally, when a lower court makes a ruling against a government bill, especially one that is significant, the government of the day appeals, in this case, to the Quebec Court of Appeal and ultimately the Supreme Court. The government, for whatever reason, decided not to appeal it. Because of that, this bill will now be open to those who are chronically ill and chronically disabled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420527">They specifically excluded people with mental illness as opposed to excluding, say, people who are paraplegics. To me, this is arbitrary: it is picking winners and losers, and it is certainly going to make this legislation, if it passes, open to a charter challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420528">I also want to mention safeguards that have been removed in this legislation, such as the 10-day reflection period. As one of my colleagues mentioned this morning, since the MAID legislation has been in place, 263 Canadians who chose to pursue MAID changed their minds within the 10-day reflection period and did not pursue it. That is 263 Canadian lives that were saved because of the 10-day reflection period. That reflection period is gone, and future Canadians who might make that choice will not be saved if this goes through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420529">Another safeguard that has been removed is final consent. One can now give advance consent for this procedure. This is a problem for me, because we do not know, when the time comes, if the person wants to go through with this procedure because consent is not required anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420530">The other thing is that the current legislation requires two witnesses to agree that this makes sense for the individual. That is now down to one witness. There is no need for witnesses to agree. Just one person has to say it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420531">I also want to mention the new 90-day waiting period safeguard that has been added for those for whom death is not reasonably foreseeable. I do not think that 90 days is long enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420532">For example, if someone has a spinal cord injury, that injury may not even have begun to recover within 90 days. In Ontario, if someone needs access to specialized long-term care, it takes on average 126 days to get it. If someone needs a specialized pain clinic, the median time to get that is five and a half months. Even something as simple as applying for a CPP disability benefit takes 120 days. All of those are far longer than 90 days. In my opinion, 90 days is too short for a waiting period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420533">The disability community has been very vocal since this has come out. I want to mention a few quotes. The first is from Inclusion Canada. It said, “By providing MAID beyond end of life circumstances to Canadians with disabilities, Canada would signal that these Canadians are expendable and threaten their lives, dignity and belonging.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420534">Canadian Physicians for Life stated, “This Bill prejudices marginalized patients to the incidental effects of a regime that endorses death as an appropriate response to non-life-threatening illness and disability. Furthermore, this Bill not only creates an unavoidable risk that some individuals could actually be euthanized against their true wishes, it increases that risk by removing key safeguards that ensure such requests are valid in the first place.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420535">The Christian Legal Fellowship said, “The risks created by this Bill—risks that will have a devastating impact on marginalized Canadians—are grossly disproportionate to the benefits it attempts to confer on those seeking more expedient access to MAID.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420536">The Catholic Bishops of Canada “remain steadfastly opposed to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>”.</ParaText>

If indigenous advocates believe that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was a step in the wrong direction, why is the government taking things even further with Bill C-7? What is the purpose of rushing this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420577">I also remember the elements of the Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> debate pertaining to instances of MAID abuse in other parts of the world. This is key. The Belgian model, which Bill C-14 was modelled after, is known for its abuse. In Belgium and the Netherlands, MAID laws, once limited to mentally competent, terminally ill adults, now include adults and children with mental deficiencies, severely disabled individuals and even those with treatable psychiatric conditions, such as anorexia and depression. Between 2012 and 2017, the Netherlands alone saw a 600% increase in euthanasia, which was sought to address psychiatric conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420578">When was the government planning to take a hard look at Canada's MAID regime and how we could prevent this kind of abuse in the future? The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> says that it is in the works and part of the plan. Why was it not done first? This is the cart before the horse. It is the tail wagging the dog.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420579">By ignoring a five-year review, the government has also cast aside the concerns of physicians. We cannot ignore the monumental importance medical professionals place on their Hippocratic oath, such is true of Dr. Ramona Coelho, a champion of conscience rights in her field. She told former MP David Anderson at the end of the Parliament, “Doctors know the importance of conscience rights to protect themselves and their patients...people like me who are being pressured to leave family medicine. I know palliative care doctors in Ontario who have stopped practising. I know nurses in institutions who are feeling bullied…shift their focus, or retire early ...The pressure is there, and we are looking for relief.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420580"> It saddens me that the government has yet to establish conscience protections for medical practitioners who do not wish to violate their conscience while at a patient's beside. This bill is asking doctors to go far beyond what Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> even asked them to do. In Dr. Coelho's words, “it is my conscience that pushes me to go the extra mile, and I think patient care will suffer if doctors are not allowed to live with integrity and follow their conscience.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420581">It is because of this risk of abuse on many fronts that many of us on this side of the House walked away from the Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> debate with an unpleasant feeling in our gut, one that suggested that the implementation of the MAID regime had started Canada down a very slippery slope to a culture of death on demand. We are at Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420582">However, there was an ever-present light at the end of the tunnel with Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. The five-year review was important to members of the House and indeed to all Canadians. It is shameful we find ourselves ramming through this legislation before this review is even started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420583">On that note, I realize that the Liberals are frustrated that my colleagues and I have been so diligent in vocalizing the outpouring of concern from disabled Canadians, concerned medical professionals and those whose personal beliefs conflict with the bill. That is our responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420584">The Liberals desperately want to speed up the passage of this life and death legislation. They want to meet the deadline imposed by the Quebec Superior Court, a deadline they could have met comfortably if the House had sat in May and June and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had not prorogued Parliament in August.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420585">In a way, this is beside the point. The December 18 deadline is arbitrary, as was the deadline for Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. As legislators, our mandate is to pass the best legislation possible for all Canadians. I underscore the words “all Canadians”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420586">The bill has barely been studied as the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights only held four meetings of hearings. Many witnesses and briefs were denied a voice because of this. Of course, the Liberals certainly could have, should have and still could appeal the Quebec Superior Court decision. We could have struck a balance in good faith of what Canadians actually wanted when it came to end-of-life decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420587">As I said in a previous debate, four years since the passage of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> has allowed Canadians to further process the idea of assisted death. Almost 80% of Canadians believe it should be easier to make end-of-life decisions for themselves. That number is seven points higher than it was four years ago upon the passage of Bill C-14.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420588">At the same time, Canadians are unwavering in their support of strong safeguards for the most vulnerable in our society as well as conscience protections for medical professionals. They are unwavering. According to an Angus Reid Institute poll released last month, the same majority of Canadians who desire empowerment in their end-of-life decisions want Parliament to weigh the risks of MAID for those living with mental health issues such as depression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420589">Sixty-nine per cent of Canadians fear depressed individuals could see MAID as a means to escape dealing with the underlying cause of their condition. Of those surveyed, 65% want Parliament and the courts to consider MAID's impact on the elderly and those with disabilities. They fear death-on-demand could encourage these Canadians to seek it as a means of ending their perceived burden on others. This perceived feeling is being encouraged and more research needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420590">Sixty-two per cent of Canadians want Parliament and the courts to examine the potential impact of MAID on our health care system. There is a danger that increased reliance on assisted death will lead policy-makers to begin neglecting long-term and palliative care. I am being gracious in saying “begin”, because, in my view, we can see this discouraging trend unfolding already.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420591">Seventy per cent of Canadians continue to live without access to palliative care, while the government has failed to invest the $3 billion it promised to help in closing that gap. Clearly there is a discrepancy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420592">Canadians are equally as outspoken when it comes to conscience protection for doctors or those whose faith bars their participation in MAID. Fifty-seven per cent agree that nursing homes and hospices with conscientious objections should be able to deny MAID to those who request it. The Canadian Medical Association has indicated that 23,000 doctors are available to provide this service, which is more than enough across Canada. We need to protect our conscience protections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420593">Canadians want to see reasonable safeguards maintained in Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. They want to see Parliament legislate with their interests in mind, their interests, not those of the courts. They want to see the House continue to give credence to the views of medical professionals and those with disabilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420594">Regrettably, judging by what we have seen through debate, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> is another example of the government allowing the courts to legislate for Canadians. This bill is not reflective of what Canadians hold dear: Care and compassion for all, regardless of age, disabilities or religious beliefs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420595">Public health and economic safeguards have been the highest priority of the House throughout the pandemic. That is why so many in this place and across the country find Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>'s attack on end-of-life safeguards so painfully ironic and troubling. It is for this reason I cannot and will not support the bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6420612">Madam Speaker, I am rising today to participate in the third reading debate of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. I want to recognize the very real and legitimate challenge here and the difficult questions that were raised by the Truchon decision, which declared that the reasonably foreseeable death criterion for accessing medical assistance in dying goes against the charter and is null and void. When we talk about the deadline in December that we are working toward, we are talking about the moment when the court decision will take effect and the criterion, regardless of whether Bill C-7 passes, will take effect. At that point, reasonable foreseeability of death will no longer be a condition for accessing medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420613">That raises a lot of difficult questions. It raises a lot of questions about the nature of human dignity. Of course, one thing to consider in the long-standing debate on medical assistance in dying is the dignity provided to people who are experiencing severe suffering and know that it is not going to get better. There is a sense of autonomy that comes from being able to choose their own time to go and the conditions under which they go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420614">There is another really important side to human dignity, and we have heard some other members speak to it already today. It is the dignity of those who choose life and want to choose life. They have to know that in so doing they have the resources and the respect for their human rights to make that affirmation of life and to choose to go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420615">I want to take some time to recognize that, for people in the disability community in Canada, this debate comes in a very difficult context. It comes in the context of decades of neglect and inadequate resourcing and support, and a recognition of the barriers they face in trying to live a full life and realize their potential. It comes in the context of the pandemic, during which there have been conversations about how to allocate scarce resources and a real worry, on the part of people living with disabilities, that decision-makers might not value their lives in the way they value the lives of others, which has to be scary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420616">When they looked for reassurance that the government had their backs and understood these concerns, what they saw over the first number of months of the pandemic, about six or seven months, was a lot of heel-dragging on a commitment to make a simple one-time payment to support people with disabilities regarding the added costs and difficulties of the pandemic. I can understand why that does not engender a lot of confidence that the government has their backs and understands their real concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420617">In light of the Truchon decision, the long-standing neglect of people living with disabilities and the heightened sense of urgency given the pandemic, I can definitely understand how this has become such a charged issue and understand the very strong feelings that people, especially in the disability community, are facing. They do not want to be faced with the terrible dilemma of having to choose between a life of poverty and suffering on the one hand and a premature death on the other hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420618">There are certainly members in the House speaking today to one side of that dilemma, which is wanting to ensure that people are not forced into a premature death. However, I put it to the House that we cannot do that if we are not willing to address the other side of the dilemma, which is to recognize the overwhelming number of people in Canada living with disabilities who are forced into a life of poverty. There are a number of people living with disabilities who have managed to overcome a whole bunch of barriers to get gainful employment and support themselves and their families, and that is a wonderful thing. That is what I wish for all people living with disabilities for whom that is a possibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420619">However, we also have to recognize that many people with disabilities are not going to have a full-time job just like everybody else. There are barriers that simply will not permit that. That is why we see such a high number of people living with disabilities on various kinds of social assistance plans and other kinds of income support programs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420620">Those programs have been totally inadequate for allowing the people who depend on them for their income to live with dignity. When we talk about dignity, it is really important that we talk about this, human rights and the importance of recognizing that people living with disabilities have rights and deserve to live in dignity. It takes resources to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420621">I really want to take the time to put the emphasis on that side, because the court has made a decision about whether a reasonably foreseeable death can be part of the criteria for medical assistance in dying. The government chose not to appeal it. I cannot change the government's decision on that. The NDP cannot change the government's decision on that. However, what we can do is try to add to and take on the sense of urgency the government has had in getting this legislation through the House when the House has been sitting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420622">I take the point. There is some real legitimacy to the point that, as we all know, we could have had more time in the House to consider these questions. When members talk about the effect of prorogation on House time, they are quite right about it. We have seen some urgency from the government regarding the legislation, but we need to see that same urgency for putting the supports in place for people living with disabilities so that the overwhelming majority of people living with disabilities are not forced, by virtue of being on some kind of income support plan, to live a life of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420623">That is why I was proud, as the NDP's disability inclusion critic, to write, alongside the member for <Affiliation DbId="253064" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation>, the government last week, calling for it to institute one national disability income support program that would cover people who are already receiving income support under the auspices of a disability program, whether it is through the provinces, the territories or the federal government. We want to set that at a rate of $2,200 a month to recognize that $2,000 a month is a reasonable standard, which many in the country recognized during the pandemic. It is not easy for everyone, for sure, but it is a reasonable standard of income. We have seen a larger consensus than ever on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420624"> We also need to recognize, as we did when the Canada emergency student benefit was established, that people living with disabilities do face additional costs. There was a differential for students living with disabilities. They were paid a little more in recognition of those additional costs. I think that $2,200 a month would accomplish that and would make sure that no matter where people in Canada, they have some kind of basic income that would allow them to put a roof over their head and get the basic necessities of life. Valuing life cannot just mean “not death”. It has to mean providing the resources for people to really live a life they value and that they feel allows them to meet their full potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420625">That is not just a question of income. It is also a question of getting very deliberate and focused about an employment strategy to change the attitude of many employers who do not have experience with people living with disabilities. We can educate them about what they can do in the workplace to make it more friendly to people living with disabilities. It will help overcome some of those barriers and change attitudes in society generally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420626">It is also about supports, like investments in good public housing where rent is geared to income, so those who are not high-income people can still afford to be in good housing. It is about investing in good transportation options so that people living with disabilities who are not able to own or operate their own vehicle still have good options to get around the city. This helps with employment, but it also helps with socializing in times when we are able to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420627">If we want to talk about the value of life, these are things we not only have to talk about, but have to do. We have to do them with the same sense of urgency that the government has put on passing this legislation. I am very much looking forward to doing things in that urgent way, and the NDP will continue to push for this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420631"> People bring their faith to the debate. That does not mean everyone is going to agree. We know that not everyone in the Christian community, for example, agrees on this point. There are people of faith who are proponents of medical assistance in dying, just as there are people of faith who are opponents of medical assistance in dying, and there is just about every position in between.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420632">The important thing is to stay focused on the issue at hand and not to get into ad hominem arguments. I know there is often a temptation for that in politics, but particularly for issues like this, it is important to avoid that temptation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420637">We need to do that when it comes to palliative care. We also need to do it when it comes to things like pharmacare and dental care.

We need to create supports for people living with disabilities that will allow those who want to choose life to have a life in which they can flourish and live with dignity.

              <ParaText id="6420650"> What we do know from the government is that it had a vague commitment in the Speech from the Throne to a bold new disability income support program. We are trying to fill in the blanks. Oftentimes, we see the current government, on other issues, make promises without a lot of details. Characteristically, New Democrats are interested in the details and how we would get it done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420651">That is why we proposed a number, we proposed a way to do it and we proposed what the advantages of doing that would be in terms of making sure that it does not depend on what part of the country people live in or what their level of income support is as a person living with disabilities. It is a way to put money back in the hands of provinces at a time when they desperately need it, and it is a way now to make sure that if they do need income support as a person living with disabilities, they are not forced below the poverty line. If we look at the rates that are paid across the provinces and by the federal government, it is not enough to make it. It is just not enough and that has to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420652">When we talk about valuing life, about people choosing life and about not forcing them into a dilemma between premature death on the one hand and poverty and suffering on the other, it has to mean an income that does not keep them below the poverty line. That absolutely has to change and that is the real crux of that proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420653">We are hoping that the government will see that proposal as a good way to implement its own promise. If the Liberals have another idea, they had better hurry up and share it because this needs to be addressed with the same sense of urgency as this bill has been pushed through the House.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6420654">Madam Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to rise yet again to oppose this deeply flawed and dangerous legislation, Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. The Liberals have been complaining in the media that they think the Conservatives are holding up the legislation and that they are going to miss their court-imposed deadline of December 18, but they really have no one but themselves to blame. Conservatives are doing our constitutionally mandated job to hold the Liberal government accountable on its legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420655">Looking at the record over these past eight months, it is clear that my party has bent over backwards to give the Liberals the breathing room to implement emergency economic aid and other COVID-related measures. We have been very co-operative. We have also seen a great deal of government legislation move fairly quickly through the House just this fall, and in a minority Parliament at that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420656">Let us look at the Liberal record on moving the legislation forward. From the very beginning, the government really made its own bed on this one when it refused to defend its own legislation, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which was just passed in the last Parliament. Even some of its own members said on Twitter that the legislation was unconstitutional, admitting they felt it was unconstitutional even when they were voting for it, but they did not use the opportunity to appeal the legislation to the Supreme Court. That shows me that it was the government's intent to use the courts to circumvent Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420657">Parliament was mandated, under Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, to conduct a thorough review of medical assistance in dying and that review was to occur next year. It is important to have these sorts of reviews built into legislation because when we talk about something as serious as medical assistance in dying, which is a novel legislation, a new innovation in our social fabric, Canadian people really have not had adequate time to digest how they feel about the legislation and to examine their lived experiences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420658">A five-year review was a very adequate provision to give Canadians a bit of time to assess the bill and then have Parliament make recommendations and possibly changes to the legislation so that we could fix the bill, whether that meant tightening up some things that were prone to abuse or maybe loosening up the legislation in cases where it was needed. However, with the Liberal government's desire to short-circuit the legislative process and the will of the previous Parliament, it chose to fast-track the legislation by not choosing to appeal it to the Supreme Court. I believe this was done very purposely to ensure the legislation would pass before a review took place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420659">If the review had gone forward, as we have seen from the Council of Canadian Academies, there are a lot of questions about the practice of the legislation and how it has been carried out over the past few years. Abuses have been raised in committee and in the House repeatedly, yet in the legislation the government has taken no efforts to take those experiences and make this a safer piece of legislation for vulnerable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420660">Going to the next example of why the government's problem is one it made itself, with the COVID-19 pandemic, which I agree was not the government's fault, it was required to request several extensions of the bill. The courts were willing to approve those extensions and, in late summer, Liberals chose to prorogue Parliament. By proroguing Parliament, they made the choice to clear the decks of all of their legislation, start from the beginning and send us back to the drawing board. By doing that, they delayed the legislation further. For the Liberal government to claim that Conservatives are holding up the bill when what we are doing is our constitutionally mandated job, especially on an issue as important as life and death, it does not ring true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420661">Another example is that if the bill was so important for the government to get passed so quickly, why was it not the first justice bill it put forward? Bill <Document DbId="10867694" Type="3">C-3</Document> was passed in a very expeditious manner with all parties' support in the House. It was passed, largely, with the support of committee and minimal amendments. Even in that expedited manner, that delayed the government's legislation by weeks. The Liberals are talking and complaining about how Conservatives are allegedly delaying the legislation, but it was their own choices that resulted in the delay of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420662">We are left today with the government complaining that the Conservatives are doing their job. We are doing our job by criticizing the Liberals' legislation. We are holding them to account. We are championing the rights of vulnerable people. We will never apologize for doing what our constituents have sent us here to do, which is to stand up for their deeply held beliefs, to stand up for their concerns and to stand up for vulnerable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420663">Vulnerable Canadians made their desires known and their concerns known very loudly and clearly at the committee. I am pleased to see that the other place has had more time to hear from witnesses. I believe it has heard from over 80 witnesses, the vast majority of whom are opposed to the legislation. Frankly, in the House, we only had four committee meetings for this very important legislation, so I am pleased that the Senate is taking its responsibility seriously and thoroughly examining the bill and hearing from vulnerable people and others who are concerned about the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420664">The members of these communities were afraid of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. They were assured by the government that they would be protected and that there were protections for people with mental illnesses from accessing it. There were protections for children. There was the reasonably foreseeable death requirement, which was touted as a great protection for the disabled community. I can tell members that what they are saying is that they are terrified by what they see in this bill from the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420665">I read today on CBC that the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> appears to be in a showdown with disabled groups who are demanding a halt to the bill. The idea that the Minister of Justice, whose role is to uphold the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for Canadians, is fighting and ignoring the pleas of disabled and other vulnerable Canadians is just plain wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420666">Conservatives have been listening and we have been fighting for these vulnerable Canadians. It appears that nobody else is willing to fight for them. That is what we will do. We are fighting for these vulnerable Canadians. We are not being intransigent about this bill. Conservatives have a wide range of perspectives on this issue. We have put forward, as a party, some very common-sense amendments that do not undermine the legality of medical assistance in dying as a general practice but will do a lot to assuage the fears of vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420667">Some of these common-sense amendments proposed at committee included protecting patients from undue coercion. By coercion, people immediately draw up images of doctors in deeply immoral situations pushing medical assistance in dying on vulnerable people who are isolated from loved ones and family members. I am not trying to say that is happening. Frankly, I think what we have seen is that it is a lot more benign than that. It is not doctors aggressively pushing medical assistance in dying on people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420668">Someone may be in a situation where there is a power imbalance, and as a disabled person, other vulnerable person or a person who is older, they might not have family members or access to supports like social workers and psychologists. In this situation, they trust their doctors and that is a good thing because our doctors work very hard and they are very professional. However, if someone has that trust relationship with their doctor and the doctor comes and asks if they have considered medical assistance in dying, that could seem very benign for an average person. If I was in a situation like that and the doctor came to me, I would say no thanks, but we never know what someone else is going through and what challenges they are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420669">If they do not have someone to turn to, they can feel like the doctor is looking out for their best interests and the doctor is suggesting that they consider medical assistance in dying, so maybe the doctor is right and maybe that person should consider it. In this case, we recognize there is a power imbalance. At committee, we suggested putting forward some very strong protections to say that health care professionals should in no way be presenting medical assistance in dying as an option to patients. This is a basic protection.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420670">This is something we talked about with the last bill. I was actually very disturbed, during debate at second reading, when a Liberal member stood up and talked about a couple they knew who had not ever considered medical assistance in dying. It was a very touching story. The member nonchalantly said that the doctor came in, passed them a brochure and asked if they had ever considered medical assistance in dying. The member, I think, thought that this was an innocuous and benign situation, but for me and for people in disabled and vulnerable communities, it was very scary that they could be put into this situation without adequate supports. They might feel like they were being coerced into a decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420671">We also wanted to put in some stronger protections around a period of reflection. I think the period of reflection is key because, even in the government's own reports on medical assistance in dying, there were many cases in which people did not receive disability supports, and they received MAID while still not receiving disability supports. There were people waiting to get palliative care who had not received access to palliative care who also received medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420672">It clearly illustrates that the government is not putting the resources in to help disabled Canadians, or to help Canadians who need palliative care. If we shorten the timeline or eliminate the timeline altogether, we are really losing an opportunity for people to access these wonderful services that can make the end of life much more peaceful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420673">One of the sad things about debating this bill today is that I feel like I am being forced to defend the status quo, implemented in the last Parliament under Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I was not a big fan of Bill C-14, and as legislation it has proven time and again to fail to protect vulnerable people. It certainly did not protect the prisoners who underwent medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420674"> This issue was raised by the Office of the Correctional Investigator, and it has deep moral and ethical problems. Prisoners really have no power. He raised a case in which a prisoner was coming close to the end of life and wanted to die peacefully in the community with access to palliative care. They were denied the opportunity to do so, and then chose MAID instead. I think the correctional investigator was very astute in bringing that up. In situations where somebody does not have a right to determine their own manner of death or the manner that leads up to their death, how can they be given a choice to access medical assistance in dying? That raises some big issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420675">In numerous cases, people were largely not sick with anything. In one case in the Globe and Mail a number of years ago, an elderly couple in their nineties wanted to die together. According to the article, they were not suffering from any pre-existing conditions, except arthritis, but it was ruled that because they were so old their deaths were reasonably foreseeable. That is really troubling. Medical professionals have raised the point that a reasonably foreseeable death is not actually defined in any medical journal. There is no definition of “reasonably foreseeable.” It is so subjective. One thing that I would have liked to see with this legislation was for the government to come forward with an actual medical definition of “reasonably foreseeable.” Instead, it has chosen to eliminate this language altogether, which waters down the protections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420676"> Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> did not save people who were suffering from mental illness from receiving medical assistance in dying. There was a case in Chilliwack where somebody who had a history of depression was able to access medical assistance in dying in an expedited manner. Their family was not informed until very late into the process and they were not able to intervene and explain that this person, while they did have a reasonably foreseeable condition, also suffered from depression and other challenges and that maybe, with a social worker or a psychologist, those things could have been worked out and medical assistance in dying could have been avoided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420677"> It is clear to me that we are removing even the barest of protections. We are removing this adequate reflection period and making this legislation, which is already prone to abuses, even more open with this new legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420678">The government claims this new bill is safe because it is explicitly denying people who are suffering exclusively from a mental illness from receiving MAID. When the previous legislation was brought in, even though I was not a member of the House at the time, I sat in on a lot of meetings. It is interesting that, in committee appearances and at the joint special committee, Dr. Sonu Gaind from the Canadian Psychiatric Association was very hesitant to endorse medical assistance in dying for people suffering from mental illnesses, especially exclusively mental illnesses. Their testimony said that they do not treat any mental illness as if it is untreatable. There is always a treatment. Sometimes it is a very difficult treatment or an ongoing treatment, but society must never accept that there is not a way to treat mental illness. The alternative is that we stop helping people and that they seek medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420679">It is tricky when the government talks about excluding MAID for people with exclusively mental illness, but we are seeing that too many people who might qualify for medical assistance in dying because they have a physical condition and a reasonably foreseeable death also have a mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420680">Where doctors are involved, they are very well educated but they are not necessarily educated in all aspects of health. Not every doctor is a psychologist or qualified to make mental illness determinations. How do we know that somebody who might have a reasonably foreseeable death, and who might have a previous condition, is not depressed and seeking medical assistance in dying for the purpose of their mental illness?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420681">Under this legislation, there is no protection for those people seeking medical assistance in dying. While the government may say they qualify because they have a grievous and irremediable condition, we need to have more protections to ensure that people with mental illnesses are not seeking medical assistance in dying in the heat of the moment. Maybe they have had an incident that has led them to want it, and given more time to reflect maybe they could be dissuaded from seeking it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420682">There are no mechanisms, as I said. I am not going to just criticize, I am going to put forward actual, concrete ways I think we could make this legislation better. Unfortunately, it does not seem the government is in the mood to accept too many amendments from the Conservative side, but I will go ahead and say them anyway. We should require social workers and psychologists to be involved with decisions where underlying mental health issues, or issues related to access to income supports or to poverty, might be identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420683">I was very disturbed to read in Maclean's magazine that some people are seeking medical assistance in dying because they are living in poverty. That was never written in the legislation. That was never intended as a purpose for medical assistance in dying. By including these important medical professionals, we could make it much more difficult for people to get medical assistance in dying who might not make that decision if it was between them and a doctor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420684">That leads me to one of my final points. The government is removing some of the witness requirements. Under the previous legislation, an independent witness who was apart from the medical process was required to be involved. That would provide accountability to ensure that doctors and health care professionals were crossing all their t's and dotting all their i's to make sure that this was a completely kosher procedure. By removing the independent witness requirement, it is leaving the decision up to a doctor and the patient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420685">I am going to be opposing this legislation. I look forward to the other place coming back with some very strong amendments. I look forward to debating those amendments again, and getting the best possible legislation that will protect vulnerable people in this country.</ParaText>

I will say that I am unreservedly in support of better economic supports for the disabled and those who are in poverty, but it is really about how we reach that place. We live in a confederation. We have provinces that have their own income support measures. I know the NDP members were talking about a national measure. It is all about finding the best politically workable solution to ensure that people can get access to the income supports they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420690">Something that has been alluded to is that statistics are showing a lot of people who are accessing medical assistance in dying are in the upper class, but people who are impoverished are accessing this because they have concerns about their ability to make their payments or to live life the way they want to. We need to address those intersectional socio-economic factors with this legislation, and I do not think that has been given adequate coverage.</ParaText>

She had several severe disabilities. At the time, I was in the newsroom at CTV Saskatoon, and we did several stories with the Latimer family, almost every week.

              <ParaText id="6420695">Madam Speaker, it was a shocking case, and it laid bare some very difficult questions. In my perspective, when we are talking about this legislation, that it is one of the strong reasons there was so much all-party support to prevent minors from accessing medical assistance in dying. I think it is absolutely critical that we ensure that remains the policy in this country: that minors not be allowed to access medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420696">I think it also raises questions about how we value human beings. My younger sister, who has passed, had Down syndrome. We live in a much more inclusive society today, and I think that is a wonderful thing, but we have seen how people can devalue the lives of people like my younger sister, and we need to ensure that we stand up for the value of those people's lives. I think that is what we, as a Conservative caucus, are trying to do when we are fighting for vulnerable people who we believe will be impacted, in some cases fatally, by this legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420711">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in the House again this afternoon and speak to a bill that I believe deserves long and serious consideration. The ramifications of this bill will last a very long time, beyond any one Parliament or group of parliamentarians. Hence, it would be behoove this Parliament to make sure that we spend adequate time reflecting on this bill and making sure we get it right. As I have said before, and I believe it bears repeating, especially as we debate this bill, the character of a nation is reflected in how it treats its most vulnerable citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420712">There is an ancient writing from the Book of Psalms that many members would be familiar with. It has been utilized all over the world and has been heard for centuries and generations. Psalm 23 simply states, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for [you are] with me”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420713">In one of my previous roles, as a minister, I had the privilege of walking with individuals and families as they traversed that valley of the shadow of death. I have both witnessed and experienced personally what it means to be affected by the passing of a loved one, as I am sure many, if not all, in this chamber have as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420714">This bill brings with it great responsibility. It literally deals with matters pertaining to life and death, and decisions of absolute and complete finality. I believe it would behoove this House to take adequate time to reflect upon the powerful testimonies we have heard at committee. Testimonies such as Mr. Roger Foley's, which shares his story of being denied the health services he requested and being pressured, instead, to pursue a medically assisted death. He is now fighting for others to not be put in the same situation he was, and he supports our amendments to the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420715">Krista Carr also gave testimony at committee. She is from Inclusion Canada and works with persons with disabilities. She stated at committee that the worst fears of those living with disabilities are being realized by Bill<Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. The government's own <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> has stated that MAID should not be brought up by doctors to the disabled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420716">Indigenous leaders, including the former attorney general and minister of justice for Canada, have also raised serious concerns over this bill and its inadequate safeguards. Medical practitioners have raised concerns pertaining to conscience rights as they pertain to medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420717">In light of all these concerns that have been brought to the table, and all of these powerful testimonies that we have been able to hear, we can see that Canadians from across the country are raising the alarm bells and encouraging us parliamentarians to get this right because of the finality that this decision entails.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420718">What would be wrong for us to pause and adequately reflect about such serious matters, and take the time to ensure that adequate safeguards are built in so that the concerns of the most vulnerable people among us are adequately addressed? No one could deny that those concerns have not been expressed with fervency and urgency. At this point, we as parliamentarians should take the time to reflect and ask, what steps are we taking to make sure those concerns are being addressed in this legislation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420719">In my time as a pastor, I got to know a lady who was suffering greatly with a disease that had caused her to become incapacitated, in many ways. She could not walk. She could not even lift her arms to feed herself as the disease progressed. Her health was deteriorating. Her emotional stability was already ravaged by having gone through the loss of her husband overseas. </ParaText>

It was almost a pablum-based type of nourishment because she was slowly losing her ability to chew food. Her circumstances were overwhelming. While visiting and being in the hospital with her and her mom at this time, we could not leave without being affected by what we saw. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420721">I must say that our local, faith and church communities responded and did everything they could to provide encouragement, visits and make sure adequate food and support was provided where possible. She had been through so much she even had a hard time expressing everything she was going through. I remember one day when it did not appear she had all that long to be with us, I went to visit her in the hospital and witnessed her taking the nourishment from her mom. I remember leaving the hospital room shaken and wishing there was a better way for this lady. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420722">I am glad to report to members that she had an amazing turnaround. Her story did not end where we thought it was going to end. Though her pathway up to that point had been marked with a lot of suffering, discomfort and terrible loss, I am glad to say that over 12 years later this woman has fully recovered, is married again, enjoying life and doing well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420723"> One would ask what that has to do with what we are talking about. It has a whole lot to do with it. I believe there are many other Canadians who have walked through that valley of the shadow of death who wondered if their life was still worth living and if they could make it to the other side. Because of the supports, care and love from the friends, family and community members who stood by them in that most difficult of circumstances, they were able to get through that valley and get to the other side. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420724">How many other Canadians in terrible circumstances at the moment, who are feeling overwhelmed by what they are facing, would benefit from having people walk with them through that valley? It may be all they need to get to the other side. It may not be the case for everyone, but I know it was for that lady. I am so glad it was the case for her. It made all the difference in the world to know that others kept believing when she had lost the ability to believe herself. Now, after getting to the other side, she serves as an inspiration for many others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420725">I want to conclude with this. Though the valley of the shadow of death casts a very long and dark shadow for those going through it and for their families, as a member here who has lost a loved one, I can attest that we have an obligation as parliamentarians to pause and ensure that every safeguard is in place, so that when people are walking through that valley, they do not make a decision while still in the darkness, when they are near the end of that valley. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420726">The last part of the writing I shared earlier is “for [you are] with me”. I think the questions every parliamentarian needs to ask themselves are these: Are we going to be there for all Canadians who are in the midst of the valley of the shadow of death? Are we going to be with them by ensuring every safeguard is in place and the supports necessary to carry on are amply supplied?</ParaText>

I was wondering, having regard for the case of Roger Foley, if the member could provide his thoughts on the removal of a key safeguard in this bill, which is to provide for two independent witnesses. This legislation would remove that and provide that persons attending to the care of someone requesting medical assistance in dying can constitute a witness. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420737">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise once again to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, the government's medical assistance in dying legislation. I do acknowledge that this is an incredibly complex subject matter for which there are many diverse views.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420738">With that said, the way in which the government and the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> have handled the legislation is a lesson in what not to do, having regard for the gravity of the legislation. I say that having full respect for the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General</Affiliation>. I believe he is a sincere and intelligent individual who is compassionate and does want to do what he believes to be right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420739">That said, when the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> spoke in the House at second reading, he indicated that there were widespread consultations and that out of those consultations there was a consensus. Neither is true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420740">The consultations that the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> spoke about were largely over the course of one month in January of this year. They were online consultations that excluded vulnerable segments of the population, including persons with mobility, cognitive or visual impairments, persons without access to the Internet and persons living in remote and northern communities. Their voices were not heard or were not heard as easily as a result of the online consultation process that started and ended within roughly a period of one month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420741">Not only that, but the consultations were said to have had a predetermined outcome. In other words, the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> had an idea of the legislation that he sought to craft and he used the process as a way of getting the answers that he had hoped to receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420742">Do not take my word for that. Take the words of the persons who were involved in the consultation process, including Heidi Janz of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, or Dr. Catherine Frazee, the former chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission and a leading advocate for persons with disabilities. They said that the consultations were predetermined when they appeared before the justice committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420743">What about the consensus that supposedly arose out of these so-called extensive consultations that simply were not so? We know that out of those consultations just about every national disability rights organization opposes this bill. As we speak, they are calling on the <Affiliation DbId="253705" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> and the government to put this bill on pause. We know that more than 1,100 physicians have penned a letter expressing their opposition. Concerns were expressed by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420744">Just about every witness, if not every witness other than the minister himself, who appeared before the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee that held hearings the last couple of weeks, panned the bill. No one, it seems, is happy with the bill. So much for the minister's assertion at second reading in the House that there was a consensus. There was no consensus, because there was no meaningful consultation, and there was a predetermined result that has resulted in legislation that just about everyone in one way, shape or form has been highly critical of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420745">I heard over the course of the debate members of the government and other parties talk about this issue in a context as if there were no risks, “Get out of the way, let the patients make their choice and throw out safeguards, because otherwise one is infringing on individual autonomy.” The Supreme Court of Canada recognized in Carter that “there are risks, to be sure”, at paragraph 105 of the Carter decision, and the court talked about how those risks can be “'very substantially minimized through a carefully-designed system' that imposes strict limits that are scrupulously monitored and enforced”. That is what the Supreme Court of Canada said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420746">When we talk about those risks, one need look no further than the case of Roger Foley, who is severely disabled, requires 24-hour care and is in a hospital facility in London, Ontario. I will read what he said about his experience, because it really is quite shocking. When he came before the justice committee, he talked about what can happen when there are insufficient safeguards, and we are talking about safeguards that are in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> which are now being further removed by Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>.

He said, “All of them talked about the role of the state in protecting the decisionally vulnerable, as they were called, people who could be pushed into end-of-life treatment because they felt they were a burden. This has been talked about since the 1990s, and this Attorney General is removing the safeguards from our regime. Every ounce of case law on the issue of assisted dying, euthanasia or assisted suicide talks about protecting those vulnerable.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420781">Speaking of protecting the vulnerable, the leader also said, “All major disability groups in Canada agree with the compassionate and reasonable position being presented by my Conservative colleagues. I am very proud of the advocacy we have shown. We have also been joined by legal scholars, indigenous leaders and people working with people with mental health issues.” I wholeheartedly echo the comments made by my hon. friend this morning and repeat the need for the government to step back from its repealing of the provisions that would ensure a 10-day waiting period, as well as two witnesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420782">As a matter of fact, regarding the 10-day waiting period, a senior employee of the AFN shared on Twitter recently, “This ten day period literally saved a member of family’s life. MAID must be accessible but also account for clear and thoughtful consent. The Liberals should rethink this.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420783">In closing, I want to completely acknowledge that both sides of this debate are coming from a point of view of compassion. I understand that the government has approached the drafting of the legislation in good faith, but the reality is that it has fallen short of its duty to Canadians. That is why I will be voting against this dangerous bill and I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider their support for it as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420785">As the bill went through committee, there were some challenges. I know some reasonable amendments were put forward by the Conservative caucus. I am wondering if the member could speak to those reasonable amendments and just how important they are to determining this piece of legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420786">Madam Speaker, I agree that some reasonable amendments were proposed, and we would like to see the 10-day reflection period I talked about put back. I would like to share a really personal story about this, which I think will emphasize that point to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420787">Back in 2014, in my small city in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, a young lady graduated from high school, a tremendous athlete. She had just finished her nursing degree, and I think one Tuesday night she was in a terrible car accident and ended up a paraplegic. This was a family friend of mine, and I had the privilege, or maybe the horror, of being in the hospital with her family that night and in the following days. I can guarantee the House that this young lady would have chosen death over life at that point if she had had that opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420788">Now this young lady, several years later, is a Paralympic athlete. She has gotten back to doing incredible things with her life. She has been all over the world for athletics. I could talk for a long time about this, but I am going to say something that came from her dad. He said, “One of the really cool things we are slowly catching is the members of this special group of people don’t see themselves constrained in any way.” People with disabilities do not see this when they get past the hurdle of the original burden, which, in this case, was this young lady's accident.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420791">I want to share one other quick comment here. In the debate on this in the last Parliament, the former attorney general and justice minister commented about preventing the normalization of suicide to protect vulnerable person who are disproportionately at risk of inducement to suicide. She spoke of that repeatedly. This is from a CTV article:</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6420794">Madam Speaker, I feel honoured tonight to be speaking to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> given the many great speeches by my Conservative colleagues, who are concerned about our citizens and especially those in the disability and senior communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420795">I speak today deeply concerned about Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and the changes being proposed in the legislation. I know this is an emotional issue for everyone, and it is an important discussion we are having this evening. Any legislation that is introduced in Parliament requires a thorough review, but this is especially true for bills that are literally matters of life and death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420796">It is my firm belief that the federal government should have appealed to the Supreme Court to get certainty on the framework within which Parliament can legislate. Unfortunately, that did not happen, so here we are with a rushed bill that puts the lives of our most vulnerable at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420797">Make no mistake: As a Christian I am firmly against the use of medically assisted dying. That said, I understand that the courts have made a ruling and the legislation is required. However, we must ensure that this type of legislation includes safeguards for the most vulnerable in our society and for the conscience rights of physicians and health professionals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420798">That is why we Conservatives introduced a number of reasonable amendments to reinstate protections that the Liberal government has simply removed, which is troubling. These include reinstating a 10-day reflection period when death is reasonably foreseeable, extending the reflection period when death is not reasonably foreseeable, protecting vulnerable patients by requiring that the patient be the one who first requests information on medical assistance in dying and protecting the conscience rights of health care professionals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420799">It is unfortunate that these amendments have been rejected by the government. I am deeply concerned that this legislation will allow assisted death for Canadians who are not dying by removing the requirement that a person's death must be reasonably foreseeable for them to be eligible for assisted suicide and euthanasia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420800">My dad is 86 and my mom is 76, and as the son of two elderly Canadians, I am very concerned about what this would mean for our nation's seniors and the positions they may be put in when trying to access health care. Will they be placed in a position where they will have to decide between care and ending their lives because of outside pressure? As the bill expands medically assisted dying further, there is a risk that palliative care will suffer and, as a result, patients will view medically assisted dying as a better option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420801">I know Canadians share my concerns. It must be said that every national disability organization in Canada opposes this legislation. Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said at committee, “Bill C-7 is our worst nightmare.” These organizations caution that removing the end of life requirement discriminates against those who are disabled and puts their lives at even greater risk. Ms. Carr notes:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420802">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The end-of-life requirement was the only safeguard whereby disability was not the sole criterion. By having a disability itself under Bill C-7 as the justification for the termination of life, the very essence of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms would be shattered. Discrimination on the basis of disability would once again be entrenched in Canadian law.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420803">It is shameful that in the Liberal government's rush to pass the bill before Christmas, it continues to neglect to address legitimate concerns being raised by persons with disabilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420804">I am also deeply concerned about the limited protections for the conscience rights of our medical professionals. While some doctors and health care workers may have been comfortable with medically assisted dying under Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the continued expansion may cause them to rethink their participation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420805">Others who have always been against medically assisted dying are already feeling the pressure to go against what they believe. As the Physicians Alliance Against Euthanasia said in a news release just last March, “The pressure has been intense for many physicians, especially amongst palliative specialists, some leaving their profession even before this latest development. Descriptions were made of toxic practice environments and fear of discipline by medical regulators.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420806">Members of the justice committee have heard first-hand from disability advocates vehemently opposed to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and its rapid expansion of medical assistance in dying. They argue it amounts to a deadly form of discrimination, making it easier for persons with disabilities to die than live. It is shameful.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420807">Health care professionals have also spoken out, concerned not only about their conscience rights but also about the speed at which the government is trying to pass Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>. To quote Adam Taylor about the lack of consultation on this legislation, “As an emergency and family doctor, I know the importance of consultation, along with the day to day experiences and sufferings of Canadians which cannot be ignored. I'm terrifically concerned about this.” Even so, here we are, and the Liberals are continuing to push through the bill, ignoring concerns of those who would be directly affected by these changes. Again, it is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420808">As the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada said in its submission to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, we must carefully consider the impact of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and the concerns being raised by many Canadians, particularly Canadians with disabilities. The legislation, not to mention the human lives the bill would negatively affect, is too important to be rushed.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420812"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House to speak to my motion, Motion No. 36, which would have the House formerly recognize August 1 as emancipation day and in turn maintain our government's commitment to highlight the contributions people of African descent have made to Canadian society and continue to combat anti-Black racism today. This motion builds on the incredible work done by Senator Wanda Thomas Bernard with Bill S-255 in the last session of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420813">Motion No. 36 on emancipation day, when passed, would have Parliament officially recognize the abolition of slavery on August 1, 1834, in the British empire, including British North America, what we know as present day Canada; the role of British colonies, including our nation, in participating in the transatlantic slave trade and the abolitionists who laid the ground work for change and defied the norms of the time; the history of emancipation day, including the many untold stories and unsung achievements of Black Canadians in Canadian society; and address anti-Black racism in the context of the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent and for the purpose of achieving our goal of a just, inclusive and equal society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420814">In 1807, the British Parliament voted to end the transatlantic slave trade. On August 1, 1834, chattel slavery was abolished across the British empire and all its commonwealth territories, including Canada. This was a landmark victory for Black communities across the British empire and especially for the Black Canadians who organized, rallied and fought for this legislation. The day was one of celebration among Black Canadians who expressed their joy at being able to live freely and independently, though it also stood as an important occasion to reflect on the struggle it took to achieve that freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420815">Emancipation day allows for Canadians of African and Caribbean descent to connect through shared experiences and gives an opportunity to pass on the stories of their enslaved ancestors, whose names and experiences would otherwise not be recounted or honoured in any history book of that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420816">World recognition of emancipation day is at the heart of this motion and one of the primary pillars in education and awareness that should be highlighted. This summer, in the weeks leading up to emancipation day, I had the opportunity to consult with various advocacy groups regarding this motion. I want to highlight an emancipation day panel I attended with notable Black scholars in Canada, including the Hon. Jean Augustine, the first female Black Canadian member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420817">One of the key highlights I took from this event was the importance of education. The primary purpose of this motion is to continue to educate our community on Canada's history and culture as well as shed light on part of our history that we have not always acknowledged. It also presents us with a unique opportunity to learn about important Canadian Black historical figures, community leaders and trailblazers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420818">The history of emancipation day goes beyond the abolition of the slave trade. It should highlight the work of numerous Black scholars, activists and change-makers. We specifically want to acknowledge historic events like the underground railroad, where tens of thousands of African Canadians and African Americans bravely escaped slavery in the south and sought refuge in Canada from 1850 to 1860. We want to recognize the influential Black Canadian abolitionists and cultural leaders like Mary Ann Shadd, the first female newspaper publisher in Canada and first Black female publisher in North America.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420819">Ms. Shad founded and ran The Provincial Freeman from 1853 to 1860 and was a fierce anti-slavery activist. She used her platform to showcase Black culture and explored political and human rights issues, such as abolition, women's rights and the right to vote. She later went on to establish a non-segregated school in the town of Windsor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420820">I should recognize Viola Desmond, a Nova Scotia businesswoman who was arrested in 1946 for sitting in the whites-only section of a theatre. She was later charged with tax fraud. This incident became a catalyst for change as she refused to succumb to the racist policies of her time. Her case sparked a civil rights movement in Nova Scotia and inspired a generation of Black Nova Scotians and Canadians to fight for justice and human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420821">We must also acknowledge the Black Canadians who played a pivotal role in Canada's effort during World War I. Despite facing discrimination and barriers to enter into the armed forces, a significant group of Black men dedicated themselves to the war effort and served in multiple combat and support roles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420822"> For example, we should honour the No. 2 Construction Battalion, an all-Black military unit that dug trenches, diffused land mines, stocked ammunition and removed wounded soldiers from the battlefield. The contribution of the No. 2 Battalion was not recognized until much later in the war. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420823">In the words of Senator Bernard, “Emancipation Day served as an instrument to pass on the history and the memory of those who went before them and as a beacon for taking up the responsibility to carry on from where their ancestors left off.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420824">Since immigrating to Canada, I have been lucky to live in many diverse and multicultural ridings like Richmond Hill. However, I have seen and experienced the effects of racism, prejudice and discrimination in my daily life. I know that I can never know the struggle of Black Canadians in our society today, but it is our duty as allies to emphasize and to continue to educate ourselves on issues that continue to impact Black communities across the world and in our country of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420825">Throughout the month of July, my office created a social media campaign entitled “We Recognize”. This online campaign highlighted the stories of Black Canadians throughout history who have made important contributions to our society; Canadians whose stories were not told in our history books or in our school classrooms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420826"> My hope is that this motion will be the first step in acknowledging the gaps in our education system. It can encourage a greater focus on Black history and the inclusion of Black Canadian stories in history and social studies classes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420827">Emancipation day is a time for all Canadians to look inward and unlearn the biases and behaviours associated with the history of slavery that have resulted in the under-representation of Black Canadians in history books, school curriculums, elected positions and public service. It also serves as an opportunity for us to dismantle the remnants of institutionalized racism, discrimination and the overrepresentation of Black Canadians in correctional facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420828"> Recognizing emancipation day gives Canadians the opportunity to confront this reality and to advocate for greater diversity, inclusion and opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420829">I want to acknowledge the support that this motion has received from my colleague, Senator Wanda Thomas Bernard. Senator Bernard's guidance has been essential in allowing me to approach this motion with the care and nuance it required. Senator Bernard has been advocating extensively for this cause and continues to be a fierce advocate for Black communities across our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420832">In honour of emancipation day and the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent, I am calling on all Canadians to come together to confront our nation's history with racism as well as emancipation, so we can achieve better outcomes and representation for people who are marginalized, a label which disproportionately includes Black Canadians as well as first nations, Métis and Inuit people.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6420850">Mr. Speaker, I am going to start my remarks a little differently. I am going to try to tell a bit of a story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420851">Let us picture ourselves as my seven-year-old daughter and living in the southern United States in the 1830s. Life is not good. We utilize what was then known as the Underground Railway and make our way up. It is not a simple journey where people just grab a ticket, hop on the train and off they go. It is done at night. It is done, quite frequently, by foot. People need to use code words and travel constantly in fear that they may be recaptured and put back into slavery. Eventually, though, we make it to the Canadian border, or Upper Canada as it was known then, and cross that border. We feel that inspiration of hope. We know we are somewhere safer but we do not stop quite yet. We keep on going and travel to the most northern terminal of the Underground Railway, the village as Sydenham, now known as Owen Sound which, I am proud to say, is in my riding of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420852"> The only reason my daughter has to make that escape is because she happens to be of colour. It is sad, but I am glad that Canada has such a rich history and my riding has such a rich history in abolishing slavery. That Underground Railway helped free 30,000 to 40,000 slaves during its time of operation. It offered that beacon of hope. It gave people of Black descent an opportunity to settle, raise their families and find work. Again, it makes me so proud to come from the riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420853"> I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="253142" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation> for bringing forward this motion, Motion No. 36, and continue not what Senator Bernard started but actually what the Hon. Deepak Obhrai brought forward in this House in 1999, 21 years ago, as a private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="9597" Type="4">C-282</Document>. It was then brought forward within the Senate, a couple of years ago by the good senator. She tried to get it passed, but unfortunately the bill was not passed before Parliament broke. Fortunately, the member for Richmond Hill has brought it forward. I agree with his earlier comments; I am confident this motion will pass with unanimous consent in the House, when we get there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420854">My riding has some unique contributions that people of Black or African descent have made to this great country. This speaks to the motion as well. In the southernmost part of my riding, I have the town of Priceville. I did not know until I was preparing for this speech that it is named after Colonel Price. Colonel Price happened to be of Black descent, something I did not know. It just speaks again to the rich contributions Black people have made to Canada, throughout our history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420855">As well, in my own riding going back to 1993 to 2004, a former MP was Ovid Jackson. Ovid Jackson made national news at the time because while I come from a riding that is not as ethnically diverse as some of our ridings in more urban centres, Ovid was elected as a Black man. That speaks not only to the constituents of my great riding and how fair and balanced they are, but to what a nice, intelligent and competent individual Ovid himself was. Unfortunately, in my view, he ran for the wrong party, but we will deal with that on another day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420856">What is unique too about my riding and specifically Owen Sound, or the village of Sydenham as it was known then, is the Owen Sound Emancipation Festival. It is the longest ongoing festival in North America. It started in 1862, five years before Canada was officially a country, when Owen Sound or the village of Sydenham was recognizing the importance of the British Commonwealth's Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, which took effect August 1, 1834. The festival started back then with a picnic with the early settlers and they have been celebrating it non-stop ever since. That act freed more than 800,000 slaves across the British colonies and that festival kept going. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420857">In 2004, there was a commemorative cairn, and I challenge any members of Parliament if they are ever up in my riding to come and visit it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420858">It is in Harrison Park, right in the downtown part of Owen Sound, and it is a beautiful cairn that allows people of all backgrounds to go and visit, meditate for a while, think about the importance and the contributions Black people have made to our country, and remember the challenges they faced in our history. It recognizes those early settlers to my area: the Millers, the Johnsons, the Scotts, the Greens and the Courtneys. Their descendants come back. They are not just in the area, they actually come back from all across our great country, and, I dare say, across the world, every year to be part of that annual celebration, which has actually turned into a three-day event.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420859">I have a unique connection to Blaine Courtney, who is a past chair of the Owen Sound Emancipation Festival. He was actually my track and field coach as a young teenager. Blaine and I got along great. He never stopped pushing me all the time to be the best that I could be, and I actually think I owe him, and all my coaches, a lot of gratitude for making me into the person I am today. I think they were instrumental in helping me be successful in my military career, and hopefully it will lead to success here in my political career.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420860">Just a year and a half ago at the 2019 festival, my daughter and I were in attendance, and I was so proud as she was selected by the town crier to be part of the festival. She got to ring the bell, and she actually rang the bell with the granddaughters of Senator Bernard, and it was a unique experience. The one thing that I guess I was a little envious of was that my daughter made the front page of the local paper, the Owen Sound Sun Times, which is the biggest paper in my riding. I had just been elected as the Conservative candidate just a couple months prior, and there was my daughter making the front page of the newspaper and I was not mentioned at all. Maybe she has a future in politics if she wants. This year, of course, was slightly different; 2020 was done virtually, but I dare say it was impressive to see everybody still gathered and be instrumental as part of that festival.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420861">A key part, as well, in our riding is the Grey Roots Museum. That museum is a wealth of knowledge to educate people, which this motion speaks to the importance of. I really think that the root advantage of bringing this motion forward is to make sure we never forget, and at the same time that we educate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420862">I have travelled the world in my military career. I have been in countries all over the world, some of the worst parts of the world. I have always said that I have yet to meet a single person in any other nation around the world who, at that grassroots level, is any different from the average Canadian. Most people just want to live in peace and have their children grow up healthy, well-fed and with an opportunity to have more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420863">I have served with people of all descents and backgrounds. The best friend I made at basic training out in Chilliwack, unfortunately I can't remember his last name, was Derek. He and I were sort of like two peas in a pod. He was from Montreal. We did basic training together in Chilliwack and sort of tried to stay out of trouble. Unfortunately, he did not make it through basic training, and I have not seen him since. I got to the Royal Military College, and made friends like Scott Morrow and Austin Douglas. I served with Austin in The Royal Canadian Regiment as well. There was Master Corporal Raymond Farmer, who I will never forget. I do not know where Raymond is now, but he was sort of like my close protection bodyguard on my first tour in Afghanistan. All these gentlemen are people of Black descent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420864">I cannot imagine living in any country in the world other than Canada. We are so fortunate, and I am so glad that we played such an instrumental part in helping slaves escape from the United States back in the 1800s. I am so glad to see this motion being brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253142" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation>. It is a way to recognize the contributions the people of African descent have made to this great country. It is a way to educate and to recognize what they are still contributing to this day. This is the Canada I want my daughter to grow up and be proud of.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6420865">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking my hon. colleague for his speech and the friendship that is clear to all of us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420866">I am going to talk about Motion No. 36 to designate emancipation day. My colleague talked about education, so I am going to take this opportunity to revisit history, because knowing where we come from is the best way to know where we are going. Let me share a few historical facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420867">According to the <I>Canadian Encyclopedia</I>, the abolition of slavery in the British Empire began with the Act for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British colonies for promoting the industry of manumitted slaves; and for compensating persons hitherto entitled to the service of such slaves, also known as the Slavery Abolition Act. The member mentioned it earlier. The act received royal assent on August 28, 1833, and took effect in August 1834. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420868">The act abolished slavery in most British colonies, freeing the 800,000 African slaves in the Caribbean, South Africa and Canada. However, in the eastern colonies of Lower Canada, now Quebec, in Nova Scotia and in New Brunswick, abolitionist efforts remained unsuccessful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420869"> In 1793, for instance, Pierre-Louis Panet introduced a bill to the National Assembly to abolish enslavement in Lower Canada, but the bill languished over several sessions and never came to a vote. Instead, individual legal challenges first raised in the late 1700s undermined the institution of enslavement in these areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420870">One important case arose in February 1798, when an enslaved woman named Charlotte was arrested in Montreal and refused to return to her mistress. She was brought before James Monk, a justice of the King’s Bench with abolitionist sympathies, who released her on a technicality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420871">According to British law, enslaved persons could be detained only in houses of corrections, not common jails. Since no houses of correction existed in Montreal, Charlotte could not be detained there. Charlotte and another enslaved woman named Judith were accordingly freed that winter. Justice Monk stated in his ruling that he would apply this interpretation of the law to subsequent cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420872"> New France was not free from slavery. Thanks to the trail-blazing, if dated, work of Marcel Trudel, we know a fair amount about slavery in Quebec. He listed a total of 4,185 slaves for a period ranging from the 17th century to 1834. Of that number, three-quarters were indigenous slaves. The slave trade took on different proportions. The proportion of indigenous slaves, the Panis, was greater than that of African slaves. In 1759—there are a lot of dates, but it is important to remember them—records listed 1,100 Black slaves in Canada toward the end of the Seven Years' War. That is terrible.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420873">Obviously, we cannot talk about slavery without talking about the young Marie-Josèphe-Angélique, who was born in 1710 and hanged in 1734. In their book <I>Elles ont fait l'Amérique</I>, anthropologists Serge Bouchard and Marie-Christine Lévesque helped make many people aware of Marie-Josèphe-Angélique's story, which is the first documented case of slave resistance in the history of Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420874">Obviously, in 2020, we recognize that slavery is an extremely unfair practice. Unfortunately that was not always the case over the course of history. It was not until the 19th century that slavery was slowly abolished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420875">Although the Bloc Québécois is in favour of this motion, it might have been a good idea to have the motion place more emphasis on the agency of slaves in the slavery abolition process. What does agency mean? It is the ability of historical actors, particularly those who were oppressed, to make their mark on the world, transform and influence it for the better, rather than simply being subject to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420876">In fact, the motion seems to give the British Parliament an all-powerful role in the abolition of slavery, as if it were a divine gift that British parliamentarians bestowed upon slaves in the four corners of the empire. The historical reality is much more complex. We need to remember the context in which slavery was abolished. The emancipation proclamation was only the culmination of a historic process that slaves were an integral part of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420877">Our version of history so far has credited liberal abolitionists alone with putting an end to this unjust system. However, in a fairly recent book called <I>Slave No More: Self-Liberation Before Abolitionism in the Americas</I>, Russian historian Aline Helg describes the slaves' own agency and how they were the architects of their own liberation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420878">She details, from the very beginning, how slaves in the Americas between 1492 and 1838 engaged in rebellions and emancipation strategies. How were these slaves agents of their own liberation? Through marronage, enfranchisement, military involvement and rebellion. This cannot be forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420879">This motion is also inspired by the International Decade for People of African Descent, the theme of which is “People of African descent: recognition, justice and development”. In recognizing this decade, the House of Commons will put itself at the forefront of the recognition, justice and development of people of African descent as a distinct group whose human rights must be promoted and protected. This needs to be made clear here, in the democratic institutions that belong to all citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420880">That is why this motion, which recognizes historical facts and builds on this international decade, highlights the contributions made by African descendants to Quebec's and Canada's societies and acknowledges Canada's history of slavery through a national day of commemoration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420881">The Bloc Québécois will obviously vote in favour of this motion. I want to take a moment to acknowledge our beloved mayor back in my riding of Laurentides—Labelle, who has been in office for 14 years. He is one of just two Black mayors in Quebec's history. I congratulate Michel Adrien for his 14 years—</ParaText>

He is lifting up the work of the always honourable senator Dr. Wanda Thomas Bernard, who would indeed rank among the most learned and exalted members of Canadians of African descent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420887">Like many Black and racialized Canadians, I am often asked the question, “Where are you from?” When I share with them that I am Canadian, the next question I am asked is, “But what about your parents?” I tell them I am Canadian, and they ask about my grandparents. I share with them that I am Canadian. My people go back here six generations. In the previous speaker's comments, he inadvertently gave me a shout-out when recognizing the founding families in the settlement that have become Owen Sound. Indeed, I am my ancestors' wildest dreams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420888">My earliest memories of family would come from our annual trip to Owen Sound to Harrison Park, which is shared by the hon. member from that riding. This would be an extended family picnic and a place where I would be rooted in the celebration of emancipation day. Yes, this commemorates the history that goes back to 1862, before the Confederation of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420889">I am here in the spirit of the Black Moses, Harriet Tubman, who in escaping the wretched and brutal conditions of slavery in the south, risked her life to follow the North Star, to follow the footpaths of the Underground Railroad searching for the promised land. She was an exceptional woman, with a military mind, and a leader of the likes any people would be proud to claim. Indeed, my people followed that North Star from what is likely Maryland today and travelled for days along those backwoods paths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420890">We have heard here today, and I want to go on the record to correct the record, the framing of slaves. It is true that as a young person I grew up in our education system, and I would have shared that I am the son of runaway slaves. Of course, that is false. The context is very problematic because they were not slaves, they were people who were enslaved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420891">These were a people who survived the transatlantic slave trade and who found themselves in one of the most wretched conditions of humanity, the deepest evil of the United States of America at that time in those settlements, yet they survived. They were the ones who risked everything in following those footpaths to get to freedom, and they are the ones who will teach us about emancipation today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420892">Our history books will teach us that we were given freedom. I will share, as taught by the Black Moses Harriet Tubman, her grave warnings. She said, “If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there's [someone] shouting after you, keep going. Do not ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420893">The history books hide a painful truth in our collective class. They are things that I had to find for myself. The member is quite right that we have to change our education system. There was a book by Daniel Hill Sr., from which I learned that I am actually the descendant of freedom seekers. I would be remiss if I did not mention that in the motion the historical truths of Canada laid out very clearly in that British Parliament abolished slavery in the British Empire on August 1, 1834.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6420894">It also acknowledges and recognizes that slavery existed in British North America prior to abolition in 1834, which is a clear acknowledgement of the British Crown's active participation and, indeed, profiteering from the human trafficking and enslavement of stolen African diaspora.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420895"> Where is the acknowledgement and, indeed, the solemn apology to all descendants of African slavery from the Liberal government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420896">We have heard before, in section (c) of the motion, about abolitionists and others who struggled, and I will share that it is true in that time that men of faith, people of faith, Quakers and others risked everything to give refuge to people seeking freedom. My people were the first refugees of these lands. It begs the question, “What are you willing to sacrifice in order that others may be free, free from discrimination, free from police brutality, free from the systemic barriers?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420897">The government is facing a class action lawsuit from the public sector today. We have to contextualize exactly what emancipation means. I think a lot about the refugees seeking safety at Roxham Road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420898"> When the Government of Canada announces the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent to highlight important contributions and to provide a platform for confronting anti-Black racism, this would be a perfect time for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to make clear that recognition and acknowledgement in the form of reparations for the displacement of historical Black settlements, from Africville to Hogan's Alley and every settlement in between.</ParaText>

For our Elders, whose fight we continue until we are free”, and I will add, for the future generations that continue the struggle for our collective liberation and our emancipation, for our children and our children's children, until we are free.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420900">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Motion No. 36, which seeks to designate August 1 of every year as emancipation day in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420901">Motion No. 36 acknowledges that the British Parliament abolished slavery in the British Empire as of August 1, 1834, and that slavery existed in British North America prior to its abolition. In fact, Olivier Le Jeune was recorded as the first enslaved African to live in New France in the 1600s. Olivier's birth name is not known as he was taken from Africa as a young child and eventually given the last name of the priest who purchased him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420902">The Slavery Abolition Act ended slavery in the British Empire on August 1, 1834, and thus also in Canada. However, the first colony in the British Empire to have anti-slavery legislation was Upper Canada, now Ontario. Unfortunately, the act against slavery of 1793 did not free a single slave. It was superseded by the Slavery Abolition Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420903">To better understand the anti-slavery legislation of 1793, we have to remember Chloe Cooley. Chloe was a young Black woman who was enslaved in Fort Erie in the late 1700s. Her owner forced her onto a boat across the Niagara River into the United States to sell her. This incident is believed to have led to the passage of the legislation of 1793 in Upper Canada that prevented enslaved people from being imported into the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420904">Although the Slavery Abolition Act stopped slavery in the British colonies, it did not end in the American southern states. Up to 40,000 African American slaves tried to escape from the American south to freedom in the northern states or to Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420905">The Underground Railroad appeared in this context. It was not a railroad at all, but a complex clandestine network of people, including Blacks, fellow enslaved persons, white and indigenous sympathizers, Quakers, Methodists, Baptists, farmers, Americans and Canadians alike, who organized safe houses that helped enslaved men, women and children in southern plantations reach freedom in the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420906">Between 1850 and 1860 alone, up to 20,000 slaves reached Upper Canada. It became the main terminus of the Underground Railroad. Black Canadians helped build strong communities and contributed to the development of the provinces where they settled. Some lived in all-Black settlements such as Elgin, Buxton, Queen's Bush and the Dawn settlement near Dresden, Ontario, as well as Birchtown and Africville in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420907">They cultivated the land, built homes and raised families. Black people established religious, educational, social and cultural institutions, political groups and community building organizations. Two newspapers were also founded: The Voice of the Fugitive by Mary and Henry Bibb and Mary Ann Shadd Cary's The Provincial Freeman, making Cary the first Black woman in North America to edit a newspaper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420908">Through the ages, Black Canadians encountered various forms of discrimination. They were often relegated to certain jobs and denied the right to live in certain places due to their race. Parents were forced to send their children to segregated schools that existed in parts of Ontario and Nova Scotia. This is what historians call “residential segregation”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420909">People of African descent have shaped Canada's heritage and identity since the arrival of Mathieu Da Costa, a navigator and interpreter whose presence in Canada dates back to the early 1600s. However, the vital role of people of African descent has not always been viewed as such.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420910">Inspired by these stories of courage and resilience, Black Canadians of a more recent past have made tremendous contributions to our society. Let me recall some notable figures such as Alberta's Violet King, Canada's first Black female lawyer; Gloria Baylis, who in 1965 won the first-ever case of employment-related racial discrimination in Canada and founded the Baylis Medical Company; Chatham, Ontario's Fergie Jenkins, one of the most talented pitchers to ever play in Major League Baseball, winning the Cy Young Award in 1971 and becoming the first Canadian inducted into the National Baseball National Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1991; and Édouard Anglade, the first Black and for several years the only Black officer on the police force in Montreal.</ParaText>

It was almost as if Black history was erased. All these years later, decades later, my 16-year-old daughter still does not have what I wanted. She does not see herself in the books that she studies.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>

              <ParaText id="6420913"> Mr. Speaker, what a pleasure it is to speak to this important motion that my friend and colleague has introduced in the House. I do not think I can compete with the eloquent speeches that have been given in the last hour, because they came from the heart and have very strong, passionate words, but I do have a few thoughts I would like to share. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420914">The New Democratic member referenced the generations. I believe he said eight generations is the extent of his family roots. This triggered something in my memory. Many years ago, probably about 20 to 25, I was at the Victoria Hotel. There was a Black lady standing beside me, and a Caucasian individual walked up between us. He posed her a question: “How long have you been in Canada for?” As much as he meant it to be an innocent comment, I suspect that if she had been of a Caucasian background, that question would never have been asked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420915">I do not believe we have done well regarding education and cross-cultural awareness. That is why I put to my good friend the importance of it. Education is critically important to advance, and it goes beyond our classrooms. We can talk about our workforces and how we can incorporate it into our communities. A number of years ago, the Manitoba Intercultural Council came up with a recommendation that said the way people should deal with issues like this is through cross-cultural education. I am not too sure if the council exists today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420916">I think there have been some very interesting stories over the years that Hollywood has amplified. I am very touched when I watch some of the videos that I have acquired. For example, I have a copy of the <I>Roots</I> series. To watch it sets off all sorts of emotions, but I am mostly angry because it is hard to imagine how society could treat people in such a fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420917">The way the character William Wilberforce was portrayed in the show <I>Amazing Grace</I>, which is about the abolishment of slavery, and the impact the British Commonwealth had are so significant to the debate we are having today. However, as my colleague who spoke just before me alluded to regarding her daughter, for young people who are in school today, this major, important aspect of Canadian heritage has been completely overlooked and is not getting the attention it deserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420918">I am very proud of the general attitudes that are brought forward from parliamentarians when we talk, for example, of our Black caucus and the extending of hands to try to get more involvement on the issue of systemic racism, which is in fact present. It is very real and it is tangible. It hurts a great deal of Canadians in all regions of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420919">The objective of this motion is very admirable and needs to be put into place. I suspect that when it does come time for others to contribute to the debate and for the ultimate vote on the motion, it will pass through the House, as I believe it is long overdue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420925"> She said: Mr. Speaker, “The land is our Mother, so when we lose value for the land...people lose value for the women.” Thus says Vanessa Gray of Aamjiwnaang first nation in Ontario, and I agree. It is also my firm belief that, like systemic racism, environmental racism is something that has been ignored for far too many years. The time has come for us to act to redress the problems of the past and make sure they do not continue. Surely it should be enshrined as a human right for all Canadians to have clean air, water and earth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420926">I first became aware of the issue of environmental racism five years ago when I first met Dr. Ingrid Waldron, a professor in the School of Nursing at Dalhousie University, at a coffee shop in Halifax near the provincial legislature where I worked as an MLA. At that time, Dr. Waldron explained what her research and data gathering was proving about the reality of environmental racism in Nova Scotia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420927">I suggested that creating a legislative bill to address the issue would be of help at that point in time in bringing it to public awareness and to the floor of government in Nova Scotia. Dr. Waldron and I worked together for several weeks on my very first private member's bill, Bill No. 111, the environmental racism prevention act, which I introduced in Province House in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420928">Later on, Dr. Waldron wrote a book entitled <I>There's Something in the Water</I>, which highlights environmental racism in Black and indigenous communities across Nova Scotia. She recently partnered with Nova Scotian actor Elliot Page to create the 2019 documentary based on that book.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420929">Upon my arrival in Ottawa as an MP a year ago, my first personal order of business was to introduce a similar bill, but this time as a national strategy, in order to address environmental racism across Canada. The scope of Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> is therefore broader and more comprehensive than my original provincial bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420930">Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> would collect data, including socio-economic circumstances, physical and mental effects of communities affected by environmental racism across this land. These effects are wide-ranging, from skin rashes and upset stomachs to more serious ailments, such as respiratory illness, including asthma; cardiovascular disease; reproductive morbidity, including preterm births and babies born with Down syndrome; as well as cancers that disproportionately impact women. There is evidence that many chronic diseases in indigenous communities, for instance, are not primarily due to genetics or internal factors, but instead, to external factors, such as what is in the air, in the water and in our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420931">I would like to personally thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> at this time for seconding Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>. I suggest this is an example of what Canadians truly want to see in their government, especially in these dangerous times, which is parliamentarians working together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420932">I would like to thank Dr. David Suzuki and the David Suzuki Foundation, the Blue Dot movement and The ENRICH Project for their endorsement for and support of this vital bill. I would also like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Ingrid Waldron for her passion, dedication, research and assiduous study, as well as for sharing her notes with me this evening, because environmental racism and its effects on racialized communities need to be heard by everybody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420933">As MP for Cumberland—Colchester, I would like to explain what environmental racism is. It refers to the disproportionate location and greater exposure of indigenous, Black and other racialized communities to polluting industries and other environmental hazards. These toxic burdens have been linked to high rates of cancer, as I have said, and other health problems in these communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420934">From the decision approximately 60 years ago to off-load pulp mill effluent into Pictou Landing first nation's once pristine boat harbour and toxic landfills and dumps placed in the African Nova Scotian communities of Shelburne, Lincolnville and Africville to mercury contamination in Grassy Narrows First Nation, petrochemical facilities in the chemical valley of Ontario and in British Columbia, the legacy of environmental racism can no longer be ignored.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420946">I would contend that indigenous and Black women have been building grassroots environmental and social justice movements for decades to challenge the legal, political and corporate agendas that sanction and enable environmental racism and other forms of colonial violence in their communities. Colonial gendered violence continues today and includes the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, the displacement of indigenous people from their lands by corporate resource-extraction projects, anti-Black and anti-indigenous police violence and other forms of state-sanctioned violence that make it difficult for indigenous and Black peoples and women to meet their basic needs with respect to employment, income, health care and other resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420947">Colonization and genocide are tied to the intersections of indigenous lands and bodies. Women experience violence because they are the ones who are responsible for taking care of the land and holding it for future generations. Therefore, gendered violence that harms women specifically, also harms nations which makes it easier to take possession of the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420948">For indigenous women specifically, production and reproduction, land and life, resistance and survival are all intimately connected. There is no separation. Therefore, the indigenous role in fighting against environmental racism by defending their land and territory and protecting their water are acts of resistance against gendered oppression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420949">What is environmental racism exactly? How do we define it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420950">Environmental racism is racial discrimination in the disproportionate location and greater exposure of indigenous and racialized communities to contamination and pollution from polluting industries and other environmentally hazardous activities, as I said, but also in the lack of political power these communities have for resisting the placement of industrial polluters in their communities; in the implementation of policies that sanction the harmful and, in many cases, life-threatening presence of poisons in these communities; in the disproportionate negative impacts of environmental policies that result in differential rates of clean up of environmental contaminants in these communities; and in the history of excluding indigenous and racialized communities from mainstream environmental groups, decision-making boards, commissions and regulatory bodies and in the feminist movement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420951">Regarding the health effects of environmental racism in Canada, the health risks associated with that include, as I have said, all of these various different types of serious illnesses. Studies provide evidence that health effects of environmental racism are both gendered and racialized and impact indigenous women in specific ways, most notably the impacts on reproductive health. One of the most significant ways that environmental racism impacts indigenous women specifically is through the detrimental health effects of toxic contaminants that include high levels of toxins in breast milk, placenta, placenta cord blood, blood serum and body fat as well as infertility, miscarriages, premature births, premature menopause, reproductive system cancers and an inability to produce healthy children due to compromised endocrine and immune systems while in utero.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420952">This bill, Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>, is important. Why is it important? It would play a significant role in addressing the legacy of environmental racism in Canada and ensure that these communities would have access to clean air and water, to which all Canadians have a right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420953">It would also help address environmental health inequities in indigenous and Black communities that are outcomes of these communities' proximity to environmental contamination and pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420954">It is up to those with power, and not the people impacted by environmental racism, to address the problem. Those who have the most influence and the strongest voices need to be part of the solution. It is important that all communities have the power to control their environment. Currently, indigenous, Black and other racialized communities, non-white communities, do not have that power. When they do not have a say in what happens in their communities, we all suffer.</ParaText>

A lot of things are provincial and municipal like dumps, waste sites, toxic landfills and things like that. As I started to look into it more, I started to notice that it is stretched right across Canada. In fact, there are many corporate polluters, which is part of the reason why many indigenous communities do not have clean drinking water today, why children have rashes and why they have all kinds of illnesses. That is why our government is now tasked with cleaning that up. I think it will stretch across all kinds of departments, but it lands at the department of environment to begin with—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420991">I happen to have a few local examples that directly reflect this problem. I will share them with the House to illustrate why I said in my introduction that I support the principle of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420992"> My first local example is Appleton Waste Services, a company that was paid by many Penticton and area residents to pick up and collect garbage and then transport it and dispose of it at the local landfill. The company did not pay its bills to the operator of the landfill, which was another local government, the Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen, or RDOS, as we call it in the region. Because the bills were unpaid, the RDOS had to suspend service to Appleton Waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420993">Unfortunately, this did not stop the company from continuing to pick up waste and charge their customers for it. Instead, it made a deal that ultimately resulted in 5,000 tonnes of waste being dumped on Penticton Indian Band lands. The arrangement was that this was going to be a transfer station before the waste was hauled off to somewhere else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420994">How did it end? Well, the company disappeared, but a massive pile of waste became a serious problem for members of the Penticton Indian Band to deal with, and it was not even their own waste. It came from the citizens of the city of Penticton.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6420998">This is the first example that, in my view, speaks to the challenge that is referred to in the bill. I will provide a second local example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6420999">Many will know the Okanagan region I come from is famous for its excellent wines, but many years ago, it was for fruit growing. As a result, there is a significant fruit industry infrastructure in many small communities, much of it aging. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421000">In Naramata, there was an old fruit-packing warehouse that was scheduled for demolition and removal.

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6421001">In that case, charges were laid against the parties involved under provincial environmental legislation. This case eventually made its way through the courts. The defendants argued that these activities took place on the Penticton Indian Reserve, which does not come under provincial jurisdiction on such environmental matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421002">They argued that they had complied with all the requirements of the local government, in this case the Penticton Indian Band.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421003">In the end, an application was made challenging the charges on constitutional grounds. The judge ended up handing down a not guilty verdict and declaring that the application was moot, as there would be no further legal proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421004">After listening to me explain these two Canadian examples, members will probably understand why I support the challenges addressed in this bill. However, I will now explain why I will be opposing this bill, even though I recognize these challenges.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6421005">In both of these situations there was one common denominator, the Penticton Indian Band lands that were adversely environmentally impacted by these situations were what is called “locatee lands”. As many are unaware, on some first nations not all land is band land. Some lands are locatee lands. These lands are very similar to privately held land where locatees can make land use decisions independent of locally elected band chiefs and their respective councils. In both of these cases, local non-indigenous business owners made financial deals with band members who control these locatee lands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421006">We all know that the federal government, more specifically Indigenous Services Canada, is supposed to safeguard the interests of aboriginal communities to prevent these types of situations from occurring. Here in Ottawa, we seldom hear how some of these situations are actually caused. This also raises a question that has to be asked. Is it the role of Indigenous Services Canada to tell a locatee family what they can or what they cannot do on their lands, or is that up to a locally elected band chief and council?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421007">I have another question. Was the member approached by a local first nation in her riding to introduce this bill, or is this another example of the “Ottawa knows best” attitude, where Ottawa presents another series of studies to come up with a one-size-fits-all strategy, as it has been doing for decades? I do not know the answer to this question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421008">I see two challenges in this bill. As I mentioned, I would like to be able to support the bill. However, then I would be voting for something that could impact a large number of first nations communities in my region, without having heard how they feel about this bill. I simply cannot in good conscience do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421009">I believe it is time to put an end to the era when decisions were made in Ottawa without first sitting down with the chiefs and local councillors to hear from them directly. Environmental factors clearly have repercussions for first nations. Grassy Narrows comes to mind, as well as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s reference to these issues, which was to thank them for their donation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421010">It is important to study those impacts, but the use of the term “racism” implies that Canadians are racist and responsible for these actions and does not take the Liberal government's failure over the long term into account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421011">Indeed, just this week the Liberal government confirmed it would not meet its clean drinking water promise, another failure.

              <ParaText id="6421014">Mr. Speaker, before getting into the Bloc Québécois's reasons for not supporting this bill, I want to emphasize a few points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421015">First, we recognize that problems related to geographical disparities affect people's standard of living and their access to a quality environment. Second, we are concerned about the fact that newcomers and indigenous communities are more directly affected by these disparities. Last, we fully support government measures to rectify inequalities experienced by the entire population vis-à-vis the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421016">However, Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document>'s provisions create a lot of problems, starting with a direct attack on the environmental sovereignty of Quebec and the provinces. It will therefore come as no surprise that the Bloc Québécois will oppose anything that undermines Quebec legislation and its jurisdiction. Also, it is not at all clear that the federal government would have the constitutional authority to implement the measures proposed in this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421017">That is not all. As my colleague just outlined, there is no definition. As we understand it, there is no definition of environmental racism. When a new concept is introduced into a law, especially when it comes from a very specific theory, it must be clearly defined. In society and in academia, the meaning of concepts may change over time, but the meaning within the law must always be clear, known and recognized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421018">For instance, Bill C-230 makes extensive use of the word “race”. We understand the hon. member's anti-racist and anti-discriminatory intent, and we are not in any way questioning that intent. However, we do have some concerns. The sociological construction of race from such a perspective is not a process on which there is scientific or social consensus.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421028">Last week, I spoke to Bill <Document DbId="10866178" Type="4">C-225</Document> introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252567" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation>. The public engagement I was referring to and the social movements that lead to political battles have the desired impact on government action. These battles are often quite distinct from one another depending on the realities experienced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421029">However, the legislator faces an entirely different challenge. The legislator's responsibility is to make laws that serve justice, of course, but that must apply to all citizens. A good policy is a universal policy. It serves the common good and applies to the entire population. Moreover, universal public policies also end up dismantling inequality structures and discriminatory practices. Choosing the parameter or the lens of race to look at an intersectional phenomenon such as environmental discrimination seems inappropriate in a legislative context.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421034">It is hard, very hard in fact, to explain how Bill <Document DbId="10866225" Type="4">C-230</Document> can include a provision that puts “the administration and enforcement of environmental laws in each province” back into the hands of the federal government, when we have clear examples of the federal government demonstrating its indifference to the legislative mechanisms that are already in place in other administrations. That once again brings me back to Bill C-225, which we debated last week, and to the sad reality of the undue precedence federal legislation takes over environmental concerns and provincial laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421035">Canadian laws are much more permissive than Quebec's laws when it comes to environmental protection, and yet they take precedence over Quebec's laws. We will not give the federal government another opportunity to have even more precedence over the provinces. It already has too much. Canada needs to examine its priorities when it comes to protecting its population from climate change, pollution-related issues, health impacts and all of the inequality that permeates its environmental action. Yes, the federal government needs to address the gaps that Dr. Waldron referred to.</ParaText>

We need to be firm in our legislative intentions of looking out for and eliminating discrimination, but we must do so from a perspective of unity, not division. Take, for example, pay equity, gender equality, universal access to life-sustaining resources, such as drinking water in indigenous communities, and access to justice. In short, we must continue to always fight to ensure that we stop the divide from growing. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6421039">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, again, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> for bringing forward this important issue in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421040">Environmental racism is a huge, but often ignored, problem. In fact, many people are unfamiliar with the concept. As she mentioned, before becoming an MP, I taught a course that focused on environmental racism, and I had my students read the provincial bill that the member for <Affiliation DbId="253130" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> put forward when she was a New Democrat member in the provincial legislature. It is such an important topic and such an important bill. I was disappointed that it never passed provincially, but I am hopeful that we can move this forward federally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421041">Across Canada, toxic dumps, polluting projects, risky pipelines, tainted drinking water and the effects of the climate crisis disproportionately hurt indigenous, Black, and racialized communities. Systemic discrimination has been embedded into environmental policy-making, along with the uneven enforcement of regulations and laws, the targeting of indigenous, Black and racialized communities for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants, and the exclusion of these communities from the decision-making process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421042">We also need to think about this in the context of the fact that we export our waste to countries, predominantly in the global south, and it is often racialized communities that are experiencing the impacts of this toxic pollution. I support the bill, and I believe we need to take urgent action on environmental justice. I would also like to see the right to a healthy environment enshrined in law through an environmental bill of rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421043">Environmental racism in Canada is well documented. It is a direct result of the historic and ongoing impacts of colonization. Many have seen the documentary, <I>There’s Something in the Water</I>, that was referenced. It is based on the report to the Canadian Commission for UNESCO by Dr. Ingrid Waldron. In that documentary, the highlighting of the stories of indigenous and Black communities in Nova Scotia fighting for environmental justice is poignant and powerful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421044">After visiting Canada in 2019, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and hazardous substances and wastes wrote, “I observed a pervasive trend of inaction of the Canadian Government in the face of existing health threats from decades of historical and current environmental injustices”. A report submitted to the Human Rights Council just this September stated that, “Pollution and exposure to toxic chemicals threaten the right to life, and a life with dignity,” and that, “the invisible violence inflicted by toxics is an insidious burden disproportionately borne by Indigenous peoples in Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421045">It is so clear that we have a problem of systemic racism that our government is doing little to nothing to address. In the absence of government action or legislation, and often excluded from the leadership of mainstream environmental movements, indigenous and racialized communities and their allies have been demanding environmental justice, demanding their rights and demanding to be heard. They have recently had some success in the halting of environmentally hazardous projects in their communities, through community organizing, petition signing and civil disobedience, but they should not have to fight not to be poisoned by the air they breathe or the water they drink.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421046">Negative health impacts caused by toxic exposures compound other existing inequalities and the challenges that indigenous and other racialized groups face: low income, poverty, underemployment, unemployment, food insecurity and poor access to health care. All of these things, in addition to more direct impacts on human health, impact environmental racism, which destroys natural environments, causing the loss of access to traditional food sources and cultural practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421047">This disproportionate exposure to toxic substances also contributes to indigenous and racialized people in Canada being locked into a vicious, intergenerational cycle of poverty. The manifestation of illness due to exposure to heavy metals in turn leads to reduced income and reduced earning potential. Lower incomes and poverty are significant factors for why households from racialized communities are less likely than white households to be able to leave environmentally hazardous communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421048">Many of us recognize the names of communities that have been devastated by toxic pollution, but what could have been done to stop it? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421049">In the Chemical Valley, there are 62 large industrial facilities, or about 40% of Canada’s petrochemical industry. They operate within a few kilometres of Sarnia and the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, exposing community members to a range of harmful pollutants causing increased rates of asthma, reproductive effects, learning disabilities and cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421050">There is Grassy Narrows, where ongoing mercury poisoning, first discovered in 1970, has had devastating health effects and contaminated the water and the fish the community relied on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421051">There is Boat Harbour, where an effluent treatment facility for the Northern Pulp mill was built and operated by the provincial government near Pictou Landing First Nation in Nova Scotia. It turned a quiet estuary and fertile hunting and fishing ground into a highly toxic site. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421052">Let us not forget to mention what is maybe the most famous example of environmental racism: Africville.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421053">This is not just about communities that have become infamous sites of toxic pollution. In urban areas across Canada, 25% of the lowest socio-economic status neighbourhoods, which are disproportionally home to racialized people, are within one kilometre of a major polluting industrial facility, compared with just 7% of the wealthiest neighbourhoods, where white families are more likely to live. This results in elevated risks of hospitalization for respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421054">Climate change is taking a disproportionate toll on indigenous peoples. Canada is warming at twice the global rate and northern Canada at about three times the global rate, depleting traditional food sources, driving up the cost of imported alternatives and contributing to a growing problem of food insecurity and related negative health impacts. However, indigenous communities have been fighting back. They have been resilient in the face of this injustice. Canada is not adequately supporting the efforts of indigenous peoples to adapt to the climate crisis and is failing to do its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421055"> The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples needs to be enshrined in law. I am glad to see the government finally tabling a piece of legislation on UNDRIP, but I am concerned its bill is watered down compared with what many indigenous organizers and people across Canada have been fighting for. We need to take into account indigenous science and knowledge in relation to the environment and its protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421056">I also want to talk about the right to a healthy environment. The top recommendation of the UN Human Rights Council in September 2020 was for Canada to recognize in law the right to a healthy environment. Over 150 countries have legal obligations to protect the human right to a healthy environment. Although there are environmental bills of rights in Ontario, Quebec, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, as well as provincial and territorial laws that address environmental rights, there is no federal law that explicitly recognizes the right to a healthy environment in Canada. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA, does not include any reference to environmental justice, human rights or vulnerable populations. It is 20 years out of date and badly needs updating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421057">For many years, my New Democrat colleagues have been advocating for an environmental bill of rights. I want to recognize former NDP MP Linda Duncan, who put forward the bill, and my NDP colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>, who introduced Bill <Document DbId="10866248" Type="4">C-232</Document>, which calls for the recognition of the right of all Canadians to a safe, clean and healthy environment, grounded in a commitment to upholding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

              <ParaText id="6421063">This is a valid concern that resonates particularly in the current context of COVID-19, where impacts of the pandemic have been disproportionately borne by disadvantaged groups. Numerous Statistics Canada studies point to the unequal impacts of the pandemic on various groups. One study, for example, found that immigrants and visible minorities form a larger proportion of front-line workers, including nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates. This suggests that some groups of Canadians likely have been at a greater risk of exposure to the virus than others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421064">Additional evidence from Public Health Ontario suggests that people living in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods have been more likely to get sick from the virus than other Canadians. Various analysis has also shown that particular groups, such as indigenous Canadians, are much more vulnerable. This is a signal that we have to take action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421065">This bill comes at a time when many Canadians are giving careful thought to all aspects of racism, including its environmental aspect. The public is very concerned about the systemic racism experienced by Blacks, indigenous people and people of colour as a result of institutional policies and practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421066">In the throne speech, our government promised to make a concerted and tangible effort to continue the fight against racism. Significant action has already been taken with the release of Canada's anti-racism strategy for 2019-2022, which includes a $45-million investment to take immediate steps in combatting racism and discrimination.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421067">Through the anti-racism action program, the Government of Canada is investing $15 million to fund 85 anti-racism projects that aim to remove systemic barriers faced by racialized communities, religious minorities and indigenous Canadians. We have committed to also furthering transformative change by taking action on online hate; going further on economic empowerment for specific communities; implementing an action plan to increase representation in hiring, appointments and leadership development within the public service; and taking new steps to support the artistic and economic contributions of Black Canadians, culture and heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421068">We know the bill highlights that the efforts to combat systemic racism can intersect with environmental and health concerns. We are taking action in this regard as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421069">The Government of Canada is also committed to continuously improving how vulnerable populations are considered in the assessment and management of chemicals and other substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and other federal statutes. Chemicals are an integral part of everyday life, essential to our health and well-being, the economy, our communities and our homes. While chemical substances may provide benefits, some may also have harmful effects on human health. Some Canadians may be more vulnerable than others to those harmful effects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421070">Where there is information available, departments consider this both in conducting risk assessments and in designing risk management measures. This includes consideration of individuals living in the vicinity of industrial commercial facilities and first nation and Inuit populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421071">To build on our commitments to address the unequal burden of exposure of certain groups to harmful substances, in late 2018 and early 2019, the government undertook consultations on defining vulnerable populations. It was a first step toward a policy framework on vulnerable populations. Feedback received through this consultation process is helping to inform the activities related to chemical assessment and management, including the development of a policy framework to address vulnerable populations under the CEBA.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421078">Mr. Speaker, the pandemic has only amplified existing vulnerabilities of the homeless and those who are precariously housed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421079">People continue to face skyrocketing rents, ballooning home prices and demovictions, and have increasingly resorted to living in encampments. Vancouver East continues to have the largest encampment in the country as the cold, wet weather is upon us, and we are now grappling with the highest rate of COVID-19 in the city, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421080">The urgency for action is more acute than ever. The last time the importance of housing was backed up with serious action federally was after the Second World War, when hundreds of thousands of affordable supportive housing units were built by the government to make sure soldiers returning from the war had places to live. Now, veterans who served our country increasingly find themselves without roofs over their heads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421081">Clearly, the Liberals do not feel the sense of urgency to act that housing providers and housing advocates do. While the Liberals have declared that adequate housing is a basic human right, their actions do not come close to matching their words. It took six months into the pandemic for the Liberals to announce the rapid housing initiative, and their promise will only bring 3,000 new units to address the homelessness crisis. When over 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness every year, even before the pandemic made things worse, 3,000 units simply is not going to cut it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421082">The Canadian Housing and Renewal Association, the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, housing providers and advocates are all saying that this is not good enough. In fact, CHRA is calling for the federal government to increase the rapid housing initiative funding by at least $5 billion. They also want to see the program extended until at least 2028.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421083">Communities also noted that the rapid housing initiative announcement does not include any resources for wraparound social supports and services. For those suffering from chronic homelessness, supportive services are essential for their success. They are calling on the federal government to include additional resources to fund wraparound supports so that proper care can be provided to ensure their success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421084">In Canada, 80% of indigenous people live in urban, rural and northern communities, and they are severely overrepresented in the homeless community. The fact that the announcement did not include a dedicated rapid housing stream for urban, rural and northern indigenous peoples highlights once again how their needs continue to be neglected by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421085">The Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness and CHRA note that when the national housing strategy was announced in 2017, there was nothing included for urban, rural and northern indigenous peoples. Even though the <Affiliation DbId="253372" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> was explicitly told to create an urban, rural and northern indigenous housing strategy in his 2019 mandate letter, a year later there is still no strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421086">The time to act is long overdue. The indigenous caucus of the CHRA is demanding the federal government develop a for-indigenous, by-indigenous national housing centre. They want to see an increase in the supply of stable, safe and affordable indigenous housing by 73,000 units. They want accelerated action on indigenous homelessness, along with wraparound services to support indigenous tenants' well-being and long-term success. They want accelerated action on the elimination of indigenous homelessness, and a focus on northern housing.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6421088">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252890" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> for giving me the opportunity to speak about the rapid housing initiative, which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> launched on October 27. This is an important new program that will quickly give more vulnerable Canadians a place to call home at a time when it is needed most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421089">Some of those hit hardest by COVID-19 are those who also find themselves in precarious housing. This includes seniors, women and children fleeing violence and people experiencing homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421090"> For example, it is impossible to safely shelter in place when people do not have a place to call home. Our government has recognized this and mobilized quickly to offer a number of supports to address these urgent housing needs. This includes additional funding of more than $236 million for reaching home, Canada's homelessness strategy. These funds will help communities to extend and expand the emergency measures put in place at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as provide them with the flexibility to deliver housing solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421091">Many parts of the country are now in the second wave of the pandemic. As my colleague has noted, temperatures are dropping. It is clear that we need more affordable housing. We need it urgently and our government is committed to helping make this happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421092"> That is where our government's rapid housing initiative comes in. This program represents $1 billion in federal investments. It will create 3,000 new permanent affordable housing units across the country. All units will be completed within 12 months from the signing of the funding agreement. It will focus on creating housing for Canadians in severe need, people who are experiencing homelessness or living in temporary shelters as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the program will stimulate the economy, creating good jobs when they are needed most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421093"> The rapid housing initiative will be delivered through Canada's national housing strategy, a 10-year, $55 billion-plus plan, but it will be delivered on a much more accelerated timeline. One half of the program's funds will be delivered directly to cities with the highest levels of housing needs in homelessness. The other half will fund projects led by provinces, territories, municipalities, indigenous organizations and non-profit organizations. All projects funded through this initiative must be completed within one year. The funding can be used to build modular housing, buy land or convert existing buildings for affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421094">I have spoken to our partners in cities, provinces and territories in the housing sector and they advised on the design of the program. They are quickly mobilizing the seizing of this opportunity. Our government is proud to be working hand in hand with these dedicated partners to ensure our most vulnerable people can be safely housed now and can thrive in the years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421095">I will note that the <Affiliation DbId="253812" Type="18">parliamentary secretary for housing</Affiliation> is one of the most able-minded individuals in Canada when it comes to non-profit housing. I am proud to have him as a member of this caucus. I know on numerous occasions he has stated these types of words and in fact he assisted me in this speech. At the end of the day, we have a caring, compassionate government like no other government before it with respect to investments in future development of a truly national housing strategy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421096">Mr. Speaker, 3,000 units in the rapid housing initiative just does not cut it. The fall economic statement failed to indicate that action will be taken to ensure an acquisition fund will be in place to support affordable housing providers in their purchases of distressed housing, while large for-profit capital funds have been buying up distressed housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421097">This was called for as early as March by the former UN housing rapporteur, Ms. Leilani Farha. She wrote to the government on April 19 about this and it is now December and the government still has not even had the courtesy to respond to her. Her suggestion is further supported by many other housing advocates, including the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. The Globe and Mail wrote an article indicating that private buyers are lining up to try to get their hands on rental towers, especially the older buildings, which tend to have lower rents.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6421101">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be here to have a conversation about a question I asked regarding Nav Canada and the possibility that the air control tower at the Regina International Airport may cease to exist in the not-too-distant future. This is a very important conversation for the people of Saskatchewan, southwest Saskatchewan and Regina. I look forward to getting an answer from the member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>. I hope he does not just read speaking points and that we have a dialogue, a conversation between two parliamentarians about something that is very important for not only Saskatchewan but western Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421102"> I was able to have a conversation with not only the member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> but also the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>. I asked a question, and the response I got was not really favourable to the people of Regina—Lewvan. Regina International Airport is in the heart of Regina—Lewvan, and it is very important to ensure that, when we come out of the COVID-19 pandemic, flights can come in and out safely. It will be a big part of our economic recovery when we see the light at the end of the tunnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421103">I have had conversations with representatives from Nav Canada, and they talked about the complexity of flights that come into our air zone. One thing we need to take into account when it comes to having an air traffic control tower is that 15 Wing Moose Jaw, the training base for the RCAF, is in the same air zone as Regina. For complex flights, we want to keep our military pilots safe. There are flights coming into that air zone that are going 600 to 900 kilometres per hour, so it is a very complex situation. We need professional people at the control tower to make sure that our military personnel are safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421104">Also, as I am sure the member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> would know, we have the world-famous Snowbirds at 15 Wing Moose Jaw, which fly out of Moose Jaw. They can take up the same airspace as the international airport in Regina. Therefore, the safety of all these complex flights should be taken into account when we are having this conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421105">When it comes down to it, Regina is also a provincial capital. If we did not have an air traffic control tower in Regina, it would be the only provincial capital in the country that did not have safety measures in place. I think that sends a signal to people, not only in Regina and Saskatchewan but in western Canada. A provincial capital that does not have an air traffic control tower sends the wrong signal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421106">I remember as clear as day on election night when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that he heard what western Canadians were saying. He said he was going to be there to make sure their concerns were heard, but we have not seen that in the last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421107">For this one reason, I think it is time for the Liberal government to step up and assure western Canadians that the safety and complexity of all these flights in the Regina International Airport's airspace are taken into consideration. For once I hope the government is listening to western Canadians and will take the complexity and safety of our Snowbirds, our Royal Canadian Air Force and all of the pilots at 15 Wing Moose Jaw into consideration when it makes these decisions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421108">Mr. Speaker, I will put my notes to the side and make it a discussion more so than a speech. I assure the member I will take the time to raise the issue with the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. I do not say that lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421109">I spent a few years in Saskatchewan in my younger days. In fact, I am very familiar with the Snowbirds as I went to the air show in Moose Jaw. I am also very much familiar with air traffic control because I was actually a member of the Canadian Forces and I was an air traffic control assistant. I worked out of the tower in Lancaster Park, which had the longest runway at 14,000 feet. The space shuttle could land there, which is something I have reminded the current <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> of. I also have family who live in Regina. Go Riders. We all love the Riders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421110">We understand the importance that airports play in our communities, whether they are the smaller airports we see scattered throughout the Prairies, the ones in larger centres like Regina or our international airports such as the Calgary airport. I am sure my friend has been to the Calgary airport. It is a massive and growing airport. We have different types of airports that provide all sorts of services. I understand the importance of towers. I also understand the importance of issues, having worked on radar, air zones and so forth. Safety is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421111">Nav Canada has a high level of expertise that I do not have and I suspect the member opposite might not necessarily have. That is why it is important we get that good understanding. If there is something that can be done that is practical, I assure the member we are listening and very much interested in what we can do to further the cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421112">One of the nice things that just came out in the budget presentation, the mini-budget, was the idea that we need to have a prairie investment fund. I see that as a sign to the Prairies that the government is very much concerned that all three beautiful Prairie provinces, and I have lived in all three, get the attention they need. I understand personally the importance of our airports and towers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421113">I will take the member's comments and at some point have that discussion. I do not know when, but I will have that discussion with the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421115">I ask him to make sure, when he does have that conversation with the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, that the minister knows the complexity of the flights going on at the Regina International Airport. I believe, and I hope the member opposite would agree, flight information services provide a valuable service, but it is not quite the same service as an air traffic control tower in the fact that there are a few different words such as “you may land”, “you could land” or “you are cleared for takeoff”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421116">The member will understand these words and the differences between the services provided by the different entities. I hope he will help me in making sure the Regina International Airport has an air traffic control tower going forward, based on the complexity of the flights, the Snowbirds, the 15 Wing air force base in Moose Jaw and the seriousness in ensuring the brave men and women who serve there have the safety and services they deserve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421119">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in adjournment proceedings. My question goes back to remarks I made in question period. While it was a question, I am not sure that we got a real answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421120">Of course, this goes back to the WE scandal. This summer, we saw the now infamous Canada student service grant presented to Canadians worth $912 million. Before the program was able to launch, it was cancelled. We had the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> apologize for failing to recuse himself. The then finance minister apologized for failing to recuse himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421121">The WE organization was right at the centre of it. The reason the recusals would have been necessary for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and for the former finance were that members of the Prime Minister's family had been paid nearly half a million dollars by the WE organization. He then he turned around and gave approval for Canadian tax dollars for this organization to administer a half a billion dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421122">The former finance minister's challenges came out of him having his daughter directly employed by this organization. He accepted $40,000 in free vacations from this organization. Both the then finance minister and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> were at the cabinet table when this was approved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421123">We look back to very recent history and this is the first Prime Minister in Canadian history found guilty of breaking ethics laws. We have seen that detailed in the “Trudeau Report” and the “Trudeau Report II”. That was, in the first instance, for the Prime Minister's trip to billionaire island. In the second instance, it was his interference in the criminal prosecution for his friends as SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421124">We now have an issue that will be the subject of the third report coming from the Ethics Commissioner where we have this situation where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family received half a million dollars and he turned around to give that organization half a billion dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421125">What happened when the committee investigations got too hot for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on the eve of documents to be disclosed to the finance committee and documents to be released to the ethics committee? The Prime Minister shut down Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421126">We do not have to remember too far back into history when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that sunlight was the best disinfectant. When the Prime Minister prorogued, he said there would be lots of time for questions when the House resumes. Then the House resumed and what did we have? Over 40 hours of filibuster from the Liberals at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421127">We are going to hear from the <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> about Conservatives looking for scandals under every rock, but the question to the parliamentary secretary is very clear. If there is nothing to hide and if the government has the courage of its convictions, why not just let these matters come to a vote? Why filibuster? Why give rise to the appearance of corruption if, as he will tell us, there is none? We have seen them obstruct, filibuster and look to block rightful questions by the official opposition and by parliamentarians into the conduct of the government. It is unbecoming of a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is shaking the confidence Canadians have in their parliamentarians and in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421128">We need to get back to good, ethical government. I look for Canadians to have that opportunity after the next election by electing a Conservative government with the Prime Minister being from the riding of Durham. In the meantime, we need the current, temporary occupant of the Prime Minister's Office to do his part and let the sun shine in.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421129">Mr. Speaker, I am sure you would not be surprised to hear that we already have a good, ethical government, a government that understands and appreciates the importance of accountability and transparency. The opposition parties saying this is a scandal does not make it a scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421130">Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to participate in a lot of the discussions on this topic, primarily because of other commitments, but I would not concede to the official opposition that there is this huge scandal. It is interesting when my friend references, as he did today in his three or four minutes, that this is the first <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has been held in violation by the Ethics Commissioner. There is nothing of that nature. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421131">It was Stephen Harper who brought in the Ethics Commissioner, so it is not as though the commissioner was there for other prime ministers. However, the member tries to give the impression that we have a really bad prime minister. The Ethics Commissioner, after all, found a couple of examples where the Prime Minister made some mistakes, which the Prime Minister owned up to. He apologized where he needed to apologize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421132">The focus of the Conservatives in opposition, since day one, has always been what I would classify as character assassination. They do not care what the policies are. They go after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the minister of finance, or any minister, and talk scandal, whether it exists or not. That is what they want to talk about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421133">The member referenced the filibuster, saying the Liberals are bad because we have been doing 40 hours of filibustering, as the Conservatives are being somewhat mischievous and looking under every rock for a scandal. They are calling for civil servant after civil servant to go before the committee. I think my colleagues did a good job of ensuring that this government continues, even though the opposition continues to look for made-up conspiracies, in some cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421134">We continue to be focused on the coronavirus. That has been clearly demonstrated. While Conservatives would rather have civil servants answering questions about conspiracy, we prefer civil servants doing what they do best, which is serving Canadians by minimizing the negative damage of the coronavirus. That has been our priority, and that has been demonstrated with the many programs we have introduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421135">We have been talking a lot about vaccinations lately, and justifiably so. I asked the Conservative opposition during debate the other day where the thousands of questions about the vaccination issue were during the summer, in July and August. No, they wanted to fan this whole notion that there is this huge scandal. There was no huge WE scandal. Yes, there were some mistakes, and those mistakes are very well established, but the government continues to focus its attention on the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421136">As much as the Conservatives try to divert our attention, we are continuing to focus on the coronavirus. I would encourage my friend to try to influence his caucus colleagues to do likewise.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421138">The Conservatives brought in these accountability measures and were not found guilty of breaking any of them because we did not. Then Canadians elected the Liberal government, which immediately fell into the trap we set for it. What was the trap? Do not break the law. Do not break the rules. That proved impossible for the Liberals. Nothing needed to be fabricated. No conspiracies needed to be formed. We have seen time and time again with the Liberals that the only thing they want to do, other than help themselves, is to help their well-connected insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421139">The member opposite needs to implore his colleagues to do the right thing and let the sunshine in and, guess what, the opposition will hold them to account on financial matters, the pandemic response and their ethical transgressions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6421140">Mr. Speaker, I assure the member we are doing the right thing. I am not saying we have been an absolutely perfect government. There have been areas where we have made some mistakes, but when that has occurred we owned up to those mistakes and where necessary apologized. We continue to work co-operatively with the Ethics Commissioner and other independent officers of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6421141">However, let there be no doubt. We are going to continue our focus on combatting the negative impacts of the pandemic and supporting Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. Those are the priorities of this government and they will continue to be its priorities.</ParaText>
