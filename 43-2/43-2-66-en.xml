We have a right, as members, to hear a motion before we decide whether we are going to support it or not, but we cannot have someone use technology to continually obstruct an effort to put a motion on the floor.

The Conservatives are very much in support of the report and of all of its recommendations. The report highlights the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong and the need for action by the government. We are pleased to see the report call for the universal suffrage of Hong Kongers, the application of sanctions by Canada, strong immigration measures, and two key measures to counter China's foreign influence operations here that are threatening Canadians.</ParaText>

One is with respect to stronger actions around foreign state interference in Canada following the adoption of a motion by the House of Commons on that issue on November 18. The other additional recommendation within our supplementary report calls for the government to begin discussions on when to review whether it continues to be appropriate for a Canadian judge to sit as a non-permanent judge on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.</ParaText>

They note that the carbon tax is not an effective way of responding to the environmental challenges that we face. </ParaText>

First, from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of all my colleagues, we cannot imagine the stress you are under in regards to a live sitting as well as technology. I want to thank you and all our deputy Speakers for accepting the challenge to wrestle with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514435">Also, this is my 16th year, and sometimes it takes a little to reflect on what has just happened to bring my concerns. This is with respect to the point of order from my colleagues for <Affiliation DbId="252804" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>, Langley City, my friend for <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> as well as a Bloc member, whose riding I do not recall, in regard to the point of order from the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514436"> I just watched two points of order, one on the floor, technical, and one on technology that was germane to the petition that was being presented. Mr. Speaker, you have quite a challenge. However, may I suggest that whatever rules you have for a member inside the chamber interrupting someone who is moving a point of order should be consistent with technology. I have noticed that people can actually interrupt a member who is moving a point of order in the chamber. It is a matter of consistency. Again, I cannot imagine the challenge you face, and we are glad for your service to the chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514437">Finally, the point I would like to make is that I have no idea whether the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> actually did any consultations. He certainly did not talk to me. In moving forward, for all my colleagues, everything in this chamber is based on the honour system in that we always trust that members bring about those things which are relevant and true. If someone gets up on a point of order and says that there were consultations and that has not occurred, that erodes your capability, Mr. Speaker, of trust in the honour of members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514438"> I wanted to share with my colleagues the point that if that is the case, then fine. If it is not, then please do not posit a point of order or any other claim in that fashion. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514444">As to the fact that hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252880" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation> was concerned about being muted, the technology people do mute people who have their microphones on if it is not their turn. I want to point out that it is to avoid embarrassment more than anything else, because we have had situations of people speaking without knowing that their microphone was on. If it is not their turn, it is very awkward for everyone. Just for the good functioning of the House, we have instructed the technicians that if someone is not speaking, they should please mute them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514445">The other thing is the matter of rising on a point of order. By all means, we want to be as close as possible to what is going on in the chamber. Usually the person stands and claims a point of order. I would ask anyone who is bringing up a point of order to please raise their hand, as well as bringing up the point of order verbally. When they push on the unmute button to speak and then get muted again or mute themselves, it gives a nice clear signal to the Chair, making it easy for everyone. For that, thank you to all of you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514446">Regarding what was done yesterday, it was certainly an interesting time in the chamber, but what happens is that the Chair is in the hands of the House and how the members would like the Chair to conduct business. We have to go by the rules that are in place. There is flexibility to respond to the changes in motions following discussions among parties, and that is where the Chair has to use judgment as to whether there was a certain amount of discussion that had taken place and if there was something that has changed within the chamber or within the members' understanding of what is there. A lot of it has to do with the Chair's trust in the honour of the members in the chamber. Without that honour, I am not sure we will go very far in this chamber. I really do rely on the hon. members being as honourable as humanly possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514447">Finally, there were proceedings intervening between the requests made yesterday and today. Something went on between what happened yesterday in the chamber and today. That was my understanding. That is just to clarify what has happened.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514449">Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up to seek further clarification about what you just said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514450">I think that in the case of members who are inadvertently unmuted and are having side conversations, it clearly would be helpful for the technicians to take steps to mute them. That situation is different from a member trying to raise a point of order, trying to intervene or exercising their right to offer a side comment, all of which are part of the traditions of this place. These things are certainly part of what happens in the House of Commons, and it would be a very different case if technicians were muting them or repeatedly muting them in that case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514451">This is important, because every week members are making a decision about whether to participate virtually or to come to Ottawa. From a health and safety perspective, it is easier if many members are able to participate virtually, but if their virtual participation is in any way different from what it is in the House of Commons, it creates a serious problem, I think, for managing the numbers that can be in the House. Many more members may feel they need to be physically present in the House if they feel their opportunity for an intervention may potentially be limited by being muted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514452">I believe I heard you say that technicians are empowered to mute people who seem to be unmuted by error. I think that is very reasonable, but if members are repeatedly trying to unmute themselves and they are repeatedly being muted, it raises issues about whether there is inequality between members participating virtually and members who are participating in person.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514456">You, Mr. Speaker, along with the staff, have been very much trying to replicate, as much as possible, the procedures in the House. We have to recognize that when members are in the House, you choose when someone has the microphone. When members are at home and working remotely, I am hearing the argument that we should have control of our microphones, but I would like to say, as you reflect on this, that we should follow the House procedure as closely as possible. Members have the ability to raise their hands and be recognized as if they were standing in the House, which is better than continuously interrupting and disrespecting those who are speaking and have the right to speak because the Speaker has recognized them and given them the right to speak.</ParaText>

What we see online is that certain members, including particularly the member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan, use technology to obstruct and to interfere, and then attack the House technical staff, which I find very concerning, because they are trying to do their job for you. </ParaText>

You would have allowed the member speaking to finish and then recognized him.

              <ParaText id="6514467">It is with considerable emotion that I rise on this supply day to speak to the Bloc Québécois motion. We hope that the House will “(a) recognize that the elderly were most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) recall that too many of the elderly live in a financially precarious position; (c) acknowledge the collective debt that we owe to those who built Quebec and Canada; and (d) ask the government, in the next budget, to increase the Old Age Security benefit by $110 a month for those aged 65 and more.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514468">I would like to remind the House that the reason I am so passionate about this morning's topic is that, before I was elected, I spent two years as a project manager, raising awareness of elder abuse and intimidation. Every day I looked for ways to improve the living conditions of seniors in my region and, taking things one step further, advocate for well-treatment. It did not take me long to realize that there is a direct and, sadly, all-too-frequent connection between financial precarity and vulnerability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514469">As the first member to speak to this important motion, I would like to focus on three issues. I will start by discussing the precarious financial situation that prevailed long before the pandemic. Then I will explain how the crisis made things even worse for seniors. Finally, I will talk about how the Bloc Québécois has spent years working to improve seniors' buying power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514470">First, I would like to point out that the Bloc Québécois is not the only party to have recognized that we need to shrink this huge economic gap. During the 2019 election campaign, the Liberals themselves looked seniors straight in the eye and promised to increase old age security benefits by 10% for seniors 75 and up. They reiterated their intent to increase the OAS in the September 2020 throne speech, but it has been radio silence since then and nothing has been done yet. Regardless, we feel that their proposal is just not good enough and that it unfairly creates two classes of seniors, because poverty does not wait until people turn 75.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514471">Now let us take a moment to debunk a few myths. The old age security program is the federal government's principal means of supporting seniors. The two major components of the program are old age security, or OAS, and the guaranteed income supplement, or GIS. The OAS is a taxable monthly pension available to people aged 65 and over. The GIS, meanwhile, is a tax-free monthly benefit available to OAS recipients with an annual income under $18,648, despite the OAS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514472">The OAS is regulated by the Old Age Security Act and aims to provide a minimum income for people aged 65 and over. This program is not based on benefit funding. In other words, seniors do not need to have paid into it in order to qualify. The OAS provides seniors with a basic income to which they can add income from other sources like the Quebec pension plan or an employer's pension plan, depending on their specific financial situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514473">Let us look at some revealing figures. When, despite old age security benefits, income is below $18,648 for a single, widowed, or divorced person, $24,624 when the person's spouse receives the full OAS pension, or still $44,688 when the spouse does not get OAS, the person has access to an additional benefit through the OAS program called the guaranteed income supplement, or GIS. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514474">That is a lot of figures, but the point I am trying to make is that the problem is twofold. Since the pension amounts for seniors are so low, people for whom this is the only source of income are condemned to live below the poverty line. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514475">As of October 2020, people whose only income is old age security and the maximum guaranteed income supplement receive an annual income of $18,358.92, or barely the equivalent of the subsistence level established by the market basket measure, which is between $17,370 and $18,821. In the last quarter of 2020, the federal government increased monthly payments by $1.52 for a total of $18 a year. That is the anemic increase given to the least fortunate who receive the maximum of both benefits.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514476">That is ridiculous. Many seniors who contacted us were outraged because they felt that the Liberals were blatantly laughing at them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514477">The indexation of benefits is insufficient to cover the increase in the cost of living because seniors spend money on items different from those used to calculate inflation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514478">Recently, we talked about the Internet, which should also be considered essential because it lets them stay in contact with their loved ones during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514479">The current crisis has created serious financial difficulties for a great number of people, including many seniors. Some seem to think that the economic shutdown does not affect seniors because they are no longer working, but that is not true. First, a good number of them are working, especially older women. In my opinion, this shows the urgency of the measures that are being called for. If they are receiving a pension and feel that they must work, they must not have enough income support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514480">I am the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women and since the summer I have had the opportunity to study the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women, especially older women. Many seniors want to continue working even if they have reached retirement age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514481">Some seniors were affected by fluctuations in their investments or retirement savings. They live on a fixed income, and most of them receive a pension. However, the cost of living is going up for them, as it is for everyone, on expenses such as rent, groceries, medication and services. Rent and food prices have gone up because of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514482">Prices in Quebec are estimated to rise by about 4% in 2021, which would surpass general inflation. Prices have also increased because pandemic-related delivery fees have been introduced, there is a shortage of some products and some chains have adopted so-called COVID fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514483">The indexation of benefits for the last quarter of 2020 speaks for itself. According to the consumer price index, benefits increased by 0.1% in the quarter from October to December 2020. As I just pointed out, this means that the poorest seniors receiving the maximum amounts of the two benefits get an increase of $1.52. That is not even enough to buy a Tim Hortons coffee. I am in regular contact with representatives from FADOQ, and they have rightly pointed out that this indexation is insulting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514484">Let us summarize the support measures the government has proposed. We realize that the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB, was introduced to help people during the pandemic and that it has proven helpful. This $2,000 monthly benefit was deemed adequate for allowing people to live decently during the pandemic. Meanwhile, old age security benefits do not even reach this amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514485">In 1975, the old age pension covered 20% of the average industrial wage. Today, it covers about 13%. With our proposal, we aim to raise that coverage to at least 15%. In the end, old age pensions often do not even manage to lift seniors out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514486">Increasing seniors' income would not only afford them a better quality of life, which they have long deserved, but also help them face the current crisis and participate in our economic recovery. This has been a priority for the Bloc since well before the pandemic, when we were already asking for a $50 increase to the monthly guaranteed income supplement for people living alone and a $70 increase for couples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514487">Yes, there was a one-time payment of $300 pour those who receive the old age security pension and $200 for those who receive the guaranteed income supplement. There was also an extra GST/HST payment. These additional measures are welcome in the very specific context of the pandemic, but they were just one-off payments. That is the problem. The insufficient indexing of benefits for seniors was already a problem before the pandemic. It is still a problem and it will continue after the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514488">Moreover, here is a little comparison that is quite striking. Former Governor General Julie Payette gets a pension for life of almost $150,000, plus an expense account. Seniors would be quite happy with much less. A rise of $110 per month would not change their lives, but it would help. Seniors really feel the impact of the pandemic, and we must look after them because they are also very much isolated and more at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514489">To conclude, I would like to talk about the importance of increasing health transfers. It is also part of what seniors are asking for. They are not interested in national standards. They do not think that will get them a vaccine. There is also a concern about vaccine procurement. We learned that seniors 85 and over would start to be vaccinated, but when will vaccines be available for all seniors who have been living in isolation for much too long?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514490">Finally, I will simply say that we must act for our seniors. They must have a decent income. They must be able to have a much more dignified life. They built Quebec, and they deserve our concern. Their purchasing power must be increased. We have left them in poverty for too long.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514493">Madam Speaker, as I said in my speech, there are lots of reasons why the seniors we have heard from do not understand the government's determination to do that at some point. I said “at some point”, because the Liberals say they plan to increase OAS. They made that promise during the 2019 campaign and reiterated it in the throne speech when we came back to work in 2020, but there has been no news yet. We still do not know what is going to happen with that. That is one thing. We are really eager to see if they do it, but their plan is for people 75 and up. I want to make that point because OAS starts at 65. At 65, people who retire bring in less income. Isolation, lockdown and rising prices are affecting all seniors, not just 75-year-olds. This is affecting people 65 and up too. OAS starts at 65, so the logical thing to do is to boost it for those 65 and up.</ParaText>

However, my colleague is right: The increase based on an absurd indexing system meant that seniors did not even have enough money to buy an extra cup of coffee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514497">I had some calls from seniors over the holidays. They are being forced to make tough choices at the end of the month. Seniors are saying it is difficult for them to put healthy food on the table and find adequate housing. As we know, many seniors want to stay in their homes. That is important to them. Seniors tell us that they need to stay in touch with their families, but Internet services are expensive, and some have had to buy tablets or computers. When you add it all up, you wonder how they manage to stay in touch with their loved ones. These are the kinds of costs that seniors talk to me about.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514506">I will focus my comments on rising poverty levels among seniors; the impact of that poverty on physical health, but also on mental health; the ineffective existing measures; and above all, possible solutions. There are indeed solutions to this issue, and we must ensure once and for all that seniors can have a decent retirement. That is our goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514507">If there is one thing I think we should recognize today, and should have recognized long ago, it is that seniors are getting poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514508">One in five seniors in Quebec were living in poverty in 2017, based on a poverty threshold of 50% of median income. If we look at Canada as a whole, 15.4% of seniors were living in poverty in 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514509">The majority of these seniors are people who, upon retirement, have no income other than the guaranteed income supplement and old age security benefits. I want to emphasize that these benefits are not nearly enough to cover seniors' everyday needs. Sadly, seniors are often forced to continue working long past retirement age. Between 2002 and 2014, the employment rate among seniors aged 65 and over increased by 50%, rising from 12% to 19%. Figures show that more than three in 10 seniors aged 65 to 70 choose to continue working. Do my colleagues think it is right that seniors who worked their entire lives are forced to continue working because their pension income is not enough?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514510">I am happy that some seniors are still working, but that should be their choice and not be dictated by a lack of income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514511">Furthermore, poverty has an impact, especially on seniors' mental health. Poverty causes stress, worry and anxiety. It is stressful to be struggling to make ends meet, to be afraid of not being able to meet current and future needs, and to have only enough money for necessities and nothing more. For seniors to stay healthy as they age and to have a decent retirement, they must have enough income to not only meet their basic needs, but also to pay for activities and hobbies. They must be able to afford to visit and host their loved ones. They must be able to afford to actively participate in their community.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514512">Aging already brings with it a lot of changes, which can lead to illness. People need to adapt to those changes, and that can be stressful. We, as parliamentarians, must ensure that a lack of income is not an additional stressor. At the risk of repeating myself, the existing measures are not meeting those needs and not alleviating that stress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514513">As my colleague said, in June 2020, an individual whose only income was old age security and the guaranteed income supplement had an annual income of barely $18,000. For a single, divorced or widowed senior, that is about $1,500 a month. In Quebec, public pensions are the sole source of income for approximately 60% of seniors, meaning that they do not have a supplementary plan. Most of those seniors are women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514514">It is no secret that this amount barely covers an individual's basic needs, as calculated using the market basket measure. That is not nearly enough. In fact, that measure is also something that should be reviewed. Instead of the market basket measure, we should establish a livable income measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514515">Does it seem right that, over the past 10 years, old age security benefits have increased by only $91 a month?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514516">Successive governments, both Conservative and Liberal, have failed on that front. They let seniors down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514517">The current government promised that it would take the situation seriously. However, the most recent announcements lead me to believe otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514518">Does it seem right that the latest adjustment only represents an increase of $1.50 a month? Does it seem right that benefits only increased by 0.1% in the quarter from October to December 2020?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514519"> The FADOQ has called this increase an insult, and rightly so. As my colleague said, it would not even buy a cup of coffee. Is the well-being of our seniors not worth more than the price of a cup of coffee per month? I think that in asking the question, we have our answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514520">The Bloc Québécois has repeatedly called on the government to help low-income seniors and has proposed concrete measures for doing so. We propose boosting the retirement income of all Canadians aged 65 or older by $110 a month. I remind members that 60% of the population relies solely on pension income as their basic income. We propose increasing the guaranteed income supplement by $50 a month for single seniors and by $70 a month for senior couples. We also propose continuing to pay guaranteed income supplement benefits to the deceased's estate or to their surviving spouse for three months after the death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514521">These are simple, effective solutions for addressing senior poverty right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514522">In conclusion, there are three things I would like our colleagues to take away from our speeches today. First, seniors worked all their lives and deserve a sufficient income for a decent retirement. Second, rising senior poverty is not an intellectual conceit but a reality. Third, the pandemic has aggravated seniors' poverty levels. Today, thousands of seniors are in need and worried about their future, even after the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514523">As parliamentarians, we have a duty to take the situation seriously, to take action and to do everything in our power to fight senior poverty. That is why I urge my colleagues to support our motion, and I urge the government to act quickly by implementing meaningful measures to make sure that seniors can have a decent retirement now. There is nothing to gain from making seniors poorer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514551">I thank the Bloc Québécois and my hon. colleagues for their shared interest in discussing how we can best support seniors in Quebec and across Canada. I appreciate their speeches so far today, although I disagree with some of their assertions regarding the support the government has provided for seniors, confusing the indexing of pensions with the extra COVID-19 support that was provided. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514552">I always appreciate opportunities to discuss what we are doing for seniors and to have parliamentarians recognize the challenges they are facing, especially during the pandemic. The Bloc Québécois has pointed out some challenges that seniors face in its motion today. Since day one, we have been working to address those challenges with action. We, as a government, have long seen that seniors need an active federal government working closely with provincial, territorial and local governments to deliver important benefits and programs for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514553">Our Liberal government is committed to strengthening Canadian seniors' financial security and health care, and improving their quality of life. Some of our first actions as a government were restoring the age of eligibility for old age security to 65 years of age from 67 years of age, increasing the guaranteed income supplement for nearly 900,000 low-income single seniors, and enhancing the Canada pension plan by 50% for future retirees. That increase was matched in the Quebec pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514554">Since the pandemic hit early last year, we have been busy supporting Canadians, including seniors. More than four million seniors received an extra GST credit. We provided a one-time payment to seniors eligible for OAS, plus extra support for those eligible for the GIS. For a low-income couple, it added up to over $1,500 in tax-free support. Altogether, we delivered over twice as much direct financial assistance to seniors as we committed to in our platform. That provided $3.8 billion of direct financial support to seniors, and that work continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514555">In the last election, we committed to Canadians that we would increase old age security by 10% for seniors aged 75 and up. Our proposal recognizes that as seniors age, their financial security decreases and their needs increase. They are more likely to outlive their savings, have disabilities, be unable to work and be widowed, all while their health care costs are rising. For seniors over 75, few work, and those who do have a median employment income of only $720; half have a disability, and half of these are severe; 57% are women, and four in 10 of these are widows; 59% have incomes below $30,000 and 39% receive the guaranteed income supplement. These are real pressures on older seniors' quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514556">Our government recognizes their needs and will help address them by increasing the old age security amount by 10% for seniors aged 75 and up. This will be the first permanent increase to the OAS pension since 1973, other than adjustments due to inflation. We developed these initiatives by listening to seniors; however, the Bloc fails to recognize the actions that we have been taking since the beginning of the pandemic to support seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514557">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252623" Type="2">Beloeil—Chambly</Affiliation>, the Bloc leader, has made comments that mislead seniors. We heard that again today, in speeches about what the government has been doing to support seniors with regard to their personal finances. He told seniors that they got practically nothing in support during the pandemic. In fact, a low-income senior got over $1,500 in tax-free support. That is far from nothing, and provided a significant boost to the most vulnerable seniors struggling with added costs during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514558">The Bloc has also told seniors that their pensions are constantly losing their buying power. In fact, their public pensions are indexed to protect their buying power against inflation. The Bloc should not be trying to mislead seniors when they are the most vulnerable during the pandemic. I welcome good debates about how to best support seniors, but they need to be based on facts. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514559">The Bloc has also failed to recognize seniors' broader needs during the pandemic and how the federal government has been stepping up to address those needs. Let us start with the public health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514560">We have provided provinces and territories billions of dollars to help protect Canadians' health during the pandemic. We have procured billions of pieces of personal protective equipment. Seniors have suffered the most from the effects of COVID-19 and have paid the highest price with their lives, none more so than those living in long-term care. While many of these facilities have been able to keep their residents safe, others have revealed the weaknesses in the system and have shocked the nation. There is clearly a call for action to address these issues and our government has stepped up to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514561">Provinces and territories have the jurisdiction for long-term care and we are working together with them to better protect seniors and staff in the long-term care system. We recently added $1 billion to the funding to assist with infection prevention in long-term care. We have expanded eligibility for federal infrastructure funds so they can be used to modernize and renovate long-term care facilities. We are also working to set new national standards with the provinces and territories, and we will establish new offences and penalties in the Criminal Code related to elder abuse and neglect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514562">To help address acute labour shortages in long-term care and home care, we are funding training and work placements for 4,000 new personal support worker interns. We have provided $3 billion to the provinces and territories to increase the wages of long-term care workers and other low-income essential workers. Furthermore, we have provided the provinces with over 22 million rapid tests, with more on the way. We know that rapid tests are an important way to protect seniors in long-term care homes, according to a federal expert panel. By strengthening screening, rapid tests can save lives and give worried families greater confidence that their loved ones are safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514563">Another tool to help keep seniors safe in Canada is our vaccine plan. Canada has distributed over 1.8 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to provinces and territories. By the end of March, we are on track to receive six million doses. Following that, we will be receiving millions of doses in April. We will be seeing seniors and essential workers getting vaccinated as we move into spring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514564">The hard work that is being done in the provinces, cities and by Canadians over the last few months has worked. Cases are down, hospitalizations are down and the number of deaths is down. However, the threat from variants is real, so we have to keep going with strong public health measures; otherwise, we could see a third wave that is worse than the second before vaccines have been rolled out and our seniors can be protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514565">Our government will always be there as a partner with provinces to keep people safe, working together with a team Canada approach, and that is what will get us through this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514566">I would like to say a few words about seniors' mental health. We cannot let physical distancing become social distancing. We need to find new ways to help seniors stay connected while they are staying safe. Through the New Horizons for Seniors program, we added an additional $20 million in support. The federal government has funded over 2,000 community projects across Canada. Many of these projects have helped seniors connect online for the first time by providing tablets and help on how to use them, and group activities like exercise classes. Others helped seniors continue to access critical services like medical appointments, food and crisis support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514567">Looking ahead, our government has an ambitious agenda for seniors. That includes increasing old-age security by 10% once a senior turns 75, taking additional action to help people stay in their homes longer, providing a new Canadians disability benefit modelled after the GIS, ensuring that everyone has access to a family doctor or primary care team, continuing to support Canadians with mental illness and substance-use challenges, and further increasing access to mental health resources. We are also accelerating work to achieve national universal pharmacare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514568">We know there is more to do and, as a government, we are doing that work. I look forward to the debate today and to answering some questions now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514572">Madam Speaker, I thank the member for addressing the fact that all seniors aged 65 and up have been facing increased expenses and issues, especially during the pandemic. That is why the government stepped up to provide the additional $300 for all seniors aged 65 who are on the OAS. Those who were on the guaranteed income supplement got an additional $200. As has been mentioned, a low-income senior couple, those who are struggling the most, received over $1,500 in direct tax-free support. That was significant support for our most vulnerable seniors, who definitely were struggling during the pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514584">Madam Speaker, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Seniors and as the member for Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation, I am pleased to take the floor today and participate in this important discussion on seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514585">I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional unceded territory of the Anishinabe Algonquin people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514586">Our work to help seniors began in 2016, when our government's first act was to adopt a tax cut for the middle class in order to reduce personal income taxes. This allowed some single Canadians to save an average of $330, and some couples to save $540, per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514587">Seniors depend on solid public pensions, and our government is committed to enhancing them. We eliminated the increase in the age of eligibility for old age security and the guaranteed income supplement proposed by the previous Conservative government, bringing it back down from 67 to 65. This put thousands of dollars back in the pockets of 65-year-old and 66-year-old seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514588">To help low-income seniors, we increased the guaranteed income supplement by $947 and, to help low-income older workers keep a larger portion of their benefits, we increased the guaranteed income supplement earnings exemption, allowing them to earn up to $5,000 without losing any of their benefits and to obtain a partial exemption for the next $10,000 in earnings. Many seniors wish to continue working after age 65.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514589">Many Canadian seniors have had to face serious health, economic and social challenges because of COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been helping seniors with non-taxable payments and enhanced community assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514590">These measures are based on the previous programs introduced in response to COVID-19, such as the GST supplement and investments in community organizations that provide essential services, such as food and drug delivery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514591">As we face this unprecedented challenge, our government continues to be there for Canadians and seniors every step of the way. Our government has provided seniors with twice as much financial assistance as we promised during the election. We were able to do so by issuing non-taxable one-time GST credits in April and old age security and guaranteed income security payments in July. We invested $3.8 billion, which is far more than the $1.56 billion we campaigned on. This allowed us to help seniors of all ages earlier on by providing the more vulnerable with greater support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514592">In addition, we increased the basic personal amount twice. Once these increases are fully in place in 2023, 4.3 million seniors will benefit, and 465,000 of them will pay no federal income tax at all. Each year, single Canadians will save around $300 and couples around $600.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514593">We know that COVID-19 has increased the cost of living and that seniors’ lives have become more difficult. Because of the restrictions, many of them are grappling with higher costs for food and services. They pay more for the same prescription drugs plus an additional premium for delivery. Their savings have taken a hit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514594">Our announcement of the one-time tax-free payment in July provided direct assistance for the most vulnerable seniors of all ages, in particular those receiving the guaranteed income supplement and old age security, for up to $500 extra for seniors receiving both. Combined with the GST credit payment, couples receiving the guaranteed income supplement will receive on average $1,500 in non-taxable direct assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514595">Our government has provided seniors with financial support during this crisis, and we will continue to support seniors and all Canadians during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514596">I would now like to set the record straight and address some of the points raised by my colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514597">In recent months, the <Affiliation DbId="252623" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> and certain members have made several misleading statements concerning the financial situation of seniors. The leader of the Bloc mentioned many times that seniors have received practically no financial support during the pandemic and that their purchasing power is shrinking.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514598">That is not true. The leader of the Bloc Québécois is playing political games and frightening seniors by spreading false information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514599">Our role is to support seniors at their most vulnerable, and we know that they are the most vulnerable during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514600">Let us set the record straight once and for all. The myth that has been spread is that we failed to take the necessary measures to protect seniors’ purchasing power. That should never happen. They claim that seniors have received practically no help at all since the beginning of the pandemic. The leader of the Bloc Québécois said that on Radio-Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514601">In fact, low-income couples received more than $1,500 in support from the Government of Canada to cover additional costs during the pandemic, thanks to a supplementary GST credit payment in April and one-time old age security and guaranteed income security payments in July.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514602">Under the law, public pensions, including old age security, the guaranteed income supplement, the Canada pension plan and the Quebec pension plan, are adjusted to protect seniors’ purchasing power against inflation. The leader of the Bloc and my colleagues know that. Old age security benefits are adjusted in January, April, July and October, and Canada pension plan and Quebec pension plan benefits are adjusted once a year. It is a matter of accounting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514603">The Bloc Québécois has also been spreading another myth, to the effect that during the pandemic, seniors’ purchasing power increased by a mere 61¢. I believe that my colleague used another number, specifically $1.38. The leader of the Bloc said that in the House of Commons on December 1, 2020. In fact, to support seniors during the pandemic, our government made tax-free payments through GST credits in March and through old age security and guaranteed income supplement payments in July. For a low-income couple, that comes out to more than $1,500. Old age security is adjusted on the basis of inflation four times a year in order to preserve seniors’ purchasing power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514604">The leader of the Bloc is deliberately misleading seniors by presenting this adjustment as support during the pandemic and making the amount seem like an insult. He is playing politics at seniors’ expense. That is why we will be voting against this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514605">Our government is determined to increase old age security by 10% for seniors aged 75 and over. We were already working on it when the pandemic hit. As seniors age, their needs increase. Our proposal for seniors 75 and up meets these needs, even if the Bloc has its own proposals. Our government’s plan will raise tens of thousands of low-income seniors out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514606">I recall that the Bloc voted against our throne speech, which included our proposal to increase old age security by 10% for seniors aged 75 and over. Today they are saying that nothing was done. Seniors have earned our respect and admiration. They deserve the best quality of life possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514636">Too many seniors and their families know first-hand that delays in vaccine procurement have a real human life cost, just as delays in procuring PPE and rapid testing hindered our ability to better protect our seniors, specifically those living in long-term care homes. The crisis in long-term care demands action and collaboration from every level of government to improve the quality of care for our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514637">The pandemic restrictions on seniors have had a significant impact on mental health. Separated and isolated from family and friends, our seniors have missed important milestones and social connections, even something as simple as sitting and holding someone’s hand. We cannot ignore the significant impact of this pandemic on their quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514638">We also know that seniors have not been immune to the financial implications of this pandemic. Seniors are facing many unanticipated costs because of the pandemic. Many are feeling the squeeze on their fixed income, and costs certainly have not decreased for our seniors during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514639">In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s own carbon tax is costing seniors more. Not only did he hike up the carbon tax during this crisis, he also made the announcement that he would be tripling it. It is a tax hike that is costing seniors more for essentials such as gas, groceries and even home heating. It is a punitive tax that is even costlier for rural seniors like those who live in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514640">The impact of COVID on Canada’s seniors is clearly immense, and for seniors who were already struggling pre-pandemic, the new challenges brought on by the pandemic have been an added layer of stress. While we know that Canada’s seniors are a very broad demographic with diverse needs and differing priorities, the reality is that too many are struggling to make ends meet, and they are slipping through the cracks. We need to do better for those seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514641">The Conservatives support increasing financial support for low-income seniors. They should not have to make a difficult decision among home heating, groceries and other necessities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514642">The proposed motion from our colleagues in the Bloc would achieve the goal of putting more money in the pockets of low-income seniors to spend on their own individual needs. However, it is important to acknowledge that the motion casts a wider net. It calls on the government to increase the old age security benefit for seniors. This benefit is delivered not only to low-income seniors, but also to higher-income seniors. The OAS benefit does not start to get clawed backed until a senior’s income threshold is around $79,000, and the benefit is only fully clawed back once a senior’s income is about $128,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514643">The proposed increase to old age security is not the most efficient use of taxpayers' dollars, if the intended goal is to support low-income seniors. That should be our driving force: getting money into the hands of those who need it the most.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514644">This is particularly important in light of the reality of the government spending billions and billions of dollars, and it has done that while failing to deliver a budget in not just one year but two. Today, Canadians are still waiting on a real plan to restart the economy and to exit this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514645">With all of that in mind, we have a responsibility to also be wise with taxpayer dollars. There need to be meaningful supports delivered to seniors whose budgets are already stretched further than they can manage. This needs to be done while also ensuring the long-term viability of our social programs. That is one reason we are disappointed to see that the motion uses old age security benefits instead of utilizing the guaranteed income supplement. With the maximum income of a single recipient at $18,648, GIS would be a much more targeted approach to improving income security for low-income seniors. This would be the most fiscally responsible approach to getting money into the hands of those seniors who need it the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514646">Ultimately, Conservatives do support ensuring that our seniors have income security. We have a proud record of putting money back into the pockets of low-income seniors and we remain committed to improving their well-being and financial security. We recognize that a dollar is better placed in the pockets of a low-income senior to spend on their individual needs and their individual priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514647"> Greater direct financial supports will help low-income seniors keep their heads above water, and having the income security to spend on their individual needs will also give seniors greater autonomy. For some seniors, that autonomy could be the difference between aging in place or moving into a care home. I think of a senior who only needs help with lawn care or shovelling the snow to be able to stay in their own home, or a senior who needs some light housekeeping help. Giving seniors greater income security and autonomy also gives them a greater quality of life and a greater dignity in living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514648">That is why Conservatives support an increase in direct financial assistance for low-income seniors. We know that too many seniors are struggling, and we call on the government to deliver meaningful support to help seniors who are struggling to make ends meet. It is the time for seniors to be a greater priority for the Liberal government. Shamefully, it has been clear that seniors have never been a priority for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is evident in the fact that it took him three years to appoint a seniors minister, and that was only done following sustained pressure from Conservatives, stakeholders and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514649">The government's failure to deliver on its election promise and its recycled throne speech promise to increase OAS also speaks to its priorities. It is yet another example of the Liberal government over-promising and under-delivering when it comes to our seniors. The government needs to move away from announcements and move toward meaningful action. Our seniors deserve to live in dignity. An announcement with no plan to deliver on it and no follow-through does nothing to put food on the table, nothing to put gas in the tank and nothing to keep the heat on. Seniors on a fixed income who are struggling to get by need more than empty words and empty promises: They need meaningful action from the Liberal government. They deserve income security. They need to be a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514650">This past year, COVID has revealed many shortcomings when it comes to support for our seniors. The pandemic has demanded that we make seniors a priority, but more important than that, our duty and our responsibility to care for our seniors demand it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514668">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate today and to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our seniors who have worked so hard to build the country that we have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514669">The current pandemic deeply affects them because the virus has serious consequences for seniors in poor health. The reason we have been able to respond to this challenge with an array of economic measures is that those before us left Canada in an enviable position. We must do more for our seniors dealing with financial hardship. Not all of them had the same opportunities in life and today, unfortunately, too many seniors are living below the poverty line. That is unacceptable in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514670">The cost of living is rising faster than seniors' incomes, forcing them to make difficult decisions, such as selling their home or valuables to make ends meet. All too often, when a spouse dies, the surviving spouse's financial circumstances change significantly. As MPs, we have all heard very compelling stories from seniors in our ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514671">I rise in the House today to point out that we can do more as a country to recognize the work that has been accomplished by our seniors. In my view, we should pay particular attention to the guaranteed income supplement, which provides seniors in precarious financial situations with a higher income than the basic guaranteed amount. The GIS is calculated based on other sources of income, and we can increase the amount of the supplement or adjust eligibility criteria to ensure a higher income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514672">That said, the Bloc Québécois is presenting us with a measure that it cannot implement on its own in this parliament or any future parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514673">Unlike the Liberals who have done nothing since being elected in 2015, we Conservatives have always acted. In 2006, our government created the position of minister of state for seniors within Employment and Social Development Canada, formerly Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. It was the Right Hon. Stephen Harper who initiated this idea. We already knew that, in 2012, nearly one in seven Canadians was a senior and that by 2030, this proportion would rise to almost one in four.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514674">I must admit that the Bloc Québécois's motion is commendable, but we must remember that it cannot do anything in the House on its own, other than proposing ideas and not following through. This is a clear example of how we are the only ones who have remained committed to improving quality of life for our dear seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514675">The Conservatives created and improved a number of measures for seniors in 22 federal departments, including the popular New Horizons program. This program helps seniors to both benefit from and contribute to the quality of life in their community through social participation and active living. It provides funding to support local projects, pan-Canadian projects and pilot projects that focus on issues like social isolation and intergenerational learning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514676">Previous Conservative governments have implemented other measures as well. In January 2012, the Conservative government starting providing direct support to people caring for a loved one with reduced mobility through the family caregiver tax credit. We were also the first to support Canadians who act as caregivers and also continue working.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514677">We recognized the important contribution that caregivers make to their family members and their community by providing support and unpaid care, quite often while dealing with their responsibilities toward other family members and keeping their job. The 2014 economic action plan helped caregivers continue to participate in the workforce as fully as possible while caring for a loved one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514678">We also made changes to employment insurance and brought in caregiver leave and benefits. Still today, these benefits may be provided for a few weeks to people who temporarily have to leave work to care for a loved one who is seriously ill or who has a significant risk of dying within 26 weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514679">The previous Conservative government brought in a home accessibility tax credit through which eligible seniors and persons with disabilities are entitled to a 15% tax relief on eligible expenses up to $10,000. To be eligible, the expenses have to be related to renovations that allow for greater mobility or functionality or reduce the risks of accident. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514680">We doubled the pension income amount. Years ago, a non-refundable tax credit was created for the first $1,000 in eligible pension income. A lot has changed since then. The previous Conservative government increased the eligible pension income amount to $2,000. To this day, that is a real savings that really helps pensioners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514681">We introduced the age amount, which allows seniors to claim up to $7,637 on their 2020 tax return.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514682">We also introduced pension income splitting to reduce the tax burden on Canadian pensioners and make the system fairer. Generally speaking, every individual pays tax on their total income. Pension income splitting allows all Canadian residents who receive eligible pension income to split up to half of that income with a spouse or common-law partner if they live together. That means pensioners and their families can pay considerably less tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514683">I am also thinking of the increase in the age limit for RRSP to RRIF conversions. The registered retirement savings plan is one of the best tools available to Canadians to save for their future. Since RRSP contributions are tax-free under the contribution limit, they are an ideal way to plan for retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514684">However, some Canadians were limited by the RRSP structure. Even if a person chose to work after the age of 69, they had to convert their RRSPs into a registered retirement income fund and start making withdrawals. The previous Conservative government increased the age limit for RRSP to RRIF conversions from 69 to 71. Now more Canadians have the freedom to choose when they want to convert their RRSPs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514685">All of these measures and many others help to grow our economy. I am still very proud of them today, and I promote them every year in a tax guide that I send to all my constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514686">We understand the consequences that a precarious financial situation can have on people's lives, especially those of the aging population. We all have a duty to be part of the solution. If we have the will to do it, we can act relatively quickly to provide financial support to our seniors in the upcoming budget, if the Liberals get their act together and introduce one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514687">In addition to the effects of the pandemic, the government has created a lot of uncertainty for our seniors and the rest of the population. If the Liberals really intended to help seniors, they would have already done so, and we all know that the Bloc Québécois can never win the Prime Minister's seat. That leaves the Conservatives as the only option for helping seniors who are in a precarious financial situation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514688">I am sure that stakeholders will realize that we stand on our record and that our good intentions will become reality in the future Conservative Government of Canada. Together, we will tackle the challenge of repairing the damage caused by the Liberals and rebuilding the Canadian economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514709"> I would like to thank my Bloc colleague for bringing this motion forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514711">For the benefit of those watching at home today, I would like to lay out what this motion actually proposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514712"> The motion calls on the present government to increase the old age security benefit, or OAS, by $110 a month for those aged 65 and older in the next budget. It asks the House of Commons:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514713">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">(a) recognize that the elderly were most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) recall that too many of the elderly live in a financially precarious position; (c) acknowledge the collective debt that we owe to those who built Quebec and Canada...</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514714">Of course the House should recognize that our seniors have borne the brunt of the effects of COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, Statistics Canada reported that 60% of our seniors aged 65 and over stated that they were extremely concerned for their health and well-being. This is in contrast to the 20 to 34 age group, wherein only 28% had the same level of concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514715">In a statement on this amplification of inequality as the result of the COVID-19 crisis, the Canadian Human Rights Commission singled out our elderly, warning that as they were likely either living in an institution or living at home alone, they were isolated during the pandemic more now than ever and had an elevated vulnerability to illness. The commission rightly pointed out that for the most part, family and friends were not allowed to visit them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514716"> When seniors do not have access to or the knowledge to use various methods of communication, we should continue to find more creative ways to reach out and support our seniors. We certainly saw that seniors, particularly in long-term care facilities, were being ravaged by the virus to an extent well beyond that of our demographics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514717">If we look at a snapshot of about two months ago of the pandemic in Canada, deaths due to COVID in long-term care facilities made up a staggering 81% of COVID deaths in the country. By comparison, the average among other countries around the globe of COVID deaths in long-term care homes was 42% of all deaths, compared to our 81%. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514718">In response, the New Democrats announced a plan to offer a seniors care guarantee. We called on the government to take steps to eliminate profit from our long-term care and work with caregivers and provincial and territorial governments to develop national care standards for long-term and continuing care and to regulate these in step with the Canadian Health Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514719">The other call to the House is to acknowledge the financial precarity of our seniors. In normal times, many seniors face high prices for rent, hydro, cable, gas and insurance as well as food, medical and pharmaceutical costs. Due to the pandemic, seniors have increased costs that they would normally not have. For example, statistics show that seniors use paid delivery services more than any other demographic during the pandemic for things like food and medicine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514720">As a result of the NDP pressure, the government finally announced a one-time payment of $300 for old age security pensioners and an additional $200 for guaranteed income supplement recipients. However, this one-off payment is not enough to compensate for the increase in the cost of living for the elderly now or in the future. The government recognized the higher costs for seniors and said that new legislation would come forward, but has since been silent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514721">COVID-19 has exposed the major gaps in our health care system and the cost of prescription drugs. A national pharmacare program is needed now more than ever. The majority of Canadians are in a support of a pharmacare program, yet the Liberals voted against our pharmacare bill yesterday. It is a matter of public record that the Liberals have been promising to implement a universal pharmacare program for more than 24 years, yet they have never acted on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514722">The final call to the House in today's motion is in regard to the contributions of our seniors to the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514723"> Seniors in Canada have made endless contributions to our families, our communities and country, and to the nature of our society. An obvious truth is that each generation is built upon the work of its seniors. For that, we should be thankful and grateful to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514724">We should be honouring our seniors by looking after them. I think we have a moral obligation to do so. Unfortunately, there remain too many signs that we are not there yet. Too often seniors do not have access to affordable housing. They must rely on food banks weekly and have to ration medication.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514725">Seniors have done their part and should be able to live out their retirement years in dignity. For that reason, the New Democrats have promoted a national seniors strategy to ensure that measures and programs are in place to meet the needs of our retired and elderly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514726">Lastly, the motion is a call for the government to increase old age security. To properly speak to the merits of raising the OAS benefit, I would like to touch first on the Canada pension plan, or CPP. It should be noted that only those Canadians who have contributed to the Canada pension plan can qualify at the age of 60 for this monthly benefit and receive benefits for the rest of their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514727">Old age security is the retirement benefit at the centre of today's motion. OAS is a universal pension that does not depend on a retiree's previous labour force participation or whether they have registered pension or savings plans. One can qualify at the age of 65. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514728">We have to remember that we need stability, and most of our private pension plans are now under attack because there is no support and no protection when companies go into bankruptcy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514729">The Conservatives, under Stephen Harper, put in a plan to raise the age of eligibility for old age security from 65 to 67. The NDP fought to end that discrimination and ensure that our seniors lived out their retirement with dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514730">The age threshold, in this motion to bump up the benefit, is 65 years of age, so all seniors who qualify would benefit from the raise. I believe it is extremely important that all seniors get the increase and not just some. The Liberals promised to increase the OAS, but only for those 75 years of age and over. I ask my Liberal colleagues this: How is it that they think seniors from age 65 to 74 do not have the same high costs, expensive bills and struggles to afford them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514731">It is beyond me why the government would establish a two-tier OAS. Either way, there has been no action. The labour community has also advocated for improvements to our retirement benefit and would support the increase to the OAS, as we do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514732">I will share a quote from Mark Hancock, national president of CUPE:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514733">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> CUPE has long supported an expansion of our public pensions, including Old Age Security. Workplace pension plans continue to face cuts and closures, and rates of poverty among seniors are increasing again. The Old Age Security pension hasn't kept pace over the years and isn’t worth what it was 40 years ago, but a boost to that benefit would restore some of that lost value and lift thousands of seniors out of poverty.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514734">In conclusion, the NDP believe that we must address the inadequacies of our public retirement supports and other supports for our seniors. As a start, we absolutely support an increase to OAS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514735">I want to conclude by saying thanks to all the members who are listening. I want to thank the Bloc again. I am hoping there will be no problems here, and that we all will support this important motion.</ParaText>

The Liberal government has failed to protect them when their companies go bankrupt and take cuts to their pensions. It said it was going to fix it and it did not. That is my answer. All people should be included at 65. There should not be a two-tier system of 75 and over.</ParaText>

I reminded him that the Conservatives wanted to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67, which was especially cruel towards low-to-no-income seniors and would have resulted in seniors forfeiting tens of thousands of dollars. The only reply we got was that it was very fortunate that this measure was never implemented. If he is pleased that the measure was never implemented, I wonder why he voted for it. I hope that everyone will remember that at the appropriate time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514750">I thank my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois for moving today's motion about this fundamental issue of how we, as MPs or parliamentarians, must look after the men and women who built our society and left us and our children an absolutely fantastic legacy that allows us to enjoy security, prosperity, justice and solidarity. Hats off to the men and women who are seniors today and who worked so hard all their lives to leave our society so well off, both in Quebec and in Canada, compared to the rest of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514751">We in the NDP, being progressives, social democrats and left-leaning men and women, are particularly concerned about all issues related directly or indirectly to the quality of our social fabric and people's quality of life. Are people able to live and grow old in dignity? Can we work together to fight poverty and inequality? Let us remember that for the NDP, poverty is a form of violence, because it is abusive to prevent people from having a comfortable home, being able to buy groceries, having hobbies and living a truly enjoyable, fulfilling life without having to make absurd, difficult choices. Sadly, too many of our seniors are still living in poverty today. There are many things that we could do to help them get out of poverty and live in dignity, because they more than deserve it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514752">Increasing the old age security benefit by $110 a month, as proposed in the motion we are debating today, is a measure that the NDP supports and has been championing for a long time. We are very proud of that, because it is a matter of justice, especially in a society as rich as ours in Quebec and Canada. It is the least we can do, but it is not the only thing. There is a lot more we can do to improve the lot of our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514753">It bears repeating that this motion comes at a critical time, in the middle of a year-long national crisis caused by COVID-19. To put it bluntly, the spread of the virus took a heavy toll on our seniors, sadly. Many lost their lives, often in unspeakable circumstances, separated from their loved ones and denied even the possibility of holding someone's hand before passing. We all have to work together to make sure this does not happen again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514754">In order to do that, we have to learn from the current crisis. In our view, two major lessons stand out. First, we saw how important it is to have a strong and efficient public health care system that treats its workers, and therefore our seniors, well. The working conditions of our health care workers directly affect the quality of the care that seniors receive. Second, there are holes in our social safety net, and the shortcomings of the old age security program are just one of many examples.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514755">However, there are several such holes. It is important to address all of them, but for us, it is really important that we reinforce our health care system. The NDP is suggesting a number of measures that need to be implemented. First, health transfers must be increased. The federal contribution in this area is really declining and is now almost anemic. We agree with the provincial premiers that transfers should be increased to at least 35%. The federal share of health transfers has a direct impact on the working conditions of our health care professionals, as well as the quality of care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514756">Speaking of quality of care, the federal and provincial governments need to enter into discussions to guarantee care for our seniors, especially in long-term care facilities, which have sadly been absolutely devastated this past year. We cannot afford to look away when our seniors are being mistreated. We need to sit down together, discuss the matter and find solutions. The federal government cannot wash its hands of the issue. Government members need to ask themselves what they can do to improve the situation and prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514757">Also, the private sector should not be in charge of senior care, especially in long-term care facilities. We must agree on the fact that this is a fundamental value in our society, and that money should not be the deciding factor in whether a person receives quality care. Everyone is equal. In addition, no profit should be made on senior care because, obviously, in such cases, there is a tendency to do things by half measures and to prioritize shareholders over seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514758">I spoke about the pandemic and long-term care facilities, but I also want to mention all of the seniors who are active in our communities. As members of Parliament, we must help them, provide support and stand with them. Some older people are very active. They volunteer and are engaged in the community. They want to create a better society. Some of them help children with their homework, and others help solve environmental issues. There are also the people at FADOQ, who do an extraordinary job defending seniors' rights, among others, in Quebec. I commend them for their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514759">The pandemic has also been very difficult for active and autonomous seniors. They have been unable to see their families and grandchildren. They are isolated. Many of them suffered from isolation before the pandemic, and the situation has only gotten worse. Community groups have been formed in Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie and here and there in Montreal and Quebec. People are urged to look in on seniors who were already known to be alone or isolated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514760">I have gone with some groups, including the La Petite-Patrie community resource centre, to bring baskets of food to seniors to avoid them having to go out to buy groceries. We have organized things and joined forces to give seniors a hand. I think that needs to be acknowledged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514761">Seniors often live on a fixed income. That is why it is so important to enhance the guaranteed income supplement and old age security, and why we must support this motion to increase old age security by $110 a month. Prices are going up. The cost of groceries is increasing. Despite the fact that seniors live on a fixed income, the price of produce, meat and other groceries is constantly on the rise. Studies have shown that prices will increase by 3% to 5% over the next year. For a family, that could mean an additional $700 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514762">As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252904" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> put it, by pressuring the government, we managed to get one-time assistance, but that is not enough. We want permanent assistance to help seniors get out of poverty and face higher costs, in particular when it comes to groceries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514763">As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> pointed out, there is a sharp increase in the cost of drugs also, which is a very heavy burden for many seniors. That is why I am scratching my head and wondering why the Bloc, the Liberals and the Conservatives teamed up against our proposal to create a universal public pharmacare program. Such a program would have the very tangible effect of lowering the cost of drugs. It could go forward. Liberals have been talking about it for 24 years, but they never do anything. Each time they have an opportunity to vote on that proposal, they choose to vote against it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514764">I have a hard time understanding why my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois did not vote in favour of that measure, which a large part of the Quebec society is calling for. A wide coalition including all major unions—the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec, or FTQ, the Confédération des syndicats nationaux, or CSN, la Centrale des syndicats du Québec, or CSQ, as well as the Union des consommateurs du Québec—has been asking for action, in collaboration with provinces. They want truly universal public pharmacare. That is one of the things we could do to help seniors directly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514767">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Trois-Rivières for her question, because it is particularly relevant. It is something we are currently facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514768">Many seniors are alone and live on a single income. Most of them are women. The vast majority of these women did not have steady jobs or jobs with supplementary pension plans when they were younger. That means that they do not have a supplemental source of income from a pension plan to which they would have contributed through their employer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514769">More men had the opportunity to do so. Of course, this is because of sexism in the workplace and in the assignment of tasks in the past. It still exists, but it was perhaps more marked at the time. Unfortunately, all too often, a woman's only income comes from existing programs. If they do not have a supplementary pension plan, they also probably did not contribute to the Quebec pension plan consistently over a number of years. They have only their old age security, or maybe the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514770">Poverty among seniors exists but, for social and historical reasons, it affects women more than men. That is why we must fight for pension plans everywhere, in every business, in every company, so that tomorrow, or the day after that, women do not find themselves in the same situation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514773">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Edmonton Strathcona for her excellent comments concerning the need for a universal public pharmacare program that would make such a difference for our seniors, especially when it comes to the accessibility and cost of medications. Everyone would benefit. Unfortunately, yesterday, three parties joined forces against the NDP's proposal, which would have met such pressing needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514774">I believe that the private sector has no place in long-term care facilities. As we saw yesterday, the Liberals often bow down to large private companies. Yesterday, it was big pharma, and we get the impression that they do not really want to bow down to large private companies when it comes to senior care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514775">We should not distinguish between credit cards and health insurance cards. Health insurance cards should give us access to quality care, and I think that we should all work together and figure out a way of avoiding such situations in the future.</ParaText>

It is disgraceful and unacceptable in our society, and we, at every level of government, must do everything we can to work together to make sure that it does not happen again. The private sector has no place in health care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514777">Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention that I will be sharing my time with my esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252552" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514778">I will start my speech on a serious note. I heard several people today talking about their party's achievements and saying that we, as an opposition party, are useless. They sound like they are in the middle of an election campaign. We are not in the middle of an election campaign and, today, we are talking about seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514779">I find it revolting that we have not taken decent care of our seniors in the past. It makes no sense. Which reminds me, I need to think before I speak to avoid using unparliamentary language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514780">In today's motion, our party proposes that the House “recognize that the elderly were most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic”. Seniors were the most directly affected, and the ones who received the least support. How does that make sense?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514781">People think that seniors were not affected, but many of them work part-time because they are not making enough money. Others lost their sources of income, which were based on long-term investments or savings that have not paid out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514782">Now that I have spoken about savings, I will speak about income. We must realize that most seniors live on a fixed income, in other words, pension benefits that are either barely indexed or not indexed at all. Consider the ridiculous maximum increase of $1.52 a month for those receiving the maximum amount this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514783">Fixed incomes cannot absorb inflation as prices continue to rise. The rent increase is estimated at 4% this year. Food prices will likely rise because of shortages in the farming industry and the fact that farmers are not getting much support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514784">Consider, too, delivery fees that seniors did not have to pay before and the “COVID-19 fees” some merchants are charging, often out of necessity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514785">Isolated people are most at risk. Let us not forget that the majority of deaths occurred among seniors. These people are not only more at risk, but live with more fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514786">What did we do to help them? Not much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514787">Our motion also asks the House to “recall that too many of the elderly live in a financially precarious position”. I could quote statistics about the basket of consumer goods and services, but there is a very simple way to understand that the monthly amount of $1,500 is utter nonsense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514788">When Canada found itself in a state of emergency and the government decided to grant a minimum amount to all those who lost their jobs or were unable to work because of the spread of the virus, we all know what the government decided to give them: $2,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514789">That is not what we are asking for today. What we are asking for is an additional $110 for seniors. In 1975, old age security was 20% of the average industrial wage. Today, it is 13%. We have allowed this support measure to quietly peter out, bit by bit. Why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514790">Is it because we take seniors for granted? Is it because their voices are not strong enough to be heard? Is it because they don't have any friends in this government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514791">The government promised hand on heart, as usual, to help them. After pressuring the government again and again, we finally obtained a one-time payment of $300 for every senior, with an extra $200 for those who receive the guaranteed income supplement. Seniors were also granted a one-time GST and HST credit payment, and that is it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514792">Financial insecurity for seniors is not a one-time problem that can be addressed by a one-time payment. It requires a basic benefit increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514793">I will go back to a word I frequently use when standing up for the agriculture sector: predictability. Seniors need predictability to pay their bills, have a budget and not feel anxious at the end of the month because they do not know if they will have enough money left to eat properly. We are not saying that seniors will run out and buy new cars next week; we are talking about $110 a month.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514794">Let us consider the obscene amounts this country spends on the British Crown. I will not open up that can of worms, and I will not waste time detailing the shameful amounts we give the Crown, but let us think about what $110 a month could do for seniors living at home. I think that is very reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514795">The problem has existed for a long time. It existed before the pandemic. The people at FADOQ are asking for stability and predictability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514796">The third part of our motion acknowledges the collective debt that we owe to those who built Quebec and Canada. On March 8, my father will turn 86. I do not want to get emotional, but I would like you to know that he was a lumberjack at 12 years old. How many of us could have done that? He did not have access to education, either. However, the work done by his generation created these opportunities for future generations. Thanks to my father’s generation, Quebec is a better place. Do we not have the moral obligation to provide this generation with decent care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514797">Fortunately, my father had a good job and a good pension plan, and his finances are a lot easier to manage. However, I keep thinking of those who do not have any money. Every time my father has a major expense, I think how terrible it must be for those who cannot pay for a walker, a wheelchair or home adaptations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514798">I will stop here, because I am going to get even more emotional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514799">The fourth part of our motion asks the government, in the next budget, to increase the old age security benefit by $110 a month for those aged 65 and more. I hope that no one in the Conservative Party will say that I cannot do anything for seniors, when they fully intended to increase the retirement age to 67. I await their questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514800">Our party is also proposing simple solutions, such as automatic income tax returns for people whose situation does not change. Can we help them instead of making it more difficult and making them fill out 28 forms? People are disadvantaged, and even more so during the pandemic. They are afraid to go out, or simply cannot go out. The community services that usually help them fill out their income tax returns are underfunded and not operating right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514801">How about paying a deceased person's pension benefits to a spouse for three months after that person's death? I clearly remember having to repay my mother's benefits after she died. What a way to express condolences. Frankly, I think our society can do better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514802">We would like to see a tax credit for home adaptations that people can get once the work is done. I could share my own story about this. It can take up to a year for a subsidy to be approved, and people cannot always wait that long before adapting their homes. Sometimes they need it right away. How about making things easy and providing an automatic tax credit for home care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514803">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252552" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation>, who will be speaking next, has repeatedly proposed a bill to protect workers' pension plans when businesses go bankrupt. If we are talking about OAS, we also have to talk about protecting pension plans. That is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514804">We are asking for a minimum token increase of $110 per month. The Liberals intend to spend $100 billion on their recovery plan, but they do not have the willingness or decency to increase old age pensions by $110 a month. I will refrain from saying what I am really thinking and simply say that I find that appalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514805">The government is preparing to spend $100 billion. What will people with incomes of $1,500 a month do with that additional $110? Does the government think that they will put it in a savings account or keep it for later? No. They are going to spend it and help keep the economy running. That is what we need. We need to kick-start the economy. Let us give them the boost they need. The population is aging. This makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514806">I appeal to members of the House. Let us look beyond political partisanship. In the debate earlier, some were saying that the Bloc Québécois voted in favour of this or against that. Yesterday, the Bloc Québécois also voted in favour of a bill that does not affect Quebec because it was a sensible measure. We use good judgment. I do not have time to talk about all of the reasons why we voted for that bill right now, but I would like members to ask me about it later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514807">In the meantime, let us adopt this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514820">Mr. Speaker, many seniors are having a tough time in my riding. During COVID, it has been exacerbated, but in general, even before that, the number one issue was seniors falling behind. I mentioned before that one thing we definitely need to do is increase the help for seniors so they can get by. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514821">However, another big part of it is finding ways to decrease the cost of the things they do, such as going to buy groceries, or going to the doctor or on any other trips. When costs increase because of something like a carbon tax, that applies to all products. That really needs to be said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514822">I am wondering what the thought process is, and if the member opposite thinks we should find ways to not increase things, such as the carbon tax, which make it more difficult for seniors to live day to day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514824">My colleague is talking about two different problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514825">Personally, I think we can provide adequate support to our seniors. There are some cost increases that we simply cannot control. For instance, we will not control the private market or indexing. However, one thing we can control is old age security. That is an important element. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514826">As for the carbon tax, the Bloc has a very balanced position. We believe that pollution should definitely cost something, since this will help encourage the transition. However, this must happen when the transition is possible. There must be alternative options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514827">That is why we supported a private member's bill yesterday that tackles that very issue. Very few alternatives exist at this time. We must act intelligently so as not to increase food costs. However, the general principle will always remain: We want to protect the environment and take care of our seniors adequately. Meanwhile, we also have the duty and the important responsibility of leaving the planet in decent shape for our children. We are the sandwich generation. We are privileged, but we need to take care of those who came before us, while not forgetting to think about what we are leaving to those who come after us. This is fundamental.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514828">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253051" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> for his speech. We could feel his emotion, but also his indignation, which I share. I have always said that I got into politics because I have a capacity for indignation, which I want to be constructive, of course. That is why I really understand the situation when we talk about how seniors are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514829">I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> for making a very good speech and for being behind this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514830">While I was listening to the news over the past few days, I heard a journalist ask a senior at what point one no longer counts. Regardless of where that came from, I must say that the question really surprised me and made me angry about the very issue of seniors, because we are letting such a dangerous discourse spread unchecked out there in society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514831">I have to say that I heard that on the national broadcaster, where I once heard a very serious discussion on the possibility of taking away seniors' right to vote at some point. These may not be major ideas, but those ideas are being floated nonetheless. That gravely worries me. I must say that a motion like the one being moved today, which “acknowledge[s] the collective debt that we owe” to seniors, must be taken seriously. There are good reasons for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514832">I think that societal discourse is sometimes dismissive of seniors, when in fact they are an integral part of our society. Earlier I heard comments about age. Members talked about “starting at age 75”, “from age 65 to 67”, “after 67 years of age”, and so on. We have to work with that sort of breakdown, to some degree, to make things easier, but at the same time we must never forget that seniors are an integral part of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514833">I think we should follow the example of the first nations. I say this humbly, as the member of Parliament for Manicouagan, where the Inuit and the Naskapi peoples make up 15% of the population. As demographics change, these communities will become larger and larger. The way the first nations treat seniors is the polar opposite of what I have heard on Radio-Canada. First nations elders are served first at community meetings. They will have first choice of cuts of meat, such as caribou meat. That is a bigger deal than I make it sound. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514834">These seniors are seen as assets in their communities and not as liabilities, as is the case here, as the government gives benefits to everyone except seniors during the pandemic. This shows that seniors are still being put in a separate class. In the first nations, seniors are seen as wise elders, memory keepers and knowledge keepers. I do not want to speak for the first nations, but elders are the most important members of their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514835">As a member of Parliament, a Quebecker and a human being, I am learning a great deal and I appreciate how the first nations see their seniors and their role in society. We should view seniors the same way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514836">Beyond these points and this lesson in humanity, which I wanted to talk about, I will say that my colleagues have made a number of suggestions that should be implemented for our seniors. I would like to mention them again.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514837">There is a major issue that the Bloc Québécois has rallied behind for a long time, particularly during the last year and a half, and that is health transfers. It is the federal government's job to increase health transfers to help seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514838">During the pandemic, we have talked a lot about access to vaccines. I represent a huge riding with an area of 350,000 square kilometres. People often have to travel in the riding, and because of the distances seniors have a number of needs. We need more services and more local services. The request for more health transfers is especially pertinent to seniors. That is one of our demands. Naturally, we have been repeating this since this morning, and we hope that the government will make it happen. The government must agree to increase old age security by $110 a month and it cannot be just a one-time increase. As several members have said, this must be recurring direct assistance. This assistance must not be provided solely during the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding shortfall was there well before the pandemic. That is what the Bloc Québécois is asking for, in addition to an increase in the guaranteed income supplement of $50 to $70, depending on whether the recipient is single or married. This assistance will help support seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514839">Due to the costs incurred by seniors during the pandemic and at the present time, their purchasing power is constantly getting lower. As I mentioned, there was already a shortfall before the pandemic, and it is now a huge gap. This must be addressed quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514840">The Bloc Québécois motion is a call for action, and I hope the government will answer the call. In the 2019 and 2020 throne speeches, the government said it would help seniors. It has been saying that for a year and a half. Earlier, I heard the <Affiliation DbId="253798" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Seniors</Affiliation> talk about the New Horizons for Seniors program and several other measures that may be beneficial, but that do not provide seniors with any immediate assistance or give them the freedom to choose for themselves. There is a huge difference between the New Horizons for Sseniors program, which is a useful program, and having money put directly in their pockets. It is important to understand that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514841">I hope that the parliamentary secretary and the minister heard what we had to say on this topic. I hope they will adopt the Bloc Québécois motion in order to demonstrate swift and meaningful support for our seniors. Seniors must not be left out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514842">I referred to a daily shortfall because the old age security pension is too low. The pandemic is making life even more difficult for seniors, so it is all the more urgent to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514843">I would like to conclude by encouraging the House to vote for another bill, which I tabled last November. I am talking about Bill <Document DbId="10971487" Type="4">C-253</Document>, which we will very likely debate in the spring. It is also aimed at helping seniors and retirees. When companies restructure or go bankrupt, retirement funds are cut, leading to disaster, devastation and tragedy. Group insurance plans are also cancelled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514844">Seniors themselves keep saying that what they want is stability and predictability. By protecting the deferred wages that seniors have earned and deserve, the government would be protecting their rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514845">I will conclude by adding that it is also important to protect seniors' dignity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514868">Let us go back to 2010, and I could probably even go further back. I can recall being involved in a public meeting. It was a great atmosphere. There were a number of seniors present. I talked about the contributions people had made and cited those who were in the room with me. These were the people who built what we have today, in part, in the north end of Winnipeg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514869">When we talk about seniors in general, we often hear about how great they are. Then we continue on to other aspects. I do believe it is important to recognize that this wonderful, beautiful country that we all love today, Canada, including the provinces and territories within, is here because of the people who came before us and the many different efforts of seniors then and today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514870">Just because someone might be in a long-term care facility, it does not mean that they are not contributing to our economy or to our society. I think of grandparents who are passing on knowledge or wisdom, whatever one might want to call it, to a grandchild or a great-grandchild. Generally speaking, from birth to death, there is a contribution that can be made to our society, and all people need to be treated equally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514871"> I know I share this belief with my colleagues in the Liberal caucus. We understand the importance of seniors. In fact, we have a seniors caucus group that spends a tremendous amount of time on the issue of seniors and how we, as a government, can provide the types of supports that seniors need and deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514872">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, even before he was Prime Minister, talked a great deal about how we need to be there to support Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it, but also recognizing the important role that our seniors have played in society and continue to play in society. In fact, I would suggest that members look at the actions this Liberal government has taken over the last number of years and the results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514873">When we talk about combatting poverty and look at seniors who are in poverty, through the policies we have put in place, we have reduced that number by 25%. That is 25% fewer seniors living in poverty today than back in 2015. This is in good part through the initiatives taken by the national government led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514874"> As an example, one of the government's first actions was to substantially increase the guaranteed income supplement for our seniors. That is something Liberal members from coast to coast to coast advocated for, and we put into place literally months after winning the 2015 election. The impact that had on society is immeasurable. Quite frankly, even in my riding of Winnipeg North, hundreds of seniors were taken out of poverty, or were assisted out of poverty, because of that one initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514875">Someone made reference to what seniors do with the money. They spend that money. If the poorest seniors we have in Canada are given a dollar, they will spend that dollar. They are not spending it on trips. They usually spend it on the essentials, whether it is food or medication. I will get to pharmacare a little later.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514876">The bottom line is that right from the get-go, we have had a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a government that have recognized the importance of our seniors and those who are going to be seniors too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514877">We looked at CPP reforms. Stephen Harper, the former prime minister, did absolutely nothing on that front for 10 years. Prior to being prime minister, he was part of an advocacy group that would like to have seen the demise of the CPP. At the end of the day, we were able to bring provinces, territories and stakeholders together and see increases in the CPP. That is going to assist workers in the future in their retirement. Whether it is for those who are 55 plus today or 55 plus in the years ahead, we have demonstrated that we are prepared to do whatever we can to improve their living conditions in a very real way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514878">I find it interesting that the Bloc tried to distort this last fall. Members will recall that the Bloc was trying to give the impression that seniors had not been given anything during the pandemic. The Bloc said there was just minor increase only, that that was it, because we did not care for seniors. The Bloc was trying to mislead Canadians, particularly in the province of Quebec, about what the reality actually is. That was the behaviour we saw from the leader of the Bloc. Nothing could be further from the truth because we provided one-time payments to seniors. In fact, we even enhanced that payment for those who were collecting the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514879">Did that stop the Bloc from spreading misinformation? No, it did not. We now have a Bloc motion saying that we should give $110 to every senior and everyone who is over the age of 65. I suspect the Bloc sees it more as an election tool, as something it could use for propaganda. This is not something we are concerned about today only; we have been concerned about this since 2015 and have been effectively addressing that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514880">It is interesting. Think of the motion the Bloc wants us to vote in favour of and the fact that it also voted against the throne speech, which talked about giving a 10% increase to seniors over 75. To try to give an impression that a senior who is 75 is no different from a senior who is 65 is just wrong. There are more opportunities for seniors who are 65 to 75 than there are for seniors who are 75. If we had an unlimited pot of money, why would we give just $110; maybe it could be $510. I am somewhat surprised that my NDP colleagues have not already upped the $110 to some other number. It is easy to say what they are saying, but it is another thing to actually do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514881">I have listened to the Conservatives being critical of the government on this particular file. Some might suggest there is a lot of hypocrisy there. When I was in opposition and Stephen Harper was the prime minister, and some of my colleagues were in opposition longer than I was, they asked what he was doing for seniors. One member said that the Conservatives created the minister for seniors. That is true, yes, but did that result in anything tangible? Not at all, especially if we draw a comparison with what the Liberals have been able to do in less than half the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514882">During that trying time of the COVID pandemic, we even stepped up more because there are different ways we can help seniors or those who are 55 plus. I was saying that even before my 59th birthday. I can tell members that whether directly or indirectly, this is a government that has worked with the different stakeholders and different levels of government, talking about how we can bring in the types of supports that are necessary for our seniors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514883">I believe that we have been very successful in providing those supports. Does that mean there are absolutely no issues out there, that every senior is happy and that there are no problems? No, I am not trying to say that at all, but I am saying that anyone who is trying to give the false impression that this is a government that has not been proactive on this file is misleading Canadians, because we can clearly demonstrate by facts that this government has been there for seniors, virtually from day one, let alone during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514884">We talk a great deal about long-term care, and one of the reasons we have been talking about long-term care is that during the pandemic we have heard a lot about the long-term care system and many of its deficiencies. It was not that long ago that we asked the Canadian Forces to get engaged in provinces like Quebec and Ontario. My own province of Manitoba required the Canadian Red Cross to get involved, and it was all supported by the national government. Is there any surprise that Canadians are genuinely concerned? We can talk about the deaths as a direct result of the coronavirus and what percentages of deaths have occurred where. I represent the Maples Long Term Care Home in Winnipeg North. There were far too many seniors who passed away as a direct result, and I was glad that the Red Cross was able to go there and be a part of the solution, as an agency that is supported by the national government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514885">Those members of the Bloc and the Conservative Party are wrong, in my opinion, when they try to say that the federal government has no role to play. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made it very clear that through this pandemic we can learn a lot and can build back better. Unlike the Conservatives and the Bloc, Liberal members of Parliament are prepared to look at ways in which we can do just that, to build back better. I believe that the long-term care facilities are a good example of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514886">I respect jurisdictional responsibilities. I understand the lead role that provinces and territories play in health care delivery. Many years ago I was the health care critic in the province of Manitoba and asked the provincial minister of health many different questions. I sat for hours of health estimates at committees, so I understand the jurisdiction, but I also understand what my constituents want and the expectation that a national government has and should live up to. I am not going to bow to the Bloc or the Conservatives who say that we should just give the provinces money. I think that is a cowardly way of protecting the interests of our seniors from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514887">I believe that we need to look at ways we can work with those who are willing to have national standards. That is something we learned from this process. When we talk about impacts on seniors, it is not only today. I have knocked on many doors in Winnipeg North, where a senior will tell me that they have a choice to make between getting their medications or proper food. Do members know how people actually leave a hospital? They can imagine they are in a hospital, and as long as they are in the hospital they are given the prescribed medicines. When they leave the hospital, some of them are no longer getting their prescriptions, because they cannot afford them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514888">Think of the consequences of that. On the one hand, the Conservatives and the Bloc say they do not want Ottawa involved in this because Ottawa has nothing to do with it. A majority of the constituents that I represent and, I believe, a majority of Canadians, based on what I hear from my colleagues within the Liberal caucus, are behind a national pharmacare program. Liberal members of Parliament are behind a national pharmacare program because they see the benefits of it and understand what our constituents are telling us. That is why the NDP bill yesterday was hogwash. It is not as if we can pass a bill and then we have the program. It is just not reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514889">If we want to have a national pharmacare program that will be there to support our seniors, read what the throne speech said. We need to work with the provinces and territories. In order to have the very best optimal national pharmacare program, we have to work with the provinces and territories. To try to bring in legislation mandating it before any sort of real discussions take place is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514890">I know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> feels very passionately about the need to address medication coverage for all Canadians. That issue is very important to me and my colleagues, because we recognize what Canadians are saying. When we look at the benefits, we should refer to groups or associations that indirectly also play a role. During the pandemic, for example, we invested close to half a billion dollars in essential services and supplies. New Horizons For Seniors, a program for community-based projects, got $20 million. We allocated $350 million to non-profit charities. What about United Way Canada? Almost $10 million was allocated. We understand that many seniors turned to food banks and local food organizations. During the pandemic, close to $100 million was allocated to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514891">Those are all monies that have been put in place because we know that those organizations have the capability of doing so much to support seniors. Whether it is a direct contribution or an indirect tax break or a third-party organization, by working with interested stakeholders and other levels of government in many ways, we have been very successful in being there for seniors during this pandemic from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514892">I recognize that not every senior is going to be happy or has received what we would like to have provided. There is always room to improve. Improvement is something that we as a government have been very much open to and have encouraged, just as our caucus is constantly reminded to listen to our constituents and bring back their thoughts and ideas to Ottawa. We take all of that very seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514893"> I will leave it at that. We will continue to be there for our seniors in the days, weeks, months and, hopefully, years ahead.</ParaText>

He is saying that the Conservatives did nothing when they were in power and that the NDP is always asking for too much, and now all of a sudden, the Bloc Québécois is spreading misinformation. He says we are out in left field, when we are simply trying to get the government to recognize that seniors are living in precarious situations, which makes no sense, and that they definitely deserve to be treated better, including a decent increase in old age security. The Liberals see that as excessive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514896">On top of that, the parliamentary secretary is accusing the Bloc Québécois leader of misinforming the public by saying that the government is not treating seniors properly. Without the Bloc, I am not sure that the Liberals would have actually agreed, near the beginning of the pandemic, to give seniors the meagre $300 a month. Quite frankly, $300 a month for seniors is paltry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514898">The increase for seniors in 2020 that he is bragging about gives seniors a net amount of $1.52 a month. Can he look seniors in the eye and tell them that his government did right by them? </ParaText>

What I meant by that is that our “old” folks have thicker skin than today's youngsters. They are made of sterner stuff, and they are proud. They are also quite ticked off, to remain within the realm of parliamentary language; I could have chosen a much stronger word. Even though they are as generous, available and active as they possibly can, they feel like what they get in return is not gratitude, only contempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514931">In a way, that is what the motion from my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>, is all about: recognizing the precarious situation that seniors are in and fixing it. We owe them that; they built our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514932">Earlier, the <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> asked my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252552" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> how many people would benefit from the $110 monthly increase. The answer is in fact that we will all benefit. The whole society will because, in the secretary's own words, none of the money that we give to seniors will end up in a savings account. Seniors will spend that money, reinvesting it in our society. Collectively, we will benefit from treating our seniors better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514933">If we want to look a bit closer at figures and give people an idea of how many people could benefit from the increase, I would say that 20 years ago, 13% of the Quebec population was 65 years of age or older. Today, it is estimated that the ratio is around 20%, and it keeps increasing. Five years from now, in 2026, it could reach around 24 or 25%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514934">Another shocking statistic is that in 2015, 50% of seniors had incomes so low that they were exempt from paying income tax. That figure was 20% in 1997. This means that, between 1997 and 2015, there was a 30% increase in the number of seniors whose income is too low to pay income tax. That gives you an idea of the number of people who will directly benefit from the Bloc's proposed increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514935">Life expectancies have been increasing for quite some time now, and needs will only continue to grow as well; those are established facts. The most irresponsible thing we could do right now is not to invest in the quality of life of our seniors. Health care is expensive and these costs will continue to rise. We would have to be pretty out of touch with reality to stand around and do nothing. Needs are evolving, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252976" Type="2">Longueuil—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation> can confirm, and there is a need for more social housing and for more services that meet the needs of seniors, especially in health care centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514936">I want to talk a bit about seniors' buying power. It is important because that is what this debate is all about. I also want to mention the Institut de recherche et d'informations socioéconomiques, or IRIS, who did a study a few years ago. The fairly recent data from that 2018 study show that single seniors aged 65 and up living in Montreal and whose sole income is derived from the public pension system fall considerably short of what could be considered a dignified retirement. According to the IRIS, the annual revenue threshold to ensure a basic level of comfort ranges from $21,000 to $28,000, depending on the city. We are not talking about a lavish lifestyle, merely a tiny step above the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514937">In 1975, the old age security benefit represented 20% of the average industrial wage. Today, is it only 13%. This might be viewed as a positive sign in a way, because it means that wages have gone up. That may be right, but it also has a downside, because workers' buying power also increased, as did the cost of living. Seniors are left behind with their insufficient pension benefits, and we see the results today. Their pension is no longer enough to keep them out of poverty and free of debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514938">Nowadays we use the market basket measure. The estimated annual revenue required in 2021 for Montreal residents to meet their basic needs like shelter, food and clothing is $18,821. By adding together pension benefits, tax credits and the guaranteed income supplement, pensioners will receive about $18,380.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6514939">These seniors are far from being able to spend money on entertainment, play bingo or go out to a restaurant from time to time. What is probably the most heartbreaking is that they are far from being able to spoil their grandchildren a little, something that every senior wants to be able to do in the autumn of their life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514940">I will say it again. By failing to invest in seniors, we are depriving ourselves of a great asset. These people may be retired but that does not mean that they are not full of ideas, projects, goodwill and, often, energy. What is more, they are an extraordinary source of knowledge that could benefit the younger generation that spends 18 hours a day glued to a screen. Our seniors are an extraordinary source of potential, as long as we keep them in good health, as long as we keep them in a position where they can contribute to society and as long as we ensure that they have a decent standard of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514941">I want to give members an idea of what I have seen and experienced in my riding of Drummond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514942">Investing in our seniors means that we have more people like Réjeanne Comeau, who along with her friends at FADOQ, found a way to organize a massive blood drive in Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil two weeks ago in the midst of a pandemic. It was a big success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514943">Francine Leroux from Saint-Lucien is an extraordinary woman. Her project to build a space for the Cercle des fermières in her community is nearing completion. This space will benefit the entire region. Community kitchens and activities to end isolation will be held there. This is a fantastic group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514944">I am also thinking of Francine Julien, who is working hard to improve the lives of seniors in Saint-Guillaume, and Marie-France Roberge of Brin de bonheur, who organizes activities to help senior women in Drummondville feel less isolated. The organization is doing such a great job that it has to turn people away because its space is too small.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514945">I would be remiss if I did not mention Jean-Guy Moreau, who has made it his mission to help people 70 and up get moving by organizing pickleball leagues. Mr. Moreau is deeply committed to seniors. He is actually the son-in-law of James Price, whose 100th birthday I brought to the House's attention in December. I should also mention that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252533" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation> joined me for the occasion because Mr. Price is a native of Louisbourg, which is in his riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514946">In short, the Liberal government sees the Bloc Québécois's proposal to increase monthly OAS payments by $110 as an unnecessary expense. The Bloc, in contrast, sees it as an investment. As members have said, the Liberals have not yet kept their promise to increase the OAS by 10% for those 75 and up, and we do not know if they ever will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514947">As a society, we owe a debt to our seniors. This is not a frivolous thing. The bare minimum the government needs to do is ensure quality health care by increasing health transfers to the provinces and Quebec, as they have asked, and increasing the OAS for the people who built Quebec and Canada. This is about respect. We owe them respect, and I hope the House will adopt this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6514955">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government's response to COVID-19 has been and remains incoherent, constantly changing and without a publicly shared plan. This failed response is due to the government choosing to ignore the basic principles of emergency management that are normally used during pandemics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514956">Canada's emergency management experts, who were unexplainably muted during this pandemic, have clear prewritten response plans based on hard-learned lessons from previous pandemics. These plans would have allowed leaders to rapidly minimize the impacts on our society, advise the public of the scope of the hazard and publicly issue a complete written plan to address it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514957">This failure to follow emergency management guidelines is resulting in massive collateral damage to our social fabrics, mental health and other health conditions, our children, our economy, and our civil liberties. Lockdowns and restrictions are short-term, not continuous, solutions to give the government time to get permanent solutions such as vaccines and rapid testing in place. Canadians are demanding to see the Liberal plan to end this perpetual pandemic.</ParaText>

He was known for his infectious smile and his willingness to help, a willingness that went way beyond his profession. He was a community worker, an entrepreneur and philanthropist. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514985">Among his many notable achievements, Dr. Portugal advocated for Filipino caregivers in the 1980s. He was the former vice-president of the Filipino Centre Toronto and most recently founded CARP, which organizes medical professionals to bring health as well as dental care to those in need in the Philippines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6514986">Toronto Centre has lost a legend who will be greatly missed by family, friends, patients and staff, but his legacy lives on. We thank Dr. Portugal for serving us so well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515207">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today in the House to speak to this motion from the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515208">I am proud that my party is using one of its opposition days to talk about seniors and the precarious financial situations they live in. By putting this issue on today's agenda, we are giving all parliamentarians a chance to wake up to this issue, since some do not seem to be aware of it, and share their thoughts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515209">The Bloc Québécois is calling on the House to recognize that seniors have been most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to recall that too many seniors are living in a financially precarious position, and to acknowledge the collective debt that we owe those who built Quebec and Canada. We are asking the government, in the next budget, to increase the old age security benefit by $110 a month for those aged 65 and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515210">You will therefore understand how proud I am to participate in the debate about seniors. I will perhaps speak about more familiar issues to help Canadians and parliamentarians better understand the reality of seniors aged 65 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515211">After listening to various speeches, I am very surprised to see that my colleagues opposite are making a distinction between someone who is 65 and someone who is 75. Those 65 and older all have the same needs and responsibilities. They need decent and suitable housing, they must be able to buy groceries, they must be able to eat fruits and vegetables and meat or, if they are vegetarian, pulses and tofu, they must be able to pay their electrical and Internet bills, and they must be able to pay for their medications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515212">What we see, and I believe everyone here must have noticed this, is that over the past few years, and especially this past year, the cost of living has increased substantially, as shown by the grocery bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515213">According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, whether they are 65 or 75, people need to be able to house and feed themselves. Our seniors' financial means must be increased to reflect the new cost of living. It is not okay for absolutely everything to increase except for our seniors' old age security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515214">If we do a quick calculation, those receiving the guaranteed income supplement and old age security get about $1,500 a month. Whether I am 65 or 75, these two combined sources of income provide just $18,600 a year to live on. What can I buy with that? What is happening right now?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515215">Quebec seniors want to stay in their homes as long as possible. To be able to stay in my home as long as possible, I need services and support from my community, community groups, volunteers, family, caregivers and friends, but also from CLSCs. This is what our seniors want more than anything, and some even want to die at home. This requires doctors and nurses who will be able to support our seniors throughout their lives at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515216">However, people who can no longer stay at home because they need too much care must find a place to live where they can be cared for and provided with the services they need. In Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, to find a place to live that can provide the kind of services needed when one is sick or losing their autonomy, no private assisted-living residence can offer these services for less than $1,000 per month. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515217">On top of that, while this includes basic meals, it does not necessarily include any services. You could easily spend up to $1,500 or $2,000 a month to get your medication and meals and to have your room serviced. We can see very clearly right away, by my rather simple calculation, that expenses exceed the $1,500 per month that seniors receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515218">It might be a bit of an occupational hazard, but I am very concerned about the most vulnerable, people who have worked hard their entire lives but have not had the good fortune or the privilege of being unionized or having a collective agreement that includes pension income. Those who were fortunate enough to contribute to a private pension fund were able to benefit, once they retired, not only from old age security, but also from those savings. However, that is not the situation for many seniors in Quebec. Most of them have to live solely on their pension and the guaranteed income supplement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515219">As a member of Parliament, every week, I am contacted by seniors who tell me how difficult it is to make ends meet these days, and how they have to make some difficult choices. They know they need certain services, but they cannot afford them. As an MP, I assure them that the Bloc Québécois supports them completely, and I promise to be their voice in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515220">That is why I wanted to rise today. I wanted to point out that these people are falling through the cracks. They are perhaps a group that we do not hear much about, but they are so very important. It bothers me when seniors are seen as victims or as people who need help. In contrast, in Quebec, our seniors are our strength. They helped build our society and they deserve to be taken care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515221">Moreover, there are many low-income seniors who help our communities by contributing to their development and building community solidarity. They may be in a precarious financial situation, but that does not keep them from contributing or volunteering for many community organizations, which have now become essential services that help us get through the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515222">Today, we are making a heartfelt appeal to the members across the way so that, in their next budget, they include a $110 monthly increase in the old age security pension and a $50 monthly increase in the guaranteed income supplement. That would enable those affected to live decently, with dignity. More importantly, it would make them feel like they matter, that they are people who deserve our support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515223">I encourage all parliamentarians to give serious thought to the Bloc Québécois motion before rejecting it. I especially encourage the government to finally include in its next budget a decent increase that respects and recognizes the contributions of the seniors, who built Quebec and Canada and who built a just and equitable society for us. Collectively, we must allow ourselves the will and the means to support them as they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515224">On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I wish the very best for our seniors, which means there must be an increase in the old age security pension and the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515227">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his very interesting question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515228">Whether one is younger, older or elderly, being single is more expensive because fixed costs are the same. That is a very important concept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515229">Like my colleague, I received dozens of letters from seniors criticizing the one-time payment. They saw it as an attempt to shut them up and tell them they would be getting $300, whether they lived by themselves or with someone else, and that was it. The government does not recognize that fixed costs have to be paid every month. A one-time payment is fine at first, but people have to keep paying for food, health care and rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515230">I agree with my colleague that the government either ignores or is insensitive to the financial plight of our seniors. We ask the government to support our motion when the vote takes place on March 8.</ParaText>

They are struggling with COVID-19, but also with affordable housing.</ParaText>

OAS is not keeping up with the increased cost of housing, the cost of food and the cost of dealing with COVID-19. So many of the services for seniors have been closed because of COVID-19, a lot of the meal and community programs. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515240">In my riding of Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook, we have a very high number of seniors. Between 2011 and 2016, the increase in seniors in my riding was greater than in any other riding in the province of Nova Scotia. We know the challenges that seniors face, such as the socio-economic and health impacts of this pandemic, have been felt around the world. Even before the virus, we were facing a number of important challenges, and many of these challenges have become more evident during this pandemic. In particular, seniors, marginalized and racialized women, Black Canadians, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, veterans and new Canadians have been disproportionately hurt by this COVID-19 recession, if I may call it that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515241">From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has done everything in its power to combat the virus and mitigate its harm by using every tool available to safeguard the health and livelihoods of Canadians. In our long-term care plan for recovery, we have committed to addressing the fundamental gaps that were exposed by this pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515242">This year has been tough on many Canadian seniors. Unfortunately, many have experienced considerable health, economic and social challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disease has disproportionately affected them, particularly those living in long-term care facilities. I have had the opportunity to talk to many seniors in Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook, and they have told me how challenging it has been, not only with the isolation but also with other challenges related to the pandemic, such as costs. The devastating COVID-19 outbreak in long-term home care has highlighted the gaps in standards of care for our most vulnerable, as the majority of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in long-term care facilities and residences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515243">From April to July of 2020, Operation Laser deployed Canadian Armed Forces personnel to support 54 long-term care facilities across Quebec and Ontario. At the peak, over 1,900 Canadian Armed Forces personnel were helping to care for seniors. </ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515245">To address this disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on seniors, the Government of Canada has made a number of investments through the fall economic statement. The government has committed $1 billion for the safe long-term care fund, building on what we have learned from the deployment of Canadian Armed Forces in long-term care homes. This fund, which helps provinces and territories to protect people in long-term care and supports infection prevention and control, will better support both those living in long-term care residences and those who work in them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515246">In order to ensure that seniors in long-term care live in safe and dignified conditions, the federal government will work with provinces and territories to set new national standards for long-term care. We remain committed to establishing these standards as a means of addressing critical gaps in long-term care facilities, including raising the working conditions of essential workers in senior care facilities, particularly personal support workers, who have persevered in the face of adversity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515247">Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Canada has introduced measures to support seniors in their daily expenses to help them weather the storm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515248">In April, we provided low- and modest-income Canadians with a one-time special payment through the GST credit. More than four million seniors benefited from this top-up, which gave an average of $375 to single seniors and $510 to senior couples. Over 6,000 seniors in my riding of Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook received those payments, equalling $2.4 million in our riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515249">We also introduced a $2.5-billion investment in a one-time tax-free payment of $300 for those seniors on OAS and an additional $200 for those seniors on GIS, for a total of $500, and that was tax free, I would remind the House. Over 10,000 seniors in our riding of Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook received this one-time $300 payment, for over $3 million, and another 3,600 seniors received the one-time $500 payment, equalling just about $5 million in total. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515250">At the same time, we are supporting programs and organizations that help improve seniors' quality of life. For example, we expanded the New Horizons for Seniors program with an additional $20 million for support organizations. We have also contributed $9 million in funding through the United Way to work with communities in each province and territory to support isolated and vulnerable seniors.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515251">We also allocated $350 million to charitable and non-profit community organizations to help vulnerable Canadians through an emergency community assistance fund. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515252">The funds provided have supported many organizations in my riding of Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook in the delivery of groceries and medicine, transportation services for medical appointments and other challenges. For example, Alice House, Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia, the Eastern Shore Family Resource Association and the MusGo Rider association, the East Preston Day Care centre, the Health Association of African Canadians, the John Howard Society of Nova Scotia and the Old School Community Gathering Place all received funding, which represented over $400,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515253">Some other accomplishments of our government for seniors since our election in 2015 have been to keep the senior eligibility age at 65 and not the age of 67 that the Conservatives wanted, and we increased the guaranteed income supplement by $947, which improves the financial security of over 900,000 vulnerable single seniors. As well, we added $6 billion for home care and community care, as well as palliative care services. Housing benefits of $4 billion was shared through the provinces and territories to provide rent support for seniors and other groups that face housing challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515254">The result, which is very important, is that 25% fewer seniors live in poverty today than in 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515255">Future commitments that we have made include increasing old age security for seniors 75 years of age and older; boosting the Canada pension plan survivor benefit; taking additional action to help people stay at home; and ensuring that everyone, including in rural and remote areas, has access to family doctors for primary care. Finally, we will move forward with our national universal pharmacare plan in the very near future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515256">These are just some of the programs and benefits that support our seniors in Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook, as well as across Canada.</ParaText>

They felt like the government was laughing at them because it was giving a lot more to others.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515261">FADOQ is an organization that represents a huge number of Quebec seniors. Representatives came to committee to tell us that they do not need standards to be implemented in long-term care facilities because such standards already exist. What they need is the means to apply those standards; in other words, they need health transfers. The government needs to do its own job and provide vaccines and personal protective equipment.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515278">Canada is what it is today because of our seniors. After a lifetime of hard work, seniors deserve to enjoy a secure and dignified retirement. My work in senior care before entering politics has made this a top concern of mine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515279">We need to always remember the value of their years of experience, their wisdom, their guidance and their care. I will say they are our greatest community of volunteers, caregivers and babysitters. They are our mentors, our teachers and advisers. They are a connection to our histories, the work and knowledge that shaped our country, our families and our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515280">In their twilight years, seniors should have the opportunity to enjoy and embrace their lives without having to fear poverty. In 2015, the Liberal government, after years of neglect by the Conservatives, has taken specific and targeted steps to reduce poverty among our seniors, and ensure that all those whose lifetime of work has brought us to where we are today are able to enjoy a proper, dignified and long retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515281">One of the government’s first steps in 2015 was to engage with the provinces to enhance the Canada Pension Plan and provide retirement security for all Canadians. After collaborating with its provincial partners, it took real actions to improve the lives of our seniors. Before this, the CPP retirement pension replaced only one quarter of someone's average work earnings. Since 2019, this has been growing, and soon the CPP pension will replace one third of their average work earnings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515282">Eligible pension earnings will also increase to $82,700, from the $54,000 a few years ago. This is a hallmark of the government’s social welfare policy and was advocated for and endorsed by CARP, an organization which, before entering politics, I co-chaired here in Ottawa. The enhanced CPP, once fully implemented, will put up to 50% more into the pockets of retirees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515283">Another fundamental component of this strategy is the additional supports provided by old age security and the guaranteed income supplement. Since the government took office in 2015, 25% fewer seniors live in poverty. Just as it did with the retirement age, the Liberal government restored the eligibility age for old age security to 65 after the previous Conservative government’s decision to raise it to 67. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515313">Another fundamental component of this strategy is the additional support provided by old age security and the guaranteed income supplement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515314">Since we took office in 2015, 25% fewer seniors live in poverty. Like the retirement age, the Liberal government restored the eligibility age for old age security to 65 after the previous government’s decision to raise it to 67. Without those changes, our vulnerable seniors would have faced a much higher risk of living in poverty, which is not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515315"> The government also introduced the guaranteed income supplement top-up. Since 2017, seniors who live alone are receiving an extra $947 per year through GIS. This is helping 900,000 vulnerable seniors across Canada, of which 70% are women.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515317">As the Liberal government clearly stated in the throne speech, our seniors need more help, and the House plans to give it to them. The Bloc Québécois, however, voted against the throne speech, clearly demonstrating that its members are not interested in a comprehensive plan to help Canada's seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515318">The government made it abundantly clear that it will increase the OAS by 10% for people 75 and up. It will also increase the Canada pension plan survivor's pension in recognition of seniors' years of work and progress, which have put them in a much better position than their forebears and prevented more of them from living in poverty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515320">Throughout the pandemic, I have been in touch with seniors in Orléans to hear how they are doing and what I, as a local representative, and our government can do to support them. During one of our round tables, they shared with me that they wanted to see a pan-Canadian standard for long-term care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515321"> Pan-Canadian standards for long-term care was a key feature in the Speech from the Throne. The Bloc voted against it. We have seen the biggest tragedies of this crisis in our long-term care homes. It should be clear to every member of the House that something needs to be done to ensure this never happens again. However, the Bloc did not support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515322"> The government’s work to build pan-Canadian standards for long-term care, understanding the importance of collaboration with provinces and territories, will prevent needless suffering and increase the quality of life for our seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515325">I would like to talk about some of the key things we have done, and I want to ensure the House realizes that this was not just one single payment. There were a multitude of aspects of our support for seniors. I was at a round table with the United Way. I was happy to see the government provide $350 million for charities and not-for-profit organizations: $9 million for United Way Canada, $100 million for food banks and local food organizations and $50 million for previously funded New Horizons for Seniors projects that could be modified to meet the needs of seniors. This one was particularly important in my community for our local seniors organization, Carrefour santé d'Orléans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515326">In conclusion, I have the greatest respect for our seniors, and I feel they are too often taken for granted. We must always strive to do a better job of supporting them and to bring in policies that will make a real difference in their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515327">Governing means making decisions that work, and the throne speech described many different ways in which the government will help seniors. The government will stay focused on what it is doing and build on its proven experience supporting seniors and fighting poverty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515329">There are two main reasons we rejected the Speech from the Throne, which she talked about in her speech. First, she spoke about standards for long-term care. In addition to the Bloc Québécois, the Quebec National Assembly and the Government of Ontario do not want these standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515330">The other thing Quebec and the provinces want that was missing from the Speech from the Throne is a permanent increase in the Canada health transfer. It must be increased from 22% to 35%. That is what Quebec and the provinces all want, because it will make it possible for them to care for people. It is unacceptable to wait until after the pandemic to increase it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515331">We recognize that there have been one-time transfers during the pandemic, but what the health care systems need in the long term in order to take care of seniors is funding, not standards. I am not the only one saying this. That is what was written in the Canadian Armed Forces report. The standards already exist.</ParaText>

With the cancellation of Keystone XL, there were seniors who finally did not have to choose between buying groceries and paying their bills because they had a boarder, a local worker, in their home. There are tremendous challenges faced by seniors across our country.</ParaText>

In the community I represent, there is not a single senior who does not fear climate change. Seniors listen to the science and see how our government can do more to improve their lives and the lives of our future generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515340">The other aspect is the fact that some organizations across our great country, which is so big, did not have access to some of the most important financial help that was available. I am very sorry, and that is why we are continuing our efforts to help people all over Canada, in rural, urban and suburban, just like Orleans, the community I represent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515346">We have heard a lot today about the financial situation of seniors. I would have liked to have all day to talk about all of the calls my office gets from constituents. Although our riding offices are closed, Internet access is not always great and we are working virtually, I feel compelled to give my speech, which will naturally reiterate everything that we have been calling for for so many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515347">Today we are debating the motion moved by my esteemed colleague from Shefford. The members of the Bloc Québécois have always stood up for seniors and always will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515348">Let us go back in time to the 2019 election campaign, when the Liberals promised to increase old age security benefits by 10% when seniors turn 75, not 65. They reiterated their intention of increasing these benefits in the September 2020 throne speech. We have sadly heard nothing since.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515349">The old age security program is the main vehicle by which the federal government supports seniors by offering people aged 65 and over a minimum income. The two programs are the old age security benefit and the guaranteed income supplement. I think this is well known, but it bears repeating. Taxpayers who are eligible for the goods and services tax credit, the GST credit, are entitled to a one-time payment ranging from $443 to $1,160, with an average payment of $375 for a single person and $510 for a couple. That is not enough in this day and age, in light of the rising cost of living and the impact of the pandemic. It is easy to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515350">Of course, supports are welcome in these most difficult times, but they should benefit every member of society, including workers, families, businesses and, of course, seniors. However, these are one-time payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515351">What we are asking for in our motion is welcomed by senior groups. We heard in previous speeches that we were giving incorrect information. Here are the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515352">The FADOQ network is the largest seniors' organization in Canada, with 550,000 members, 705 clubs and 16 regional groups, as well as around 17,000 volunteers, which is quite something. Seniors prefer stability and predictability, especially when they have a fixed income. Seniors in my riding of Laurentides—Labelle really feel overlooked. I would be remiss if I did not mention the outrageous cost of Internet access, that is, when it is available at all, which is rarely the case, just as cell coverage is also problematic. There is a huge challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515353">That said, what should the government do? Let me repeat it today for the umpteenth time: The government should invest to provide more financial assistance to all citizens, especially to seniors, through the community services network.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515354">Also, in order to mitigate the risk of people being deprived of the guaranteed income supplement, it should be possible to file an automatic income tax return. A person who fails to file a return loses the supplement. Taxpayers should be able to automatically validate their tax return, without any action needed on their part, as long as the information has not changed in comparison to the previous year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515355">Ten years ago, I was working as a political assistant for Ms. Deschamps, who sat in this House, and it was a major issue. People who did not act would not receive the supplement. They were not entitled to it. The situation is still the same in 2021.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515356">Quebec's seniors can count on the Bloc Québécois. As the government keeps saying, we will keep working and making progress. Let me talk about that progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515357">Twenty years ago, back in 2001, the Bloc called for automatic enrolment in the guaranteed income supplement at 65 based on people's tax returns. We are still calling for that, and we will keep calling for it until it is done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515358">In 2007, the former member for Laurentides—Labelle toured Quebec, meeting with seniors, groups and associations. Following the tour, a number of findings were formulated, and the Bloc decided to take action by introducing a bill to improve the lives of seniors in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515359">In 2009, the National Assembly, under a Liberal government, unanimously called on the federal government to implement the Bloc Québécois's proposals. That is a big deal. Who made that happen? The Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515360">Here is some of the real progress that came out of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515361">There was automatic renewal for claimants in 2014, as well as automatic enrolment for people on their 65th birthday, which began in 2018. This is in addition to the increase of more than $110 per month, an increase of $50 after the 2011 election and more than $60 after the 2015 election, not counting the automatic annual indexing. As of 2013, people who receive an old age security pension also receive notices to register for the guaranteed income supplement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515362">Is that not progress? I think this proves that we are there for our seniors and always will be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515363">Less than a week before the throne speech was delivered, Mr. Legault and Mr. Ford issued a joint call on September 18 for a significant increase in federal funding to help cover the rising costs of health care, but they did not specify the amount they wanted. As my colleague mentioned earlier, all the provinces as well as Quebec are demanding an increase. They called for a $28-billion increase in health transfers, to increase Ottawa's share of health care funding from 22% to 35%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515364">With the ongoing pandemic, the federal government has committed to transferring $19 billion to the provinces and Quebec, including $10 billion for health-related expenditures. For Mr. Legault and Mr. Ford, the provinces need sustainable funding, not just one-time assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515365">I could go on and on about this, but I have only a minute and a half left, so I would like to take a moment to talk about a recent forecast by the Conference Board of Canada that we heard about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515366">Health care spending will increase at an average annual rate of 5.3% until 2030-31. That is worrisome. We must do something in response. Approximately 46% of this average annual increase will be due to inflation, 18% to population growth, 19% to population aging, and the remaining 17% to better access to care and improvements to the health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515367">In closing, I want to reiterate the Bloc Québécois's proposals. I will keep repeating it even if I have to say it hundreds of times. It is about increasing OAS by $110 a month for all citizens 65 and over; the guaranteed income supplement needs to be increased by $50 a month for single individuals and by $70 a month for couples. People everywhere are unanimously calling for a 35% increase in the annual contribution to health transfers and for that contribution to be ongoing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515368">This requires the annual federal transfer to go from $42 billion to $70 billion and for it to increase by 6% every year thereafter.</ParaText>

With the carbon tax being implemented on home heating, many of them are paying, in some cases, $20 to $30 more a month. I have seen the bills.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6515389">Mr. Speaker, earlier this afternoon, I was thinking about how to approach this issue, and it occurred to me that perhaps the best way was to start with a story. I hope members will see where I am going with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515390">People refer to themselves as their father's child. I am my grandmother's child. I was raised by my grandmother. She played a rather important role in my life. I can say that I am the youngest pensioner in Canada. I received my pension at the age of 14, when my grandmother received her old age security at the age of 65. I was 14 and I told my friends that I did not need to get a job, I did not need to mow lawns because I had my grandmother.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515391">The reason I am telling this story is that seniors are the ones who generally teach us the values that will be important to us. Our parents do this, but so do our grandparents. My grandmother instilled in me values that I hold to this day. Generosity is definitely one of them, and so is the sharing of wealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515392">How can we impart these values of generosity and sharing of wealth in political life? Many years later, I understood that perhaps it could be done through social programs. That was part of what I did as a teacher. I gave social workers a course entitled “Social Policy and Citizenship”, and I saw the re-emergence of the same type of generosity and sharing of wealth that my grandmother had taught me. I rediscovered them in, among other things, the policies that I implemented in the Government of Quebec. What comes to mind immediately is Quebec's family policy, which is very generous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515393">With regard to social policies, the unfortunate thing, perhaps, is that old age security and the guaranteed income supplement are a federal responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515394">There is no denying that I am sovereignist and I am critical of the government, but I get the impression that successive federal governments are a bit cheap. As the adage goes, you can tell how important equality is to a government by the way it treats the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515395">If we look at that adage today, we might say that this government has a lot of work to do when it comes to equality. I say that because when we look more closely at the basic income seniors receive, those who receive only the guaranteed income supplement and the old age security pension are just a few dollars away from the poverty line. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515396">I cannot understand how we can be collectively okay with that in an advanced society. The values that my grandmother instilled in me are such that I think this is an aberration and if we take our work as parliamentarians seriously, it is something we should address. I say that by way of an introduction knowing full well that there is a rather simple solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515397">What we are proposing today through this motion, and what we have been wanting for some time now is an increase of $110 a month for the OAS. The guaranteed income supplement, or the GIS, would increase by $50 for single individuals and $70 for couples. I do not think that is too much to ask. What is so daunting in the government's eyes about this proposal? I was wondering earlier why they would not accept this proposal. Is it because it comes from the Bloc Québécois? It would be petty of me to say that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515398">Furthermore, I see the situation we are in and the crisis we have come through, and I must say that there have been some startling goings-on in this Parliament. During the crisis, there was the $900-million WE Charity scandal. Is that what we call helping the most vulnerable? I do not believe so. Then there are the political parties—I have a Conservative friend who is nodding, and I thank him for that, but he may well stop after he hears what I am about to say. There are political parties that saw fit to dip into the Canada emergency wage subsidy program, and they have yet to repay those benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515399">There must be some disillusioned seniors watching this. What kind of logic is there in refusing to increase the old age security and guaranteed income supplement payments? I really do not understand. I am eager to hear my Liberal colleagues' questions on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515400">In the debate on seniors, there is the whole issue of a livable income, but for me there is also another very important aspect, and that is health care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515401">There is a storm coming, and every region, not just Quebec, will have to face it. The population is aging across Quebec. Canadian society is aging. An aging population means a health care system under pressure. If the current crisis has taught us one thing, it is that we are not prepared. Quebec has a ways to go. We saw how some things were not up to par in long-term care homes, and that is putting it kindly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515402">I want to figure out with my fellow members of this House why some things were not up to par. I believe it has to do with health care funding. Health care funding in Canada is an absolute train wreck. I want to point out that fiscal imbalance is a defining characteristic of health care funding. The Séguin report was tabled by a Liberal minister, not a PQ minister. Yves Séguin was a Liberal minister. In the report he submitted to the National Assembly, he demonstrated that the Canadian federation is broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515403">The Canadian federation is broken because the federal government keeps bringing in more than it spends. During a crisis, the federal government usually balances its books at the expense of provinces by lowering their transfer payments. This has happened twice, most notably in the early 1990s under the Mulroney government. Canada was in a precarious position and Mr. Mulroney slashed health and education transfers. In doing so, he managed to balance his budget, more or less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515404">However, the world champion in every respect, the man who pioneered what some analysts call Canadian neoliberalism, is Paul Martin. Year after year, Paul Martin said that he was going to draft his budget in black and not red. He pulled surpluses out of his hat. I remember that. My whole life is based on what happened after the 1995 referendum. Immediately after the referendum, in 1995-96 and 1996-97, Paul Martin cut health transfers by about $2 billion. That is huge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515405">That decision completely tore apart the Quebec health care system. Today, the crisis we are going through is partly due to the cuts to health transfer payments in 1996-97 and 1997-98. It made taking care of seniors more difficult, and we are still feeling the effects of that today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515406">If we wish to directly improve the quality of life of seniors, we must increase the health transfer payments. I will conclude with that. The House leader repeated several times that seniors are not an area of jurisdiction. I heard him say that many times. It is quite convenient for him to use those words to evade his responsibility. In the years to come, there will be pressures on the public purse. I am sure that Conservatives and Liberals will be tempted, once again, to solve their deficit problems by reducing transfer payments to the provinces. However, the best thing they can do, if they care about seniors at all, is to listen to the Government of Quebec and increase health transfers so as to cover 35% of expenditures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515416">Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the pandemic, seniors have been facing high costs for rent, food and medications. We must increase the OAS, the GIS and the CPP to make life more affordable for seniors. I want to thank the member for his and his Bloc colleagues' advocacy in favour of permanently increasing old age security starting at age 65.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515417">Talking to seniors in my riding of Victoria, I know that this kind of increase could make a real difference. In the pandemic, seniors have been facing increased risks with isolation and financial hardship, but they are also facing horrific conditions in long-term care. We know there are more deaths and often inadequate standards of care in privatized long-term care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515418">In addition to supporting seniors by pushing for increases to the OAS, does the member agree that we need to take profit out of long-term care?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6515432">Mr. Speaker, indeed, we did have a discussion on health transfer taxes as a result of an opposition motion that the Bloc Québécois brought forward in December. It did not pass, yet here they are still talking about it. That was my point, that the Bloc members are continually and repeatedly harping on the same issue over and over again. They bring a motion before the House like they did in December to talk about the health transfers. The House debated it. We voted against it. Then they brought forward this other motion about seniors today and we are supposed to be debating it, but I hear members from the Bloc Québécois talking about health transfers. Yes, we certainly did debate and discuss that issue in December, but here they are, still talking about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515433">Nonetheless, it is an honour today to rise to talk to this issue. I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252645" Type="2">Vaughan—Woodbridge</Affiliation>. That said, I really am glad to talk about what this government has been able to accomplish on seniors' behalf and why, as a result of that, I do not think this motion is necessary given the incredible supports provided by the government to seniors throughout our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515434">Am I by any means suggesting that the mission is accomplished or that everybody is in a great position? Absolutely not. Our work will never be done in taking care of our seniors because, as has been pointed out by many members in the House today, our seniors are the ones who laid the groundwork and framework for the incredible quality of life we have today. Whether we talk about our grandparents, our great-grandparents or our parents, these are people who have done so much and inspired us to do so much for our children and for future generations so that every successive generation can have a better quality of life than the ones before. If it were not for that simple desire of human nature to improve the quality of life for future generations, what else would there really be for us in terms of our existence, for lack of a better expression?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515435">Before I get into some of those supports that have been provided by the government, I will note what others have indicated, which is extremely germane to the motion before us today as we talk about supports for seniors. I am perplexed, as many other members are, how the Bloc Québécois is bringing forward a motion to support seniors with $110 per month when they voted against a throne speech that had in it a number of measures to make sure that we could improve the quality of life of seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515436">The member for <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> has mentioned on a number of occasions that they voted against the throne speech because of the long-term care standards that the federal government wants to establish. I am sorry, but a throne speech is not a be-all, end-all document for every single individual. The entire purpose of why 338 of us come from across the country is to participate in debate in order to find compromise. If the Bloc Québécois is saying today through the member for Shefford that the sole reason they voted against the throne speech was based on their desire for national long-term care standards, I am perplexed by that. For starters, national long-term care standards, any standard that would be set up by a national government within our Constitution, certainly would only be laying the framework. It would not necessarily imply that they need to be imposed upon a provincial or territorial jurisdiction. We do not have to look that far to see the reality of that being implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515437">Look at our building code, for example. We have a national building code, but it does not mean that the provinces have to adopt it, and, indeed, Quebec and Ontario have not adopted it. They have their own standards when it comes to buildings. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515438">If we hold the two documents next to each other, we will see they are probably about 99.9% identical. The standards set by the national government are held to such high regard that they are adopted by other levels of government, because there is so much benefit in having the vast resources of a national government to create such standards. I am perplexed by the argument from members of the Bloc Québécois that they would not support a throne speech over one small item that happens to be contained therein.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515439">I also really take offence to the NDP comments I have been hearing today. In particular, one member keeps referring to “Liberal charity” as though the Liberal government is extending, on its own and solely at the Liberal Party's discretion, what resources are put into place for seniors in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515440">We come to the House as a minority government. Liberal members cannot dictate the terms of the supports that are put out there. At least in a minority government, those supports are done through various parties coming together to collaborate. The NDP voted in favour of the throne speech, if I remember correctly. If the member in the House today who has continually referred to it as “Liberal charity” is referring to what the Liberal government is providing, then he is complicit in providing that charity, because he voted in favour of the throne speech and the budget that helped implement a number of these measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515441">I want to talk briefly about some of the needs of seniors and how those are changing. It has been mentioned in the House a few times today that the needs of seniors are changing as a result of people's life expectancy. If my statistics are correct, the life expectancy of a woman today is 84 years old. For a man it is 80 years old. That is remarkable. That has to do with the incredible advances humankind has made and the quality of life we enjoy here in Canada. What we know about those statistics is this. Statistically speaking, there are more single women living in poverty. A lot of seniors continue to work. Those who do, do not always work because they have to, although unfortunately there are times when they do. There are times when seniors choose to work because they want to continue working. My father is a perfect example. He did not want to stop working at the age of 65, and continued working into his seventies before deciding to retire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515442">What we know, and what I was getting at, is that women in particular, statistically speaking, are working for lower wages. Women are working in a lot of jobs that have been direly affected by the pandemic in one way or another, such as retail, hospitality and various front-line services. Senior women in the workforce have been affected twofold, in that they work a lot more in front-line jobs and jobs directly impacted by the demands the pandemic has created, and have been affected by layoffs and other effects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515443">I see I have already burned through my time. I will have to be more careful about how I go on. I will say this. I believe this government has done a number of incredible things. Regarding this pandemic alone, $350 million has been given to charities, $9 billion to the United Way, which has been distributing money throughout individual communities, $100 million to the food banks and $50 million to the New Horizons for Seniors program.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515444">This government has demonstrated that it is there for seniors and that it will continue to be there for seniors. I do not see this motion as any more than the Bloc trying to play and perhaps create a political wedge for the government. I respect its need to do that, but I disagree with it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515465">I would like to reiterate that in the last election we committed to Canadians that we would increase old security by 10% for seniors aged 75 and up. Our proposal recognizes that older seniors have different needs. As seniors age, they are more likely to outlive their savings, have disabilities, be unable to work and be widowed, all while their health care costs are rising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515466">For seniors over 75, few work. Those that do work have a median employment income of only $720; half have a disability, half of which are severe; 57% are women; four in 10 are widows; 59% have incomes below $30,000 and 39% of these seniors receive the guaranteed income supplement. These are real pressures on the quality of life for older seniors. Our government recognizes their needs and will help address them by increasing old age security by 10% for seniors aged 75 and up. It is clear that our proposals understand the need to support older women who face unique and elevated challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515467">More broadly, we have understood that Canadians need a government that steps up. At the very onset of the pandemic, we acted quickly to assist Canadians by issuing financial assistance so they could pay their bills. We acted swiftly to introduce the CERB, the Canada emergency student benefit, the emergency wage subsidies and extra income for families, seniors and persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515468"> These measures, like all the measures put in place by our government, are aligned with our commitment to inclusion and diversity.

              <ParaText id="6515470">Allow me to provide an overview of our emergency measures for seniors, including women, seniors with disabilities and racialized seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515471">As we know, seniors are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Part of a GBA+ way of thinking means knowing the facts. Statistically, in Canada, women over the age of 65 have a slightly longer life expectancy than men. In 2019, just over half of the Canadian population over 65 were women, so COVID-19 relief measures affecting this age bracket will help alleviate hardship among senior women in particular. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515472">For instance, the government made a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 to seniors who are eligible for the OAS benefit, with an extra $200 for those who are eligible for the GIS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515473">This amounts to a total of $500 for seniors who are eligible for both the OAS and the GIS to help them cover rising costs related to COVID-19. Eligible seniors received their one-time payment last summer.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515474">In addition to senior women facing heightened barriers and challenges during the pandemic, female seniors with disabilities have also been disproportionately impacted.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515475">According to the latest available data, there are more Canadian women than men living with disabilities: 2.1 million women versus 1.7 million men. Women with disabilities are particularly vulnerable right now because they are more likely to be experiencing financial difficulties. What is more, more than half are victims of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515476">Last April, in keeping with the principles of GBA+, our government created the COVID-19 disability advisory group. This group applied an intersectional lens to accessibility and inclusion in the context of the current pandemic and raised key issues affecting Canadians with disabilities. With the help of this group, Health Canada developed guidelines to ensure that Canadians with disabilities are protected during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515477">Thanks in part to the group's advice, we recognized that people with disabilities needed help to cover the extraordinary expenses they have had to incur during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6515478">That is why our government also provided a one-time payment of $600 to certificate holders of the disability tax credit. Eligible seniors who were also receiving the credits I mentioned previously would be eligible for a top-up, for a maximum of $600 in benefits. The group was such a success that it has been made a permanent advisory group to the <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">Minister of Disability Inclusion</Affiliation>, and our intersectional framework is continuing with the announcement last fall of the disability inclusion action plan, which will create an income benefit modelled after the guaranteed income supplement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515479">Now I will say a word about racialized seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515480">The pandemic has laid bare many gaps in our support systems and brought deeply rooted inequalities to the surface. We have seen a resurgence of public concern with systemic racism in the United States and in Canada.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>

              <ParaText id="6515482">Part of the issue is that we lack data on the specific experiences of Black or racialized seniors, and we know very little about how racialized seniors who are women or persons with disabilities have been impacted by the pandemic. I can assure members that having better data to inform policy is a priority for our government and in line with our GBA+ approach to programs and services.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515506">Today, the Bloc Québécois tabled a simple, sensible, empathetic and caring motion. Logically, this rational, judicious bill should transcend party stances and party lines. This motion targets a particular segment of the population, the only segment that was neglected during this pandemic and has in fact been neglected for decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515507">To sum up, the motion “asks the government, in the next budget, to increase the Old Age Security benefit by $110 a month for those aged 65 and more.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515508">We have heard a lot about how underfunding is affecting seniors. I would like to take a moment to look at what this means in concrete terms. The $110 a month adds up to $8 billion, but some of that gross amount will be returned to the government in the form of taxes. People who earn more than $80,000 per year pay a lot of tax. Some who currently get the guaranteed income supplement will no longer get it. Essentially, that $8 billion ends up as $4 billion net. That is what the Bloc Québécois's motion would actually cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515509">A mere $4 billion for our seniors, hitherto neglected by the government, is not much compared to the flood of subsidies and cash the government has been handing out over the past year. Four billion dollars is a drop in the bucket compared to $400 billion. It is also very little compared to numbers like the one that came out today, Irving Shipbuilding's $57-billion cost overrun. That is a single cost overrun totalling $57 billion, when the Bloc is asking for a mere $4 billion. Our seniors deserve that much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515510">Given that I do not have much time, I would like to conclude by stating that the Bloc Québécois motion calls for good judgment, consideration of the priorities that we want to have as a society, and respect for these people who today can no longer express their discontent or articulate their needs, much less take to the streets to express what they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515511">Today, the Bloc Québécois is the voice of seniors. Today, the Bloc Québécois stands on behalf of seniors. I will leave my colleagues with these three words to guide our vote on this motion: judgment, priorities and respect. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515529">The bill focuses on wells and what we do when wells are no longer active, and the Conservatives are proposing this tax credit. I do not know to what degree they have really thought it out. For example, it would seem to apply to every company under a set price; I think it is about 100,000 barrels, in terms of the daily average. Outside of that one criterion, it seems that, as long as someone meets that requirement, they would be able to apply. It would not focus federal support on only the companies that need it; it is more a case that we would give the tax credit, no matter whether they needed the support or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515530">I believe that the government has approached this issue in a very progressive fashion. In fact, our COVID-19 supports have included nearly $1.7 billion, that is, more than $1.5 billion, in support for those orphan well closures in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515531">All of us are concerned about workers in the energy sector. There have been some very difficult times, we recognize that, but unlike the impression many Conservatives try to give, sometimes things are beyond one's control. The pandemic is something we could not have prevented. No country could have done that, as this is a worldwide issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515532">When former prime minister Harper was leaving office, we started to see a depreciation in world prices. It started before he left office and has continued. When we think of it, oil and gas producers are coping with two crises that have had a very serious impact in the energy sector and the workers in that sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515533">I believe the proper thing for the government to do was to look at ways we could assist, and one of those ways was to look at cleaning up those tens of thousands of inactive and abandoned wells. It is not a small amount of money. We are going into hundreds of millions of dollars. As I said, it would be over $1.5 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515534">There are two crises situations, the global pandemic and the aftershocks of the global price war, and now we have companies trying to react and make changes to their operations that are so badly needed. We will come out okay at the end of the day, because we recognized how important it is to be there for the industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515535">A number we often hear is that one out of every three workers in the areas of mining, oil and gas were able to stay in their jobs because of the Canada emergency wage subsidy program. We often hear criticisms about the program and how company X received the program or company Y received the program. However, when I look at the literally millions of jobs that have been saved as a direct result of that program, I believe it was well worth the federal dollars to make the program what it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515536">The energy sector is a very good example of how a sector within our communities was able to capitalize on a program that will enable the industry as a whole to rebound that much better going forward. Because of the supports provided, we were able to keep people in the workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515537">When we talk about the capping of wells, a big part is the issue of the climate and our climate record. This government has taken many, over 40, different emission-reducing measures over the years. In fact, we are on track to cut pollution by more than any other Canadian government in its history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515538">I like to think investments in things like public transit, energy efficiency and having a price on pollution all matter. Investing in Canadians and offering support where we can is what I believe this government has done well over the last 12 months, but even more than that, over the last four years.</ParaText>

          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Pauzé" id="11158055">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252574" Type="2">Ms. Monique Pauzé (Repentigny, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6515539">Mr. Speaker, introducing a bill is always an important moment in the life of a legislator, and so is the time when that bill is debated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515540">I therefore commend the member for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>, and I want to explain to her why the Bloc Québécois will not be supporting her bill. In environmental policy, there is a basic principle known as the polluter pays principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515541">According to this principle, to which the Bloc Québécois subscribes, it is up to businesses to assume the costs of environmental damage related to their operations. The provisions of the member for Lakeland's Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document> fail to respect that basic principle. The very principle of granting a tax credit in an attempt to force companies to assume their responsibilities would mean funding an industry that is harmful to the environment rather than funding the energy transition. We agree with the hon. member that it is not up to Alberta taxpayers to pay the full cost of shutting down orphaned wells, but nor is it up to Quebec, the provinces and territories. This is the perfect opportunity to recognize the merit of the polluter pays principle and to implement it as rigorously as possible. Until the shift to clean energy is completed so that Canada can move away from fossil fuels, which we hope happens as quickly as possible, governments will have to strengthen their environmental policies and come up with effective ways to hold resource companies accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515542">Two years ago, the Supreme Court upheld the polluter pays principle in the Redwater Energy case by overturning a ruling from Alberta's highest court holding that repaying the creditor bank of the bankrupt company should take precedence over cleaning up abandoned sites. The Supreme Court disagreed and said that the priority is the cleanup, that decontaminating the environment takes precedence over repaying creditors when an oil company goes bankrupt. It even specified that the creditors and fiduciaries claiming to have priority were in fact people who benefited from the company's economic activity and who were, as a result, bound by the same regulatory obligations as the bankrupt company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515543">Between 2016 and 2019, in only three years, there were 28 bankruptcies involving 10,000 sites in Alberta for a total value of $335 million. Over the same period, the Orphan Well Association's inventory grew by 300%. This NGO, also known as OWA, claims to be independent, funded primarily by the industry and under the regulatory authority of the Alberta Energy Regulator. Is that really the case? Let us continue. Its mandate is to close wells, plants and pipelines who are no longer under the responsibility of financially solvent owners in order to protect the public and the environment and to eliminate the potential threat posed by these unfunded liabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515544">If the industry properly funded the OWA to really repair the environmental damage caused by failed companies, would we still be talking about even more taxpayer dollars being funnelled to the fossil fuels industry? The federal funding that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> spoke of earlier, the $1.7 billion announced last spring to clean up and close orphaned wells, is taxpayer money. Albertans also fund, through loans, the restoration of hundreds of wells—more taxpayer dollars. What about guaranteed federal loans with public money from all across the country? Even more taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515545">The tax credit proposed in Bill C-221 will not prevent the inevitable decline of the fossil fuel sector, especially not for the qualifying corporations the bill identifies. The explosion in the number of sites that the OWA is now responsible for clearly illustrates this reality. It is in the economic interest of the western provinces to diversify. Even the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, says that demand for oil will plateau and will not grow much in the next 25 years, while renewable energy is already growing and will continue to grow even faster over the same period. In this context, we must approach the problem of bankruptcies head-on and make sure that governments reform and tighten their criteria for how companies finance the end of their facilities' life.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515546">Forcing society at large to pay for the environmental costs of an industry that not only degrades the surrounding environment, but puts communities at risk and compromises our climate future, is neither fair nor legitimate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515547">For public funds spent on closing wells to be considered an investment, such expenditures would need to be made in the wider context of a comprehensive energy transition plan. If such a plan were implemented, making an investment to restore the environment around the wells would be considered a measure to ensure a fair transition. It would have the dual benefit of protecting the environment and supporting energy sector workers during the necessary transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515548">However, as a stand-alone bill, Bill C-221 is a tax incentive to support the development of business models and an industry that are making no attempt to mitigate the impact of the environmental degradation for which it is responsible. Any financial support provided to manage the environmental risks that continuously result from the fossil fuel industry must be attached to restrictive environmental regulations, as well as other preventive measures, in order to avoid endlessly exacerbating the situation and the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515549">There is one good program called area-based closures, where well operators work together to minimize the cost of restoring sites. It is a good program and a step in the right direction, but participation is voluntary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515550">We need to do more to protect the environment and our health and to address the climate emergency. One thing is for sure: Well operators must take note of the Supreme Court decision I mentioned earlier. Provincial governments, for their part, must create regulatory tools tied to taxation laws to enforce the Supreme Court decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515551">In the Supreme Court Redwater case, the appellant, the Alberta Energy Regulator, estimated the province's oil and gas liability at $30 billion or more. These massive costs, which are a relatively conservative estimate, are over and above the ever-increasing costs of greenhouse gas emissions, the impact on human health and the destruction of natural environments in the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515552">A multi-level governmental review of the fossil fuel regulatory environment, which would empower governments to hold those benefiting from the resource responsible, is decades overdue. The orphan well problem, which is not addressed in Bill C-221, is real, it is current, and it is definitely connected to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515553">In conclusion, the Orphan Well Association, or OWA, has had expanded powers since the spring of 2020, powers that were granted in the middle of a pandemic under two amendments adopted to its enabling legislation by the Government of Alberta. According to published information, these powers affect three areas: the role that the OWA plays in promoting the closure of sites, the role it plays in ensuring that oil and gas sites are not abandoned prematurely, and increased financial control to manage sites that may eventually be abandoned, as well as those under its control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515554">These wells are being kept in good working order, but why? To what end? Essentially, the OWA can now buy up sites before they are abandoned, which helps the company. Then it will clean up the defective sites, which did not use to happen, meaning the industry is relieved of its responsibility yet again. That is the direction that the Alberta government would like to move in with the OWA, which now works in service of the companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515555">The Bloc Québécois has already indicated that it is prepared to stand with workers and families in western Canada, but efforts need to be made to break the Canadian economy's dependence on fossil fuels. We have proposed concrete measures in favour of a recovery plan, but we are still waiting for the government's green recovery strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515556">Without a comprehensive strategy, Bill C-221 is just a glorified subsidy for the fossil fuel industry. The Bloc Québécois's position is clear: We are against any subsidy for that sector. The pandemic must not be used as an excuse to make the public pay the high price of environmental damage.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252805" Type="2">Mr. Tom Kmiec (Calgary Shepard, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6515557"> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate on this very important issue, which my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation> has proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515558">I have listened to the debate so far, and as an Albertan, I am disappointed to hear that other members will not be supporting a piece of legislation that is good for the environment. I have heard people say that it is good for oil and gas companies, but this is about the environment. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation> has proposed a means for the private sector to contribute additional funds to remediate oil and gas wells that are basically at the end of their useful life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515559"> I do not know how many members have done this, but I have walked along a well line that was successfully remediated and got its environmental certificate from the Government of Alberta. As far my eyes could see, I could no longer see where the drill pad had been. It was restored to a state of nature, where animals and everybody else could walk and use it on an everyday basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515560"> This is the result of an inevitable shift from conventional oil and gas to unconventional oil and gas production, which is mostly the bitumen oil sands, SAGD operations and in situ operations. What we sometimes see, ridiculously presented as what happens in the northeast corner of Alberta by, say, the National Geographic, is the open-pit mining, which is the way of the past. Those are very old mines that will be decommissioned in 10 to 20 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515561">However, members can look at the legislative costing note provided by the Parliamentary Budget Officer for Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document>. It is flow-through shares, and this is the solution for decommissioning costs. Yes, there are a lot of oil sites, as the previous member mentioned. The Orphan Well Association is a repository for a company that goes bankrupt or into receivership and returns its energy leases to the people of Alberta when it can no longer operate. There was a fund set up in order to pay for these things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515562">I hear a member chirping away and disagreeing with me, but it is a solution for private-sector dollars to be put towards an environmental goal. It is not offsetting all of a company's costs. We are talking about wells that produce the equivalent of 100,000 or fewer barrels per day. I think this is what we want. We want the private sector to be more involved in remediating environmental costs associated with production. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515563">In my riding, where Imperial Oil has its headquarters, a lot of oil and gas workers are unemployed, and this would put them back to work. There is a very slight time window that these flow-through shares would work for, which is basically between 2019 and 2026. We are talking about a very small group of wells that would be eligible for this. Companies could use this to offset some of the costs associated with it, but it is for the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515564">The bill before us has an excellent goal behind it. Why would we not support it? It would get people back to work with jobs. It would improve the environment, our landscapes and ecosystems. It offers an opportunity for us to do something that we are going to have to do anyway, which is fix up these well sites, which are all over Alberta, usually on people's properties. They will need to be remediated either way. Again, this is not for companies. It is for the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515565">To me, the downside is that it would cost $264 million by 2026, according to the PBO's cost estimate. However, it would get people who have great technical skills back to work and back out in the field. An excellent way of putting people back into the field is remediating these oil and gas wells. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515566">The industry is the best in the world when it comes to this type of environmental work. There are wildlife biologists, people whose expertise is in rough fescue, which naturally grows in the foothills of Alberta. They are ready to go and do the work required for well remediation sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515567">It was only a few years ago when some of the major Suncor sites were being remediated. What used to be an open-pit mine was completely remediated. We now have bison roaming again. It is a natural environment. One would not be able to tell what had been there, if it was not for the giant sign at the front of the site saying it used to be an open-pit mine. We have these large-scale industrial sites all over Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515568">I have known the member for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation> for a very long time, even pre-politics. We were in different provincial political parties. I am sure she would admit, and she would probably laugh at this, that we were probably each in the wrong political party. We likely would have identified as being in another one, should we have discussed it then. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515569">However, she has been working at this for a long time. This type of proposal, had it been in place a decade or two ago, would have been able to support the sector and jobs in Alberta. We would not have to just wait for the Orphan Well Association to help remediate the sites for companies who can dig deep into foreign sources of capital to pay for remediation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515570">This would have been available for the smaller oil and gas companies in Alberta. It would have been available for the private sector. We say we have an ESG goal, say in a hedge fund or an equity fund, and we want to meet those. We have environmental and social goals that our fund investors want to meet. There is an opportunity right there. It would put tens of thousands of people back to work improving our environment and our landscapes. What could be better than that? We are using the Income Tax Act to do it, to offset some of the cost, not all of the cost, of this proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515571">I just do not see a downside to passing such a piece of legislation when the goal behind it is not subsidizing oil and gas companies but improving our environment. I just do not understand why other members of this House who had been in there originally will not support a piece of legislation like this. When we thought about this originally, it was just a total win on both sides. We would achieve a private sector goal, which is obviously to make a profit; and we would achieve an environmental goal, which is the remediation and improvement of our environment and the restoration of it to the condition it was in before industrial work was done on the property.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515572">There is a Yiddish proverb that says, “he that cannot pay, let him pray.” Madam Speaker, I know you enjoy the Yiddish proverbs as much as I do. However, that is the case here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515574">Madam Speaker, I hear the same member chirping away again. I am sure it is a different condition out there in Hamilton and the regions that he comes from, but in my neck of the woods, in the southeast part of Calgary, I have a lot of oil and gas workers who have been out of work for years now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515575">Their severance pay has run out, they have no more space in a home equity line of credit, they are at the limit of what they can afford and the outlook is grim. For many of them, their kids, spouses, friends and former co-workers have moved to the United States or Algeria or South America to seek work, because there is a booming industry worldwide for oil and gas development. That might be hard to believe, but it is still going on. One of my neighbours is an LNG specialist, and he spent time working in Venezuela. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515576">I have a lot of family members who moved out west specifically for work opportunities. Lots of those have dried up, and in connected industries the same thing is happening. We know in Alberta that oil and gas is not going to bounce back to the same as it was before. We have been through this before. Albertans are extremely resilient. This is not the first bust that we have experienced, frankly, and there will be other booms and other busts in the future. We have adapted, every single time, by changing our legislation, changing our regulations and looking after the environment. That is what we do best. That is what this piece of legislation proposes to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515577">Through this, I see an opportunity to harness the power of the private sector to invest in things that it cares about. I see these hedge funds and equity funds out there, all over North America, looking toward investing in projects that have environmental and social goals behind them. ESG is the way of the future. Many of them are looking at things like carbon net-zero investments that they would like to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515578"> My riding is home to one of the most efficient gas turbine electricity-producing power stations in North America, with something like a 98% to 99% efficiency, producing half of the city of Calgary's electrical power. It is hyperefficient. There are barely any people working in that facility, and it has now added on a carbon capture and carbon utilization system as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515579">Projects like this are how we are going to get to our environmental goals. Changes like this to the Income Tax Act would help the private sector achieve the environmental goals that we all share in this House. Climate change is real. We have to address it. This is a way to get there because, as I said, “he that cannot pay, let him pray.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515580">We are done praying. There is an opportunity here to make sure that the private sector pays for these types of costs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515581">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document>, which seeks to amend the Income Tax Act and establish a tax incentive for the closure of oil and gas wells.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515582">I want to acknowledge the work of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>, with whom I am fortunate to serve on the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515583">I can say in no uncertain terms that, unfortunately, the Bloc Québécois does not support this bill for one very simple reason that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252574" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation> already pointed out: Bill C-221 is inconsistent with the polluter pay principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515584">What is the polluter pay principle? It is a basic environmental policy principle supported by all those who believe that the environment is a priority. The Bloc Québécois therefore wholeheartedly supports it. This principle stipulates that companies need to assume the costs of any environmental damage they do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515585">It is simple. If a party causes environmental damage, then it must pay to fix it. If it cannot be fixed, then the party pays to compensate for the irreparable harm it has done to nature. It is not up to the government or taxpayers to absorb those costs. That would be unfair and illogical. That would mean collectively agreeing to pay to fix the environmental damage caused by oil and gas companies, while receiving no collective benefit from the profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515586">That is the problem the Bloc Québécois has with Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document>. If this bill were to pass, oil and gas companies would be given a tax credit for assuming their responsibilities. In other words, if we say yes to Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document>, we are saying yes to more funding for an industry that we know is harmful to the environment, rather than increasing funding for the energy transition. That reasoning does not hold water in 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515587">Obviously, it is not as if the oil and gas industry was the poor cousin in Canada. As a matter of fact, in April 2020, less than a year ago, the federal government provided $1.7 billion in financial assistance to clean up and decommission orphan wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515588">It does not stop there. Alberta already funds hundreds of well reclamation projects within its jurisdiction. That province offers loans to oil and gas companies, and the payment of interests is secured by none other than the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515589">They will say that this support is needed in a pandemic and that workers in western Canada need support. We agree with helping workers and companies in times of crisis, but taxpayers already absorb much of the environmental costs from the oil and gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515590">Moreover, it seems to me that the pandemic has become an excuse for a lot of things, much too many things. The present environmental crisis cannot be swept under the rug under the pretense that a public health crisis is raging. That kind of rhetoric no longer holds water in 2021 either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515591">The scientific evidence is too compelling on the cause-and-effect relationship between the destruction of the environment in the past decades and the pandemic we are living through. We cannot afford to legislate only to potentially hold oil and gas producers accountable. We must enshrine in law the requirement to start the energy transition, and yet, Bill C-221 would have the opposite effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515592">Do we believe that oil and gas companies would change their ways if the government compensated them for their environmental mistakes? I think I know the answer: not a chance. Using taxpayer money to pay the environmental costs of an industry that damages the environment, puts communities at risk and compromises our climate future is completely irresponsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515593">The member for Lakeland, who introduced this bill, says that it is not up to Alberta's taxpayers to assume 100% of the cost of decommissioning orphan wells. She is quite right, but I am sure she would agree with me that it is not up to Quebec taxpayers to pay for it either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515594">The Bloc Québécois recognizes the urgent need to deal with orphan wells, and we are prepared to support pragmatic solutions to this problem. However, these solutions must meet certain conditions. They must respect the polluter pays principle, they must contribute to an overall effort to make the energy transition, they must come with regulations and, last of all, they must help Canada meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515595">The Bloc Québécois is willing to discuss amendments to Bill C-221 in order for it to meet the conditions I mentioned. In this debate about orphan wells, it is important to have a broader conversation and to be aware of the importance of tackling climate change without further delay. More and more people are insisting that we, the elected members, address this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515596">A 2017 study by the C.D. Howe Institute showed that of some 450,000 listed oil and gas wells in Alberta, about 155,000 were no longer active but had not been completely cleaned up. In the spring of 2020, the Pembina Institute estimated that there were 164,000 abandoned wells in the province. The institute reported that these wells carried risks and expenditures that had not been borne by the owners, even though the owners benefited from the wells when they were active. The same study showed that for Albertans, the potential costs of cleaning up these abandoned wells could be as high as $8 billion, and that was in 2017. Of course, today, the costs would be even higher.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6515597">In fact, official estimates by the Alberta Energy Regulator, the only regulatory body for the energy sector in the province, value oil and gas liabilities at over $30 billion. However, internal documents estimate the total cleanup costs of Alberta's oil and gas sector, including the oil sands, at $260 billion. Should Albertans pay the price for the oil and gas sector's environmental carelessness? Should all Quebeckers and Canadians foot the bill? The answer is obvious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515598">We know that the economic downturn Alberta has faced for 10 years pushed many oil companies to bankruptcy. The province was left with thousands of wells left unattended by companies that did not bother to clean up their mess. That is a huge environmental problem, but it is also a public health and safety issue. These abandoned wells can contaminate the water and the soil, release greenhouse gases and put nearby houses at risk of exploding. It is a growing problem that companies keep sweeping into taxpayers' backyards. So much for being good corporate citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515599">A lawyer from Ecojustice, a Vancouver-based group of lawyers who specialize in environmental law, said that the best way for the province to address the problem of abandoned oil wells is to require companies to make a security deposit before drilling. That would be a more forward-looking solution than Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document>. We need to fix the mistakes of the past first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515600">The issue of orphan wells needs to be addressed, but there need to be strict conditions to warrant having the public cover the cost. Any financial assistance associated with environmental risks, such as the decommissioning of orphan wells, must be done in conjunction with changes to the environmental regulations. Preventive measures must also be taken to stop perpetually aggravating this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515601">We simply cannot vote in favour of a bill that sustains an industry that is causing environmental degradation. Alberta and the other oil- and gas-producing provinces have the power to make regulations that would require the industry to take care of its wells. The pandemic must not be used as an excuse for deregulating the environmental protection sector. There are ways to prevent more orphan wells from popping up in Alberta. There are ways to avoid making the public pay astronomical bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515602">Environmental trusts exist precisely to allow producers to share the risk among themselves in case one of them goes bankrupt. Oil and gas companies should be required to maintain enough assets to cover the costs of dismantling and cleaning up their facilities. In the event of bankruptcy, the law should require companies to fulfill their environmental responsibilities before having to pay off their creditors. To avoid bankruptcies, governments should modify their criteria to require companies to finance the end of life of their wells upfront. In short, laws and taxes should be used to prevent problems, not to fix them after the fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515603">In conclusion, investing public money to fix the problem of orphan wells would only be justifiable if it were part of a comprehensive, ambitious plan for an energy transition. If such a plan existed, the investment necessary for closing down these wells would have the dual impact of protecting the environment and supporting energy sector workers and their families during the transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515604">The Bloc Québécois has proposed a green recovery plan, with concrete solutions for a successful energy transition. In its plan, the Bloc suggests, among other things, that the unused funds from the Trans Mountain expansion project be redirected toward renewable energy projects to create jobs, a large part of which could be earmarked for Alberta to support its green transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515605">However, we are still waiting for the Liberal government's comprehensive strategy for a green recovery. Without stricter environmental regulations, measures like the tax credit proposed in Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document> amount to little more than a new kind of subsidy for the fossil fuel industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515606">The economic recovery policy should include powerful incentives to encourage companies to move away from fossil fuels and invest in clean and renewable technologies. The Bloc Québécois cannot support a bill that would make taxpayers bear the staggering costs of Canada's dependence on oil. The Bloc Québécois is prepared to stand in solidarity with the taxpayers, workers and families of western Canada on condition that laws and regulations are put in place to end the Canadian economy's dependence on fossil fuels from the previous century.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6515609">Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the debate on my PMB, Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document>, the environmental restoration incentive act, which is one part of what must be a multipronged approach to a current and future risk that needs resolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515610">There is rarely a single perfect public policy remedy to a complex real-world challenge. Exponentially increasing orphaned and abandoned wells are mainly a result of major bankruptcies and a widespread economic collapse, caused in part by Canada's own anti-energy federal government and the 2019 Redwater decision that prevents struggling small oil and gas developers from getting private financing when nearing bankruptcy with outstanding remediation liabilities. The federal government can take real action while provinces do their part. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515611">My bill exclusively focuses on the most financially challenged small and medium-sized oil and gas businesses and fairly proposes to include this tool that is currently available to other sectors, such as exploration development in mining, fabrication of metals and other technologies such as wind turbines, geothermal energy and fuel cells. Before 2017, flow-through shares could be used by oil and gas producers for drilling and exploration too. It makes sense to extend it to the smallest, most at-risk energy businesses in Canada, which cannot secure private sector financing due to their precarious economic positions and liabilities, specifically to encourage the remediation and reclamation efforts that they were doing under normal financial circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515612">It is a no-brainer. Why should flow-through share provisions be limited to the extraction and production fees of resource development and not be available as an environmental remediation tool? <Affiliation DbId="253058" Type="2">South Okanagan—West Kootenay</Affiliation>'s NDP MP said he accepts the use of flow-through shares for mining extraction. I wonder why we cannot all agree that they should be used to stimulate private sector financing for restoration as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515613">What is very odd is that the MPs who like flow-through shares for production but not remediation also offered support for a colleague's intended bill for qualifying environmental trusts. I supported it also, but the fact is that it would have immediately helped only the largest producers with the advantage of cash on hand. My Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document> helps the smallest businesses on the edge of bankruptcy, businesses that cannot get financing and cannot or will not access the federal government's predatory payday style LEEFF loans or the BDC's co-lending and mid-market programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515614">Some colleagues say my bill is a subsidy. I have explained extensively why it is not and I will not revisit that question, but I must emphasize that my intent is to protect taxpayers in the long run and limit public liability. My bill is a discount for Canadian taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515615">Canada’s oil and gas sector contributed $493 billion in revenues to governments in Canada between 2000 and 2018. That is $26 billion per year. The PBO says my bill will cost $264 million in total, ending in 2026. It could potentially cost taxpayers everywhere $70 billion for all 130,000 active and inactive wells in Canada today.</ParaText>

                <Affiliation DbId="253047" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation>’s Liberal MP talked about the need to support measures that help companies avoid bankruptcy and support our environmental targets. Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document> does exactly those things, but deliberately limits the use of public funds by enabling the lion’s share of financing, specifically for remediation and reclamation, to come from the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515617">Bloc MPs urged the polluter pay principle. Yes, the Conservatives enshrined it in law, but the fact is that voting against my bill goes against that principle, ignores the realities of small and medium-sized oil and gas businesses and workers on the edge of total devastation, and leaves either a lack of remediation or only taxpayers liable.</ParaText>

The NDP MP said that Canadian taxpayers should not foot the bill and I agree. However, inaction, doing nothing, defeating this bill, would help guarantee they would. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515633">Frankly, the objections have been mostly ideological and geographical, with no real alternative proposals. This is a challenge across Canada in most provinces. In Alberta alone, most wells are on private land. Financially forced abandonments are magnets for rural crime, but there are tens of thousands of wells on government land, on Crown grazing leases, and thousands on indigenous reserve lands too. What happens to all of them when companies go bankrupt?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515634">Since 2015, Canada’s energy sector has lost $200 billion and 200,000 jobs while orphan and abandoned wells have increased 300%. That is not a coincidence, but a consequence. That was before 37% of oil and gas companies had to make permanent layoffs to stay alive at the start of last year. There is little light at the end of the tunnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515635">I passionately support Canada’s oil and gas workers. The sector is the most environmentally and socially responsible in the world. It is crucial to the whole country’s economy and future. Bill <Document DbId="10866141" Type="4">C-221</Document> can help continue its unmatched stewardship, clean-tech investment and innovation exceeding standards, while protecting farmers, municipalities, land owners, indigenous communities, the environment, taxpayers, and creating badly needed jobs.

              <ParaText id="6515644">Madam Speaker, I am raising an issue today in our adjournment proceedings that I originally raised on December 3 during Oral Questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515645">Almost a year ago, the UN Women issued a statement calling violence against women and girls the shadow pandemic. This should come as no surprise and it should not have taken COVID to expose the ways our society perpetuates this violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515646">The data tells us that half of all women in Canada have experienced at least one incident of physical or sexual violence since the age of 16. Approximately every six days, a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. Despite decades of research and community activism across the country, violence against those identifying as women, girls or two-spirit people persists as a manifestation of misogyny, objectification and discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515647">Women from all walks of life are victims and survivors of various types of physical, sexual and psychological violence inflicted by intimate partners: people they trust and often share their homes and lives with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515648">In 1982, MP Margaret Mitchell prompted a ruckus in the House of Commons that sparked national awareness of domestic violence. She told the House that one in 10 Canadian husbands regularly beat their wives. The male MPs erupted, laughing and shouting. She furiously replied that this is no laughing matter.</ParaText>

I think of the recent government-funded, victim-blaming ad campaign in Montreal that showed an image of a young girl with a bag over her head, as though it was her fault that sexually explicit images of her were being passed around by anonymous men and boys on the Internet. This is unacceptable and adds to the hesitancy to report such abuses for fear of backlash.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515651"> In my home province, a group of survivors of sexual assault have gone public this week saying that they have been manipulated by the provincial government, and their experiences and research are being used as a way for the government to create the illusion of wanting to help. We need government leadership and allyship that goes beyond illusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515652">We know the statistics are worse for indigenous women; Black women; queer, non-binary and two-spirited women; newcomer women; women with disabilities; and women who are otherwise marginalized. Our approach must centre on an intersectional lens to address the unique and specific challenges of those facing the highest rates of gender-based violence. I will use this opportunity to remind the government of its responsibility to put forward the action plan to address the findings of the inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515653">The challenges of COVID-19 cannot be an excuse for the delay. As I have outlined, the urgency has only increased, and we must respond. No more stolen sisters. No more bright lights snuffed out in the night. We need to act. We need a cultural shift. I believe it can start with leadership, and it starts with our generation here and now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515654">As the mother of young boys, I teach my children to respect all people, to find the right language to address their emotions and talk about the ways they may be struggling. I talk to them about tough subjects and the hard truths in this world, but I also teach them about the opportunity to change it. I empower them to do their part and trust their abilities. I am proud that my children are also young indigenous boys, <I>Wolastoqew</I>, who will be encouraged to end gender-based violence, and to lift up and protect the women in their community. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515656">Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252667" Type="2">Fredericton</Affiliation> for her hard work and advocacy on this important subject. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515657">Since 2015, our government has been working to prevent gender-based violence, to address the root causes, and support long-term solutions. We have worked with women's movements and organizations on the ground who have been doing this work for decades, even when the government before us left them underfunded and undermined for 10 years. We know that the experience and knowledge of these groups is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515658">Ending gender-based violence does not happen overnight, but I can confirm that our government will continue to be collaborative, persistent and committed to sustainable change. Thanks to the investments of our government in women and gender equality, six million people benefit each year. In 2017, we announced the first-ever federal strategy to prevent and address gender-based violence by bringing together all federal efforts to prevent GBV. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515659">Think about that: It took 150 years for a federal strategy to be created and designed to prevent GBV. Through the federal strategy, over $200 million has been invested to expand and align federal efforts against gender-based violence. Through that strategy, we have supported innovative projects and programming with a whole-of-government approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515660"> Here are a few examples: Developing a framework to address gender-based violence in post-secondary institutions; creating and testing innovative practices to prevent teen dating violence; supporting the Canadian Centre for Child Protection; addressing gaps in supports for indigenous survivors of GBV across the country. Building on the foundations laid by the strategy, we are now working with provincial and territorial governments and indigenous leaders to advance the national action plan to end gender-based violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515661">The key word there is “national”. In January, just a month ago, federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for the status of women came together over a few days with a joint declaration on a commitment to a Canada free from gender-based violence. This is such a significant milestone. This plan will address root causes to prevent gender-based violence and ensure that anyone facing GBV has reliable and timely access to protection and services, no matter where they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515662">However, our work does not stop there. We announced $22.4 million in new funding to organizations providing supports for at-risk populations, including survivors of violence, as part of the national strategy to combat human trafficking. In December, we announced our government's support for 63 organizations engaged in this work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515663"> We are also actively working to provide crucial support to those most vulnerable in the COVID-19 pandemic. We are providing up to $100 million in funding to shelters, sexual assault centres and other organizations working to support those experiencing GBV at this difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515664">We believe strongly that, by acting quickly, by listening to experts and advocates and by engaging all levels of government, working closely with our partners and by investing in the most sustainable approaches, we will be on track to end gender-based violence in all its forms.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515665">Madam Speaker, I am reminded of my experience in my first year of university during orientation. I was given a rape whistle. I was shown the dark paths not to go down and told stories of the women who had gone before me. Here is a thought: instead of arming women with rape whistles, and instead of removing responsibility from the perpetrators, how about we tell young women all the ways that we will support them and focus on their safety; that we will educate them and their classmates about consent; that, should any problems arise, they should contact authorities without hesitation; that we will believe them and that their offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515666">We do not say these things, and in many ways we cannot yet, because of the ongoing failures of our system. How about we also direct-fund organizations, particularly those supporting women fleeing domestic violence and those providing mental health services, meeting women with open doors instead of a lack of options? How about a guaranteed livable income, so that women are not financially dependent on their abusers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515667">I know that our generation has the power to put an end to gender-based violence. We require ongoing leadership and dedicated funding from the government to do it.</ParaText>

Since the early days of the pandemic last year, we have engaged over 1,000 individuals, representing organizations working in the GBV sector across the country, on priorities and the next steps on that plan. That plan is going to be devised by people working with all levels of government from the ground up. We know some people and populations in Canada are more likely to experience violence, and many are facing unique barriers and challenges that put them at particular risk of gender-based violence. That is why applying an intersectional lens to development of the national action plan continues to be at the heart of all of our efforts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515671">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to join the adjournment proceedings this evening to speak about an issue that we see reported in the papers today. That is the question of lobbying during this time when we have so much money flowing out from the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515672">Of course, helping Canadians is paramount during these unprecedented times. We need to make sure that we are getting funding to support individuals, families, seniors and people who are living in at-risk situations and are marginalized. We need to make sure we are supporting small and medium-sized businesses, and that the provinces have the funding they need to fulfill their health care obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515673">When the federal government spends money there are questions to ask. Who is keeping an eye on the cash that is leaving the register? Who is making sure that it is being done in a fair and transparent manner? Of course we have independent officers of Parliament who are given the responsibility to make sure that things are done in an ethical manner. We have our Ethics Commissioner. We have our Lobbying Commissioner as well. When requests or interventions are made, where people are looking to do business with the government or do business with Canadians on behalf of the government, there are rules that need to be followed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515674">We are going to see the WE scandal back in the news in the coming days as we have more witnesses testifying at the ethics committee. Of course, this is an issue born out of a situation where Canada's <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Canada's now former finance minister failed to recuse themselves from awarding a contract worth half a billion dollars to an organization that employed the immediate family members of the then finance minister and that had paid members of the Prime Minister's family half a million dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515675">If that is not enough to raise flags that perhaps there is a conflict of interest, or a need to recuse, or an obligation to consult the Lobbying Commissioner or the Ethics Commissioner, I am not sure what would. However, while originally we were told that nobody in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family was paid by the WE organization and the two could not be farther apart, we later learned that, of course, that was not true. Half a million dollars was paid to members of the Prime Minister's family. During its heavy lobbying of the government, the WE organization even included pictures of the Prime Minister's family working for them in its brief to the federal cabinet, just to make sure it sealed the deal and that everyone at the table knew who was who in the zoo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515676">Even today, we read in Blacklock's Reporter that a lobbyist with a group here in Ottawa had emailed the <Affiliation DbId="253382" Type="4">procurement minister's</Affiliation> office last March, seeking a contract for their son. The response from the minister's chief of staff was that she had vouched for the individual and forwarded the email for preferential treatment. Was that contact reported to the Lobbying Commissioner? I think colleagues know the answer to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515677">We have seen this pattern with the government. What we are looking for is transparency. We are looking to hear from the government if it will finally co-operate with the independent officers of Parliament, give them the unfettered access they need and waive cabinet confidences. That is what we are looking for. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515678">Madam Speaker, I always appreciate the exchanges my friend and I have, usually during the late shows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515679"> I do believe in transparency and accountability. There has been a great sense of that, especially during the change in government back in 2015, I would argue, when I was sitting on the opposition benches doing what he is doing: calling for more transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515680">It is interesting that when the member refers to WE, he tries to paint it as a wonderful, cozy relationship with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Government of Canada. This is the same WE organization that had contracts with the Province of Manitoba and Brian Pallister, who is a Progressive Conservative. I also believe the Province of Saskatchewan had contracts with the very same WE organization. I am sure my colleague across the way will have his research department filter that and find out if I am right. If am not right, I am sure he will come back to me on it. Even in my own home province, I believe it was more than just a one-time contract. It was becoming an annual type of contract. I do not know how many years it has been going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515681">The Conservatives want to give the impression that there is a buddy-buddy system between WE and the Liberal Party. The WE organization had other partners looked for support and supported other levels of government. I do not think it thought in terms of political affiliation, to the very best of my knowledge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515682">In terms of what I have witnessed, earlier today I was hoping that I would get the opportunity to share my thoughts at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. As I am sure the member is aware, there is a huge motion at PROC by the Conservatives saying that they want this, that and the other thing. I remember those arguments. Late last fall and even during the summertime, the opposition worked with the other opposition parties to paint a huge picture of evil. The Conservatives gave a lot of thought to how they could do this. At the end of the day, as much as they are being somewhat mischievous, as the member said and as I wrote down, helping Canadians is paramount, and that has been what this government has been focused on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515683">While my friend and his Conservative colleagues across the way continue to look under all the stones, this government's paramount focus has been on helping Canadians, recognizing just how important it is. He made reference to small businesses and to being there to support people, and the facts will clearly demonstrate that this government has done just that. I have argued in the past, since 2015, that the Conservative Party has had one focus, which is to give as much negative attention as humanly possible to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I have referred to it as character assassination. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515684">As much as they are focused on that, we continue to remain focused on Canadians. The last 12 months are probably the very best example I can cite, using some of the things my friend used: small businesses, the wage subsidy program, the emergency rent program, the emergency business account, the credit availability program, helping people through the CERB program, providing seniors the one-time payments and providing the one-time payment to people with disabilities. These are all initiatives that the government has focused its attention on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515685">We have spent billions and billions of dollars. The Conservatives joined us in unanimously supporting most of the legislation that was passed to spend that kind of money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515686">I suggest that when spending that kind of money, at times there could be—</ParaText>

I brought up the situation in my home province and city of Regina where 600 people at Evraz Steel had received layoff notices two weeks before Christmas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515697">The <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> answered my question. I said that in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s stop in Regina—Lewvan at Evraz Steel during the 2019 campaign, he told the workers “I have your back.” Lately, the men and women working at Evraz Steel are feeling left behind. Six hundred people were laid off. They spent their Christmas trying to figure out how they were going to pay the bills when they came due in 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515698">The <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s answer reflected no compassion, no concern for the people of Regina, the people I represent. She talked about trade deals. She patted herself on the back, saying how the government had a good trade deal with the United States. She blamed the Trump administration and then turned around and blamed our leader for those tariffs. There is always the opportunity to blame someone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515699">I know whoever is going to answer these questions today is going to say that we did not build any pipelines under former Prime Minister Harper. I am going to cut that off at the pass right now and talk about pipelines we did build during the Harper years. We built Anchor Loop, Keystone, Alberta Clipper, Line 9B reversal, Southern Lights and we approved energy east and northern gateway. Evraz Steel supplied most of the pipe for those projects. It added $1.25 billion barrels of oil into our system a day. Projects were done under former Prime Minister Harper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515700"> We still want to work toward getting our products to tidewater, so we can get the world prices instead of a discounted price. More work still needs to be done. When I ask questions about what the government will do to support our energy workers, our oil and gas workers, I have talked to the union and the men and women. They build pipes, but they consider themselves an oil and gas company. Without oil and gas production, pipelines are not needed. Therefore, I raise their concerns with those questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515701">I need the government members to take this more seriously, not just pat themselves on the back on a job that they think they have done well. They could work to do even better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515702"> What have the Liberals done in the last four months to ensure that jobs stay in Regina? Evraz is an important employer in Regina. One Evraz job creates four spinoff jobs in our local economy. It puts people to work in the restaurant sector, the hospitality sector. Companies that work with and have contracts with Evraz are hurting. There needs to be an effort by the government. I hope the Liberals listen and show some compassion for the people who want to work and earn a paycheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515703"> I hope I can get some answers tonight on initiatives that are being taken. I am not talking about CERB, or CEBA or programs because of COVID-19. I am talking about a real plan to secure the future jobs at Evraz and to ensure those jobs are there for generations to come.</ParaText>

This is the first generation that feels it will not have the opportunities into future that we have had. As public officials, we have to work to ensure those opportunities are there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515705">Madam Speaker, being from the Prairies, I spent a few years in Regina and still have family who call Regina home. I am very much sensitive to what happens in Regina. In fact, my brother was the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party for a few years. We had many different types of discussions about how important Saskatchewan and different sectors of the economy are, and we are very much concerned in the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515706">The member talks about putting aside COVID. Yes, the pandemic has had a very significant impact on the industry, but about one-third of those employed in the natural resource sectors were able to access the wage subsidy program. Literally hundreds if not thousands of jobs were saved because of some of the programs, but he wants me to shy away from the pandemic. I can respect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515707">The member made reference to pipelines and anticipated what I might say, so let me change things around. In the projects he is referencing, pipelines were not actually built to take our resources to the coast. That did not happen under Stephen Harper in his 10 years. That is happening under this administration. It got to a point where we even purchased a pipeline to ensure it was going to happen. There were lots of complications in regard to it, but we have to take into consideration environmental issues, indigenous issues and the different stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515708">We need a process in place that enables us to move the industry forward. I believe we have done this in a very responsible fashion. We are not just looking to export to the United States, for example. Everything Harper put down was for getting more oil there. I think 99% was going to the States prior to when Harper became the prime minister, and when he left it was the same percentage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515709">We need to look at ways to support the industry while respecting the importance of the environment and zero emissions. As I was commenting earlier today, the leadership coming from our energy sector regarding zero emissions is significant. I would argue that we are the best in the world in the ways we are improving upon our energy sector. We are second to no other country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515710">At the same time, the Canadian steel and aluminum industries are vital to our economy and provide employment in our communities across the country. In 2019, Canadian steel employed over 25,000 workers and contributed $3.8 billion to Canada's economy. In that same year, the Canadian aluminum industry employed approximately 10,000 workers and contributed $3.1 billion to our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6515711">We understand these are not just numbers. They represent families and communities that depend on these industries. Our government has, and always will, stand with Canadian workers and protect their interests.</ParaText>

He talked about the Harper years, which I knew he would talk about. I already said that we need to build pipelines to the coast. Only the member and the Liberal government would think they bought a pipeline so they could get it built. The private sector was going to build it. They just had to get out of the way, and they would not do that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6515719">Madam Speaker, our government has taken diligent action to complete things such as trade deals like CETA, securing and expanding market access for Canadian resource products, including steel and aluminum. In fact, in first 12 months that CETA was in force, aluminum exports to the Europe Union increased exponentially, up to 250%. These are significant things. To try to give a false impression that the Government of Canada is not being proactive to support the energy industry is just not true.<ForceColumnBreak /></ParaText>
