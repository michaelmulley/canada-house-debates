The petitioners point out that Canada has existing obligations under other human rights declarations that apply globally. They specifically point out the need to have a piece of legislation in Canada that brings the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into legal effect in this country, and to update our legislation to reflect Canada's obligations to enforce the rights of indigenous peoples in multiple situations. They specify the Wet'suwet'en territory and the conduct of the RCMP.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291648">On May 1 of this year, with the stroke of a pen, overnight, the Liberals, with their order in council, made hundreds of thousands of law-abiding citizens criminals. It had a catastrophic impact on sporting goods owners, like K.K.S Tactical Supplies and Cassandra Parker in my riding who, overnight, faced catastrophic losses to their business because of the inventory they had that they could no longer sell. It had no value.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291653">The petition states that the former Saint-Bruno firing range is a National Defence site measuring 4.5 km<Sup>2</Sup>. It has not been used for some time, it is in the process of being transferred, it is locked and monitored, and all recreational activities that used to take place there have been suspended. The site has mountain bike, cross-country ski and snowshoe trails that were established and groomed by volunteers in such a way as to respect protected areas set aside for the preservation of rare and endangered species. It also has soccer fields, which means it has tremendous recreational and tourism potential for the greater Montreal region. The petitioners are asking the Minister of National Defence to act quickly to transfer the site to a Quebec organization such as SÉPAQ or to a regional or municipal authority in order to protect it from real estate development and restore access to citizens for recreational purposes while respecting areas reserved for the preservation of protected species.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291654">Mr. Speaker, I would like to present a petition to Parliament that speaks to the sexual exploitation of children. The petition draws attention to this growing threat. It says that our children are being exposed to pornography online, their health can be threatened, with some addicted to pornography, some producing and distributing pornography, some performing sexual assaults on other children, some planning suicides online and some planning violent acts to public safety online. The petition says that our parents, caregivers and professionals require increased education, and that the Government of Canada should support the efforts of the federal Canadian charity Internet Sense First and its anti-Internet child exploitation team's goal of the education of Canadians regarding the theory of digital supervision for proactive online child protection.</ParaText>

Many studies have been conducted to show that upload speeds and download speeds are exceptionally poor. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, with businesses operating from home and children having to do some of their schooling at home, they call on the Government of Canada to make broadband Internet service an essential telecommunications service.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291656">Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. The first is from members of my riding who were very concerned when the House of Commons was shut down. They indicated that the House of Commons should be considered an essential service to Canada. They said that limiting the business of the House of Commons, along with matters concerning the COVID pandemic, inhibited the ability of members of Parliament to hold the government to account, virtual meetings were insufficient, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s daily press availability was not an effective forum for holding him accountable and unprecedented levels of public spending were hurried. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291657">A return to normal in-person sittings of the House of Commons and its standing committees is needed. This took place during the months prior to the actual prorogation by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The 13,346 petitioners call upon the Prime Minister to immediately reconvene the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291658">Mr. Speaker, the second petition is in regard to sex-selective abortion. It indicates that sex-selective abortion is legal in Canada because there are no laws, yet sex selection is antithetical to equality between men and women that we promote as a nation. A 2019 DART &amp; Maru/Blue poll indicated 84% of Canadians believe that it should be illegal to have an abortion if a family does not want a child because of its sex. International organizations including the World Health Organization, United Nations Women and United Nations Children's Fund have all identified unequal sex ratios at birth as a growing problem internationally. Canada's own health care professionals recognize sex selection as a problem here. The petitioners call upon the House of Commons to pass a Criminal Code prohibition of sex selection abortion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291731">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> is right. In March we did work all together. In fact, I had calls with several ministers recommending solutions. I was in a leadership race that I asked to be suspended. I know his party, and all parties, tried to get solutions for Canadians in the midst of a pandemic. We know the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised testing and tracing in March that has not been delivered. As the member said, on April 8, the government promised students something that was not delivered, and then worked with its friends to create a program that appeared to be quid pro quo in the midst of a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291732"> I am sure the member agrees. We hope the NDP will work with us because we are changing the name of the committee based on its recommendation. We have many of the same questions he had. What was terrible was even in a pandemic with no Parliament sitting, there was one line for Liberal insiders and friends of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and one line for students, front-line health care workers and all other Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291735">Our objective today is to enable all parliamentary committees to continue their meaningful work of oversight during the pandemic and to create a committee that will directly address the current government's unfortunate and irresponsible spending decisions during the pandemic and other decisions that may unfortunately be made. This is why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291736">The leader of the official opposition moved this motion, but traditionally, the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> does not move motions on supply days. MPs are generally the ones who do so. However, our leader decided to move this motion because this is an important matter and Canadians need representatives in Parliament who do their jobs and who can oversee the government's actions, department by department, in parliamentary committees and in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291737">We want to hold the government accountable for its management of public money during the pandemic. Unfortunately, this government has made some highly improper and wrongful spending decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291738">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was very excited about playing Santa Claus, as he gave his little daily updates at 11:15 a.m. in May, June and even July, outside his residence. He announced hundreds of millions of dollars, billions even, in assistance to anything in Canada that moved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291739">What else did we see? We saw that the Liberal government was also prepared to spend nearly $1 billion to help Liberal Party cronies and friends of the Prime Minister's family.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291740">This is what we are talking about this morning. We are talking about the misjudgment of the government when it comes to spending money. It spent nearly $1 billion to help a company close to the Liberal Party and close to the family of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6291741">Nearly $900 million was involved in the WE Charity scandal. As was mentioned earlier, that organization had no roots in Quebec and barely had a made-up French name. It was the furthest thing from a Canada-wide organization. It was exclusive to English Canada, if not to Toronto, if not to the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291742">Through the questions we asked at parliamentary committees, we managed to pull the cat out of the bag and quickly realized that the Liberals were in fact trying help the friends of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. I cannot use the word “lie” in the House, but the Liberal version of events underwent a series of changes, which we will politely call an evolution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291743">First we were told that there was absolutely no connection between WE Charity and the Liberal Party, and that the Prime Minister's family had never been hired by this organization, but that is totally false. Then we were told they were paid only for travel expenses, but that is completely false. Just yesterday, we found out that some of the figures reported by WE Charity at the committee meetings did not line up with the truth. That is why we must have a committee that will focus specifically on the Liberals' mismanagement of public finances. The situation with WE Charity was not unique. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291744">What future does the government have in store for us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291745">If the past is any indication, we parliamentarians must be especially vigilant to make sure that the billions of dollars Canadians pay every year in taxes to the federal government are well managed. That is our job. It is funny: We are here to ask Parliament for permission to do our job.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291746">The Conservatives are here to tell the government and Parliament that we want to do our job. We need to do our job; we have to do our job. This is why we are here today. We are asking the government to allow all parliamentarians do their job. When I say that, I am also talking about the Liberal members of Parliament. They also have questions to ask of the government, because unfortunately what we saw this summer was a government saying one thing and then, after being asked more questions, saying sorry that it forgot about other things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291747">Let us talk about Bill Morneau, who forgot to pay $41,000. Who could believe that? I can tell members that I would always have in mind that I owe more than $40,000. This is what we have seen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291748">We saw the Minister of Finance resign. We saw the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogue the House to prevent parliamentarians from doing their job. We saw the government table 5,000 pages of documents, a full quarter of them redacted. This is not what Canadians want, and that is why we must conduct this valid investigation, which is key to our work as parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291749">In our opinion, it is essential that ethics be at the heart of what we do, and that public funds be spent appropriately. What do we have on the table today? We have a motion that will allow us to focus exclusively on managing these issues so that other committees can work on the pandemic and the House can do what it is meant to do. The oral question period always starts with questions about the pandemic, and that is how it should be. However, a committee would allow us to precisely manage that pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291750">We introduced this motion on the Order Paper, as is the custom, last Thursday. Now all parliamentarians are aware of our goals, our intentions and what we want to do. Then, the Liberal government came along with a strange proposal, to say the least. They want to create a committee that will do the bare minimum in certain areas to avoid directly addressing the root of the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291751">The government would like the committee to be chaired by a member of the government. I have considerable respect for all of my friends in Parliament, whether they be Liberal, Bloc Québécois, New Democrat, Green, independent or Conservative. In the past year, we have seen how the Liberals are working on behalf of the Liberal Party rather than for the good of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291752">A few weeks ago, the House and the committees began sitting virtually. The Standing Committee on Finance was one of them. We saw the committee’s Liberal chair try to suspend the committee’s work by placing his thumb on his webcam. I have never seen anything so ridiculous in my life. I have considerable respect for that person. I will not name him because I have too much respect for him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291753">Good gracious, that is what is going on in our committees now. The Liberals are filibustering and reading newspaper articles to prevent us from having real parliamentary committee debates. A chair put his thumb in front of his webcam to put an end to the sitting. Just imagine if I tried to put my thumb in front of the camera to adjourn the House. It is ridiculous, but that is what the Liberals did to prevent the hon. member from <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> from doing what he was supposed to be doing in the parliamentary committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291754">Let us be serious. Rather than conduct a careful study, the Liberal government is proposing that this be done in four weeks. Four weeks is not enough. Arbitrary suspensions, obstruction, adjournments and cancelled meetings, that is what the Liberals have served up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291755">For the past two days, the Liberals have been hinting that if this motion is adopted, the government could trigger a general election. How irresponsible. How absolutely outrageous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291756">I am sorry to say that, but when we talk about an election we talk about serious business. It is not the time to play chicken on this issue, even if the House of Commons is the best place to talk about that. “Some chicken, some neck,” as we heard on December 30, 1941, here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291758">As far as management of public funds is concerned, the Liberals are prepared to trigger an election to prevent parliamentarians from doing their work. That way of thinking is unworthy of a parliamentarian, but it is typical of the Liberals.

              <ParaText id="6291790">Fifth, the Conservative motion is just proposing more political games. It is not a serious effort to examine all the areas of pandemic spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291791">Sixth, Canadians want their politicians to work together in this pandemic, not throw mud at each other.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291793">Eighth, we do not want an election. Canadians do not want an election. We have important legislation before the House, including MAID, conversion therapy and sexual assault training for judges, and legislation upcoming on wage subsidy, rent support and the Canada emergency business account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291794">Finally, I would hope all parties will work with us in support of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291795">I wanted to highlight these items, prior to my responding to some of the things I have heard from both the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="263909" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation>, because I think they are really important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291796">To start, the leader says we need to evaluate why we are here in the first place. I would suggest the leader is right. We are here in this House because Canadians have bestowed upon us their trust and confidence. When I say “we”, I am referring to every member of Parliament, no matter what side of the House they sit on. Each and every one of us has a responsibility to our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291797"> If the Conservatives were to consult, as we have been and as, I believe, most members of Parliament have been with their constituents, they would find the number one concern facing our country today is the coronavirus. What we can do collectively in order to fight the coronavirus and protect the health and well-being of Canadians, while at the same time protecting our economy, is the priority in Canada today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291798">What we hear, day in and day out, from the Conservative Party is the issue with WE. Opposition members want to say it is this huge mountain of corruption. I have been in opposition for many years, and boy they sure can make something look awfully big. I would suggest that, in comparison with other administrations, it is very minimal. It is something a committee could deal with along with all the other things that are done at the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291799">The <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> said to reflect. I suggest that Conservative members of Parliament need to realize that the track they took in 2015 of character assassinations of politicians on the government side is wrong. I suggest that they put that on hold and start dealing with what our constituents want us to deal with, and that is fighting the pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291800"> What is interesting is that, whether they are in non-profit organizations or governments of different levels, indigenous people or private individuals, people across our country not only recognize but also understand the importance of working together. The only group of people that seems to be so focused on being a destructive force is the Conservative Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291801">For example, its members talk about WE. The leader said WE is an extension of the Liberal Party. Let me tell the leader of the Conservative Party that the WE organization got an annual grant from the Manitoba government. The last time I looked, the Manitoba government was a Progressive Conservative government. That was an annual grant. That is hard to believe based on what the leader of the Conservative party has been saying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291802">My job is not to defend WE. My job is to assure Canadians that, as much as the Conservative Party is so bloody focused on this issue, we are going to remain focused on the priority of Canadians, which is to combat the pandemic. We will work with those who want to work with us, and the list is endless, to ensure we are doing what is absolutely essential to protect the health and well-being of Canadians from coast to coast to coast, while at the same time working on our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291803">I have made reference in the past to what we have been able to do by working with Canadians. We have come up with some wonderful things out of nothing. On the other hand, the Conservatives criticize and black-mark our civil servants, yet it was those civil servants who put together and created the CERB program, which assisted millions of Canadians in every region of our country. It is the credibility of many of those same civil servants that is being called into question by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291804"> In part, they are the same civil servants who put together programs such as the wage subsidy program. By listening to what members of Parliament from different political parties said, including many people from opposition parties, regarding the importance of our seniors, they developed programs that would assist our seniors. We have done that in different ways, such as a one-time payment to the GIS and OAS, which are retirement programs. I am especially proud of the GIS, which is for the poorest seniors in our country. We recognize the importance of and the need for additional expenditures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291805">This is the type of thing we should be talking about inside the House of Commons. The Conservatives want to make a change here. I hope they are not going to hoodwink our friends in the New Democratic Party, who have been very critical of the many government ideas and programs we have brought forward. I will not take that away from them. That is part of what they and the Conservatives should be doing as the opposition, which is to look for ways the government can improve the system and take advantage of the opportunity to communicate with ministers during a pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291806">I find this motion, which I would classify as a confidence motion, to be amazing. The Conservatives should look at the details and read it thoroughly. It will take quite a while to read, because it is a very lengthy motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291807">This all goes back to what it is the Conservatives have been up to for the last five years. They may as well not have had a change of leadership, because it is almost as if Stephen Harper is still here.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291808">At the end of the day, the Conservative Party needs to get on track. It needs to put less attention on some issues and more attention on this issue, the issue of the pandemic. We are now well into the second wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291809">I made reference to organizations. I had discussions with Folklorama, an organization I am very proud of. It is such an economic driver for the city of Winnipeg. It is an organization that really amplifies and embodies Canada's diversity. It does so much good for my city, and in fact, our country. It is the longest running multicultural ethnic event of this nature in North America, and someone once said to me of the world, which I suspect could be the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291810">Folklorama has now been going on for over 50 years, but not this year. This year we did not have those two weeks of celebration of diversity, with displays of culture and heritage, entertainment in the forms of dance and song, or the gathering of hundreds of thousands of people in the city of Winnipeg to appreciate our diversity. The reason for that was the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291811">The Government of Canada, through the wage subsidy program, was able to assist Folklorama. This is one organization. Some of its members said they were not sure if it would be able to survive this year because of the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291812">Another great program is 211. We finally have a national 211 program in Canada because of funding that in part came from Ottawa. Obviously it is also the United Way and some wonderful people. I think of Ms. Walker in particular, who did a fantastic job in advocating for 211. Now there is an Internet presence, and most importantly, a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week phone line that can be accessed from anywhere in Canada, from what I understand. By calling 211, people can access all sorts of different programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291813">Those are the types of things having a positive impact on real people in all of our communities. I remember months ago talking with the United Way about the program and how important it was to try to incorporate it to its fullest extent in the province of Manitoba. I was so pleased the other week when we finally saw it come to fruition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291814">There are endless examples of small businesses that are here today because of the support they received from the government. I reference the CERB program. Disposable income that Canadians rely on day in, day out is absolutely critical. That particular program, which came from nowhere and is a direct result of the pandemic, was there for over eight million Canadians. It allowed them to purchase the groceries they needed. It allowed them to get the things that were important to their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291815">On co-operation and recognizing how important the pandemic is, we have been working with provinces. I believe the amount was over $19 billion for the safe restart program. The Government of Canada worked with provincial and territorial jurisdictions in order to ensure we have in place what is important to help us all get through a second wave.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291816">Liberals understand, and I like to think most members of Parliament understand, why we need to be here. We get criticized for proroguing the session. Let me remind members that there was an agreement by the majority of the House when we rose earlier this year that we would come back on September 23. We had agreed to that. We also agreed that we would sit, albeit in committee of the whole, on the floor of the House during the summer. We would have to go back to 1988 to find the last time the House of Commons sat in July and August.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291817">When we were sitting here, I had never before witnessed the opportunity for opposition parties to contribute to policy development for the Government of Canada, never. They had the opportunity not just to ask one question and a supplementary question. They had five-minute slots. We were going for well over two hours, during which hundreds of questions were being asked by opposition and government members of ministers to try to influence policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291818">There were more days that we sat in the summer than we lost because of prorogation. Prorogation is utilized, even in the province of Manitoba. Here is a bit of hypocrisy. How can a Conservative member of Parliament criticize proroguing a session, especially if the member is from Manitoba, when the Manitoba government prorogued its session? Go figure. Yes, there is a pandemic in Manitoba, too. It is across Canada. Yes, WE does get money from the Province of Manitoba, too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291819">The point is that the Conservatives will do whatever they can to twist things. The <Affiliation DbId="263909" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> said the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been investigated by the commissioner more than any other prime minister. We hear that every so often. It was Stephen Harper who established the commissioner. How stupid a comment from the Conservative Party saying the Prime Minister is the worst.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291820">I have far more faith in the commissioner than I do in the official opposition, far more faith, the reason being that the Conservatives obviously have a bias. They have demonstrated that bias since the day after the Liberals were elected five years ago, five years plus a day. Five years ago, the Conservatives started their character assassination and they have not stopped since. Why should people believe what the Conservative Party has to say on the issue of corruption?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291821">Do members recall the Senate scandal during the Stephen Harper government? Do they know how many people were linked to the PMO during the Senate scandal? That is where there was a payout. If we really think about it, the commissioner is there to ensure that the political partisanship we see from the Conservative Party is put to the side and we stick to the facts. The facts on that issue are that it was public civil servants who made the recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291822">I see my time has expired. I would ask for leave to continue, but I expect the Conservatives would not want this continual barrage of reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291823">At the end of the day, I am hopeful that members will see the Conservative interference in the House of Commons, which is having a negative impact on Liberals being able to do what we need to do with regard to fighting the coronavirus that is impacting every region of our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291827">However, on his idea that focusing and asking questions about this corruption scandal is somehow doing Canadians a disservice, the member is missing the point.

              <Affiliation DbId="252623" Type="2">Mr. Yves-François Blanchet (Beloeil—Chambly, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6291858">Mr. Speaker, you nearly caught me off guard because it is my oldest son's birthday, so I was thinking about something for him. However, I will get back to these very serious matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291859">We are debating a motion, moved by the Conservatives, based on a principle that we support right off the bat, that is, to shed light on the key issues that smack of scandal that accumulated during the second term of this Liberal government led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252780" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation>. The desire to call out this government is undeniable, but this is more about getting to the bottom of these issues and the errors in judgment that keep piling up one on top of the other. This needs to happen. However, it might also be appropriate to suggest areas of reflection, possible solutions, improvements and ways to tighten things up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291860">What we would have liked is not to allow the government to sweep the WE affair under the rug by proroguing Parliament, changing the subject, and coming back with a throne speech which essentially had no substance and which should be followed by some hopefully meaningful economic measures. I have to say, so far, it has worked relatively well. The WE affair is much less in the news than it was before Parliament was prorogued, but that is unacceptable, because Quebeckers and Canadians cannot remain in the dark and ignorant about so important an issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291861">Seeing what was coming, the Liberals strategically decided to introduce a motion that was essentially intended to sidestep the problem. The Liberals decided to introduce a motion that would address all of the financial issues relating to the pandemic, but these are two entirely different things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291862">The fact is that the Canadian government committed hundreds of millions of dollars to fight the effects of the pandemic. We are up to around $325 billion. That is one thing. It certainly deserves a careful examination by Parliament, which is tasked with protecting the interests, in particular the financial interests, of Quebeckers and Canadians. However, the government’s unacceptable ethical behaviour is quite another thing. These are repeated and serious instances of misconduct, of which this is one example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291863">It seems that the Prime Minister wanted to help a friendly, albeit not-for-profit, organization, an organization that had such serious governance issues that the directors were resigning in droves, an organization that awarded $250,000 in contracts to the Prime Minister’s mother, some $30,000 to his brother and tens of thousands of dollars in expenses to his wife. The former minister of finance benefited from $41,000 in trips. In a sort of admission in which he did not want to admit that he was admitting anything, the Prime Minister threw his finance minister under the bus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291864">We agree, and we immediately said so to avoid having the exercise turn into a mudslinging contest. The Prime Minister’s family is not politically active. We respect that. Now, we need to shed light on the matter. I am not saying that it was one rather than the other, but we immediately agreed with the principle because my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252688" Type="2">Rivière-du-Nord</Affiliation> also made a proposal similar to the one in this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291865">With dramatic flair, the Liberals finally decided that they were going to force a confidence vote. I will say right away that they have probably already finagled and squirrelled away the NDP’s vote, but one has to keep up appearances. They will have to say that they acted correctly in the WE affair. Otherwise, there will be a general election. The entire exercise is ridiculous, because we do not believe it for a second.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291866">However, if the Liberal government thinks it is a good time for it to call an election, we do not. If the Prime Minister thinks it is a good idea for strategic reasons, and if he is so afraid of what a more in-depth investigation will show, let him grow a spine, even if that is not his specialty, or let him go see his pal the Governor General and call an election. He should not try to blame his own strategic calculations on the legitimate opposition parties, whose members were elected just as the government’s members were. A spine is a good thing to have. We can lend him one.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291867">There is something truly distasteful about this challenge. The government is asking us to condone inexcusable behaviour, to say it was all okay. Otherwise, it will call an election. It wants to blackmail Parliament so that it can be cleared of all serious ethical misconduct. Quebeckers are honest and intelligent people. My response to the government’s blackmail is, “Don’t even think it!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291868">We intended to vote with the Conservatives on this motion, and we will vote with the Conservatives. If the agreement between the Liberals and the NDP still stands after that, the Liberals will remain in power. If not, we will find ourselves in the middle of an election campaign. For those who do not think it is a good idea, that is the Liberals’ problem. It is their choice, their fault, and they will have to bear the responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291869">Clearly the system does not work very well when it comes to ethics. The Prime Minister was given a trip worth about $50,000 as a gift from his friend the Aga Khan. He broke the rules and intervened directly in a matter under the responsibility of the Department of Justice. Remember that we are in the age of “Liberalist, part A.” In fact, today we have the “Liberalist, part B,” which tell us that, if someone wants to be appointed a judge, they will be better off planting a Liberal Party sign on their lawn or writing a $15 cheque to the Party than having a distinguished legal career. We have had enough. These decisions must be based on fair, relevant and helpful criteria that serve the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291870">Obviously, there is the WE Charity. There is also—some may have forgotten this—the wage subsidy and the fact that the Liberal Party pocketed some $800,000 earmarked for struggling businesses. The businesses are still struggling, and the Liberals still have not paid back the $800,000. I must point out that the Conservatives have given back what they took. We in the Bloc Québécois never even applied for the subsidy, because we are funded by citizens who believe that what we do is fair, good and legitimate, including striving for independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291871">Lastly, let us recall—we forget this all too often as well, although it is perhaps the most important example—that the spouse of the Prime Minister’s chief of staff is vice-president of a company that was awarded an $84-million contract. That is a lot, but, for reasons I cannot understand, it has not garnered much interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291872">In any case, it directly implicates the Prime Minister or the PMO. The system is not working. We are faced with the classic Liberal arrogance, the belief that power belongs, almost by divine right, to the Liberals. It is not surprising that Canada is still hung up on the monarchy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291873">However, our system does not work that way. Power belongs to the electorate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291874">Therefore, we have the following situation. On at least five occasions, the Prime Minister or members of his immediate entourage made serious ethical mistakes. The Prime Minister gets away with it by shedding a tiny tear that would not even wet the corner of a tissue before moving on to something else. Life is good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291875">That makes no sense. We therefore thought that the Ethics Commissioner should be given some teeth. His decisions have to smart, they have to hurt. They have to give pause to those who lack the good sense to do the right thing for the right reason. If that means they must be punished by sending them to the corner and taking away their dessert, that is what we will do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291876">I do not wish to present legislation to Parliament, because we are not at that point, but I do have some food for thought. I present to the House for its considered judgment four ideas that we could debate quickly, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that it is possible to act quickly when there is the will to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291877">First, when the mistake is quantifiable and the individual is found to be at fault, the value of the mistake must be automatically repaid. For example, the Prime Minister was pleased that the finance minister repaid $41,000, and yet, the Prime Minister owes $50,000. Let's start with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291878"> If the Ethics Commissioner finds someone at fault, they can use their discretion and impose a fine of up to $10,000. That will give pause.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291879">The Ethics Commissioner could recommend fines above $10,000 to Parliament, which is completely sovereign. Parliament would vote on whether to approve that fine. The Ethics Commissioner could also recommend that Parliament temporarily suspend the parliamentary privileges of any member found at fault. The higher the member is in the hierarchy, the higher the standard they are held to. The pyramid is currently reversed, and the highest level is the worst.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291880">Lastly, immediate family members, such as children, spouses, parents, and siblings, would be considered the same as the member of Parliament, in terms of ethics. There would no longer be any distinction between the two. If this were enforced retroactively, it would obviously sting some people. That is not what I am asking for. I want us to think of this as a way to issue penalties that are serious enough that even the worst examples, and I will not name any since I am not allowed to under the Standing Orders, will have to think twice, even though that does not seem like a house specialty. If these rules had been around in 2015, I think the Prime Minister would have thought twice. If he wants to trigger an election, I think he should also think twice.</ParaText>

No. We wanted to defend our position and condemn a throne speech that was an insult to Quebec for a thousand and one good reasons, rather than condone it by voting for it.

Is it better to allow His Majesty the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to do whatever he wants, however he wants and whenever he wants, to the detriment and at the expense of Quebeckers and Canadians, or is it better to say that he needs to be taught a lesson?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291887">That is the fundamental question. If management improves afterwards, and if, supposing he is re-elected, someone is there to give him a rap on the knuckles and tell him that he can be replaced, that might not be a bad thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291912">We are currently in the midst of an unprecedented economic and health crisis. The pandemic has disrupted our economy. This morning, the Liberal government declared its intent to plunge Canada into an election to avoid questions about the WE Charity scandal and the Prime Minister's family. That is not acceptable. The government must stop shutting down committees and start collaborating with the other parties to explain the WE Charity scandal to Canadians. That is why I am here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291915">Who said that? It was our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in 2011. Remember that man? That man was open by default. He was the man who told the Canadian people that his would be the government of transparency. That was around the time the Prime Minister was the youth critic for the Liberal Party. He fessed up that while he was the youth critic, he had a side gig of charging massive amounts of money to speak to young people for his private business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291916">It was fascinating when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had to explain how much money he was making running his side business while acting as a member of Parliament. He listed about 28 public speaking events. I thought it was pretty extraordinary to get paid $10,000 to talk to young people when every member of the House does it for free because we believe it is our job. However, we found out yesterday in the release of documents that, no, our Prime Minister did not speak 28 times and get paid for it; it was more like 128 times. We just found that out yesterday because the government was forced to turn over documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291917">We are here because of a series of decisions, made at the cabinet level by senior Liberal politicians, that threw off so much of the good work and goodwill in the first wave of the pandemic. I remember those first frightening days in March, when we did not know what was happening and our offices were dealing with Canadians who were trapped all over the world trying to get home. We were trying to answer questions on COVID, and every morning our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood out in front of his house and reassured the Canadian people. Every morning in my home we stopped what we were doing to listen to our Prime Minister speak. I was so proud that in Canada we were showing a unity of spirit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291918"> I remember the press conference on April 8, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> responded to pressure that the New Democrats had been putting on him to deal with the crisis facing university students. Post-secondary students are not only facing massive levels of student debt from years of Liberal and Conservative indifference. They also have huge loans because of the fees they have to pay for university. They knew they had no work coming up this summer, so the ability of post-secondary students to continue their studies was a serious issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291919">We heard from some Conservative media people too. They wondered: Are we going to pay students so they can sit in a hammock and smoke pot all summer? What disrespect for students, who are coming out of university with $50,000 or $100,000 of debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291920">We pushed the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for action, and on April 8 he said very clearly that he would have a plan to help university students. It was a promise, and we are going to get into what happened between April 8 and April 22, when the Prime Minister and his team decided that instead of helping university students across Canada, they would help their friends the Kielburgers. I say this because when the scandal broke and it became clear that the money that should have gone to help university students was being diverted to a group that had close financial ties to the Prime Minister's family, Canadians from coast to coast balked.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291921">What did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> do? He pulled that money. None of that money ever flowed. He took that money away from university students, who deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291922">What we are being told today, after the Liberals prorogued and shut down our committees, after two weeks of blocking our work at the ethics and finance committees, is that the Liberals are ready to plunge this nation into an election. We are in the worst medical and economic crisis in a century. The second wave of this pandemic is already much more serious than the first. We have much more insecurity economically right now, yet this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is willing to plunge the nation into the uncertainty of an election when we know that the vectors for the virus could easily be magnified a thousand times by polling and people going door to door, and having to do the jobs of a democratic election, but also leaving Canada without any leadership for the coming three months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291923">Why is that? It is to avoid giving answers about the WE scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291924">We are here this morning because the Conservatives put their offer on the table. We had gone to the government and said that we needed to get focused. The government cannot continue to avoid questions on the WE scandal and the misspending that happened, and we need to get answers. We cannot have our committees prorogued. We cannot have them filibustered. We asked, in good faith, to set up a committee where we could deal with this so that the finance committee could do its work, House procedures could do its work and ethics could do its work. Boy oh boy, I would love to be sitting at the ethics committee and looking at issues like the importance of getting legislation on facial recognition technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291925">We reached out to the Liberals and said, “Let us get a committee in place.” The Liberals said they would get us a committee. It would be chaired by Liberals and dominated by Liberals. The Liberals would then get to do what they do at all the other committees they do not like: They would just monkey-wrench them and shut them down. That is not going to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291926">Now the Conservatives have come forward with their anti-corruption motion. As always with the Conservatives, they cannot just come forward with a motion that is something that will pass the nod test with Canadians. Not only was it called the anti-corruption motion, and now they are having to walk that back, but the Conservatives had to start naming a bunch of people who have never actually been charged with corruption. Frank Baylis, a former member of Parliament, sat on the ethics committee with me. I know Frank. I do not know anything about Frank's business, and I do not know if Frank has done anything corrupt. That is something to be found out. However, I find it very uncomfortable when I see people's names being thrown around just because they happen to be Liberals. We can do better than that. The Conservatives have a motion on the table, and it is a very serious motion. We need to get this work done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291927">Of course, there is actually a third option, which the New Democrats have put forward. It is trying to get, between these two old-line parties, a sense of responsibility in the middle of a pandemic: that we have a committee that has the ability to call for documents. That is unlike the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation>, who said that calling for documents would put thousands of civil servants at risk in the middle of a pandemic. Wow. I have heard a lot of whoppers over the years in the House of Commons, but that is going to rank up there in my top 10 favourites: the right of parliamentarians to get documents is somehow putting not hundreds, but thousands, at risk. We are saying no: that another committee, if it is struck, has the right to get documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291928">We agree that perhaps the Conservatives demanding that all the documents be turned over in 12 hours, or 15 or 20, is kind of ridiculous. A committee can decide what is reasonable. We also said that given the fact that we saw, under SNC-Lavalin, how the Liberal chair did such an extraordinary job of shutting it down and squashing it, we cannot trust a Liberal chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291929">Now I can see that the Conservatives are very wary of our friend from <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> who keeps taking over the chair at his own committee. They probably do not want that either. Therefore, let us have an opposition chair and let us vote on it. Let us vote on someone who all parties can agree would be a good, solid opposition chair. That way we would know that we could get the job done. That is about working together. That is the offer that is on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291930">In terms of the documents, we have made a number of suggestions. For example, at the ethics committee I put a motion of an amendment to my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation>. We said we understand the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has drawn a line in the sand about his family, and the fact that the WE group was paying Margaret and Sacha Trudeau.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291931">We know they got paid. There is no surprise there. We were told they were not paid. That was false. The WE group asked the Kielburgers if the Trudeau family was being paid and was told they were not being paid. We have to ask ourselves what was going on at WE Charity that the board of directors tried to find out whether Margaret and Sacha were being paid and was falsely told they were not being paid. We went from being told they were not being paid anything to being told they were paid an extraordinary amount of money. That is a key issue in terms of the overall question of the conflict of interest facing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, because my colleagues in the Liberal party have gone out of their way to try and read the Conflict of Interest Act to say that family members, such as a mother or brother, cannot be shown in any way under the laws of Canada to be relatives. That is quite the reading, because it is very clear in section 3, and the definitions of family and relatives, that they are relatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291932">Why does that matter? Because under section 5 of the Conflict of Interest Act, it is up to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to keep his personal life in order so that he is not put into a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291933">I invite my colleagues to read the Trudeau 1 report. It was the family members' relations with the Aga Khan, not the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s, that resulted in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> being found guilty. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s familial connections to WE are very important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291934">Does this mean the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew what the family was making? I do not think so. I do not think we can make that leap, but what we could say is there is a very strong prima facie case that, once the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> became the Prime Minister of this nation, the WE group was extremely adept at insinuating itself within the Liberal ranks by hiring the mother and hiring the brother. The Kielburgers told us they were not being paid to do public speaking: they were being paid to do corporate events, which they call ancillary events. That is a serious issue, in the same way as the Kielburger group insinuated itself by inviting all kinds of key Liberal cabinet ministers to participate, and when the WE group was in trouble it called those same people who had spoken at its WE events and got the all-access pass. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291935">Having said that, we know Margaret Trudeau and Sacha Trudeau were paid. To me, that is not the hill to die on. The government has released a whole bunch of documents about the payments already. We have that. Whether they got paid 27 times or 28 times is not relevant to me. What is relevant is the issue of lobbying, so let us put that aside. We said that at ethics. We were more than willing to say at ethics not to deal with the family, but with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Then the Liberals talked the clock out, so I really do not know what their strategy is half the time, because we could have gotten this motion through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291936">The issue of documents is really important. My colleagues in the Conservatives are demanding documents and saying they do not have enough documents. We have 5,000 pages of documents. Our friend from <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> came in, threw them all over the room and walked out. Five thousand pages of documents was so much that the Conservatives set up a website and asked the public to do crowdsourced reading of the documents for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291937">How serious are the Conservatives? Either we are going to read these documents and take them seriously or we are not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291938">While the Conservatives threw the documents all over and stomped out and then asked for public help reading the documents, we sat down and read the documents. Those documents raised very serious questions, because they clearly contradicted the government line, where it threw the civil service under the bus time and time again. It is still throwing the civil service under the bus. It is trying to claim that it was the idea of the civil service: the non-partisan, professional civil service. The <Affiliation DbId="253404" Type="4">Minister of Youth</Affiliation> said 23 times, in one hour at hearing, that the professional, non-partisan civil service came up with the WE idea. The Liberals said it was the professional, non-partisan civil service that blacked out these documents. That is not true. This was done in the PMO. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291939">What do the documents show us? They show that it was not the civil service that came forward with this idea. This happened at an April 17 meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="253404" Type="4">Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth</Affiliation>, the Kielburgers and WE's director of government relations, Ms. Sofia Marquez.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291940">WE is not registered to lobby, but it has a director of government relations. In fact, it had more meetings with government officials than General Motors did. That is pretty wild for two guys who present themselves as young idealists from Thornhill. They were so busy with government relations that, on top of their director of government relations, they were going to hire a manager for government relations, and none of that was registered under the Lobbying Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291941">Why is that important? It is because the Lobbying Act allows us to see the key meetings that are being held. It allows us to see where the insiders are moving, but the Kielburger group were such total insiders that they did not bother to register to lobby, because they had the key ministers on speed dial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291942">They had the <Affiliation DbId="253404" Type="4">Minister for Diversity and Youth</Affiliation>, who they had invited to come to one of their WE events, where she got to speak and was treated like royalty. When they were in financial free fall, they called her and had a special meeting on April 17. My Conservative colleague asked the minister at the finance committee, at our very first meeting on the WE scandal, if she had taken any meetings with anyone from WE prior to the decision by the government. She said that she never discussed the youth engagement proposal with anyone from WE. Naively, we thought she was telling the truth. We found out four days later she had held the April 17 meeting, so we brought her to the ethics committee and tried to get a straight answer. She said again that she never discussed the youth engagement proposal. That is because on April 17 the youth engagement proposal did not exist. It did not exist until April 22.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291943">She said that she never talked about any of the issues around it, but that is not what we got from the documents from Craig Kielburger. That is not what we got from Sofia Marquez. Craig Kielburger wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="253404" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and said, “We appreciate your thoughtful offer to connect us with the relevant members of your ministry.... Over the weekend, our team has also been hard at work to adapt your suggestions for a second stream focused on a summer service opportunity.” That minister still has her seat at cabinet after the misrepresentation she made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291944">On the morning of April 19, two days after that meeting, Rachel Wernick, the civil servant we have been told came up with this idea and who has been blamed again and again by the Liberals, emailed Craig Kielburger for an urgent meeting because she had been told that this was the direction to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291945">On April 20, senior policy officials in Bill Morneau's office were involved. There is a man who had one of the most powerful positions in the country. He never bothered to read the Conflict of Interest Act, and he wonders why he does not have a job today. I asked him if he had read the Conflict of Interest Act, as he had been found guilty, and he shrugged and said he was given a lot of documents. It is the failure of the Liberals to take the issue of conflict seriously that has gotten them into trouble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291946">We are here today as the Liberals have taken yet another step to avoid accountability. We have offered to work with them and have offered to lay out a committee, but this work will continue. This work will get done. If they obstruct us here, we will continue at the committees that we can control and in which we can use our leverage, because Canadians need an answer. What Canadians need, in terms of an answer, is better than the threat of the government to force an election for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to escape taking accountability.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291962">Madam Speaker, one of the arguments made by the Liberals in response to this motion is that this is not the time to look into corruption because of the current pandemic. The government can cite the pandemic as the reason for the blockages at the border, immigration, Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency and so forth, but it is completely absurd to say that it is not the time to look into corruption because of the pandemic. Furthermore, the government has only itself to blame for getting embroiled in the WE Charity scandal.<I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291963">I would like to know if my colleague agrees with me that it is time for the opposition to close ranks and that the proposal to create a special committee to study the issue and let the other committees do their usual work is a good solution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6291980">We find ourselves here today addressing a persistent problem with these Liberals. I was elected in 2018 and my first committee assignment was on the justice committee. The expectation was that, with the agenda set for the spring session prior to an election, it would be a good opportunity for me to learn about how committees operate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291981">What we saw 10 days later was a story in The Globe and Mail that detailed how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Liberal Prime Minister, had interfered in the criminal prosecution of his friends at SNC-Lavalin. This of course led to a real lesson on how Liberals operate at committee and what the Liberals do with their majority at committee. We saw this. They would send in members to shut the committee down. Look, they fired their attorney general. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291982">We heard that because it was 2015 things were going to be done differently. Canada had a female indigenous attorney general. She stood up, spoke truth to power and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> kicked her out of caucus. We had Dr. Jane Philpott as Treasury Board president, who stood up and spoke truth to power. She saw that what was happening was wrong. What happened? He kicked her out of cabinet and kicked her out of caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291983">Accountability is not the strong suit of the government, to say the least, and we saw that. Before I was elected, we saw in “The Trudeau Report” that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not understand ethics laws. That is what we were led to believe. It was the first mistake. The second time was the “Trudeau II Report”, the second wave, if we will, of ethical law breaking by these Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291984">We arrive in a pandemic after my second election, not even two years after I was first elected, and parliamentarians worked together to get results for Canadians in challenging times. We hear it over and over again that these are unprecedented times. It was very interesting to observe that. I have heard from veteran members that it was very unique to see that type of collaboration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291985">One of the first things the government did was try an unprecedented power grab. It wanted the ability to tax and spend without parliamentary oversight until December of 2021. That was the Liberals' goodwill. That was their working together. It was their team Canada approach. It is staggering the arrogance these Liberals demonstrated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291986">During the summer, we learned an organization that had paid half a million dollars to members of the Trudeau family was given a half-billion dollar contract to administer, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, whose family members had benefited from that relationship. This is during the same summer we had the Prime Minister's chief of staff with questionable connections in the awarding of the emergency commercial rent assistance program. We had the awarding of a contract to build ventilators, ventilators that had no regulatory approval, but the manufacturer, the person who owned the company, was in the caucus room with these Liberals last year. It was a former Liberal MP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291987">Parliamentarians started to look at the awarding of this half-billion dollar contract. To be fair, originally it was announced that it was $912 million. However, what happened seemed like a bit of scattershot because, as we learned in the investigation that followed, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was announcing programs that had just been put on his desk and the details had not been completely worked out. That was on April 22, but on April 21, the program had been written. Who wrote it? It was the WE organization that wrote it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6291988">We will hear that it could only be administered by the WE organization. However, it could only be administered by it because it wrote it. The organization wrote a proposal that only it could complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291989">When the proposal went to cabinet, what was included? Ultimately, it did need to be approved by the cabinet. It was accountable and responsible for the decision. Those decision-makers made their decision, complete with a picture book, and the picture book contained pictures of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. That was the compelling argument. It was not based on the organization's merits; it was based on who it knew. This is what we are seeing with the programs that are being awarded. It is the connections between these individuals and people in the halls of power. With the Liberals, it is not what they know, it is who they know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291990">Then questions started getting too intense and documents were ordered. On the eve of the release of these documents, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament. It was a cover-up prorogation. The Prime Minister said, “When Parliament resumes in the fall there will be ample opportunities to continue to ask whatever questions committees or members want to continue to do.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291991">We were led to believe it was not a cover-up. He said that we could ask any questions, that committees could do their work. Now we are back and the Liberals have taken every opportunity to filibuster those committees, and not just the ones asking about the scandals. They are filibustering the health committee, which is asking questions specifically about COVID-related measures. To be fair, these issues and scandals arose out of an abuse of power when we had these contracts being awarded to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291992">Back in August, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that we could ask whatever questions we wanted. We are in October now and what is he saying? He is saying that if we ask questions about corruption in the Prime Minister's Office or around the cabinet table, members will be met with filibusters. If the filibusters do not wear the opposition down, the Liberals will force Canadians into an election. That is their threat, that is their bluff. During the second wave of a pandemic, they will force Canadians into an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291993">We are actually into the third wave, which is the third wave of Liberal corruption. We had that first report from the Ethics Commissioner which found the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> guilty of breaking ethics laws. The second report from the Ethics Commissioner found the Prime Minister guilty of breaking ethics laws. He is now under investigation for a third time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291994">Committees have ordered these documents. The Liberals will stop at nothing and literally force an election over not releasing these documents. That is very different from the open by default, sunshine is the best disinfectant and sunny ways <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> we heard from just a few years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291995">Where is that open and accountable government document? Contrary to the promises we heard in 2015, it looks like the Liberals no longer believe that better is always possible. The official opposition, Canada's Conservatives, in concert with the other opposition parties of conscience will stand against Liberal corruption and will not collude with the government. None of us are calling for an election, and it says so in the motion. If discomfort is the ground the Liberals want to use to force an election, that is on their conscience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6291996">We will vote our conscience. We will stand for what is right, we will stand for an accountable government and the Liberals can tell stories about years past and prime ministers long ago.

              <ParaText id="6292014">Madam Speaker, what a pleasure it is to be back in the House for regular sittings. It is the first time since, I believe, March 12, so I am glad to be back here speaking on behalf of my constituents in central Alberta and the riding of Red Deer—Lacombe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292015">I want to thank my colleague who just spoke for the excellent work he is doing in holding the Liberal government to account. He has a very busy job as the ethics critic for the Liberal government, which means he is the busiest man in Canada. I want to thank him very much for the fine work he is doing. I know my colleagues will join me in showing him some appreciation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292016">My constituents are very frustrated on a number of fronts. They are frustrated with the Liberal government's policy on energy. My riding is much like that of Sarnia, Ontario. There is a large petrochemical installation in my riding. It was one of the last holdouts of good paying jobs in central Alberta, which is now under attack by the Liberal government. Those jobs now seem to be in jeopardy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292017">More important, my constituents are frustrated with the amount of unaccountable spending by the government. Billions of dollars have been rushed out the door. I cannot remember the last time the House sat and passed an actual budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292018">These are unprecedented times. We all know, going back in the history books to 1995 and the previous Liberal government of Jean Chrétien, that when money is being spent in a big rush under the guise of an urgent matter, such as the sponsorship scandal then, the Liberals cannot not help themselves when it came to lining their own pockets. The amount of money back then pales in comparison to the amount of money being spent today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292019">One only has to look at the reason for this motion today to have an anti-corruption committee because of the amount of money that has gone out, with virtually no accountability. First, we needed to shut down the House because of the pandemic. Now the Liberals are keeping Canadians and Parliamentarians in the dark, not because it suits the health care interests of the country but because it suits their design of holding onto power desperately, so desperately, in fact, that they are willing to cause an election that nobody actually wants. They are willing to throw down that gauntlet, force an election on the Canadian public during a pandemic just to cover up the fact that they do not want to talk anymore or have anymore information uncovered about this WE scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292020">Why is this important? It is important on a number of fronts. One is that we need to have trust and confidence in our institutions. The primary institution that Canadians need to have trust in is Parliament. If parliamentarians are not able to do their jobs, if we are not able to get the information we need at committee, if we are not able to have the correct information to make decisions and recommendations, then we are not able to do our jobs. We need that confidence and ability to get that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292021">What have we seen so far? My colleague who just spoke said that we were in the third wave of Liberal corruption. I would suggest that we are in a wave pool. The waves just keep coming. The first one was cash for access, which was a very big deal. If people wanted to have influence with the government, all they had to do was go to a fundraiser. If it was a foreign government, all it had to do was to put a whole bunch of money into a foundation that happened to share the same last name as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and it could get what it wanted, so much so that the government had to change the rules. Because the Prime Minister was unable to follow his own rules, we had to change them so political entities could continue to do their business without the issue of cash for access or the perception of being able to buy one's way into the Liberal government's inner circle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292022">That was one of the first major issues the government had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292023"> Then we had the trip to billionaire island, friends of the family. I remember that very well as the former chair of the ethics committee at the time. It was epic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292024">Four times, under four different counts, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is the very first prime minister in Canadian history to be charged under ethics laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292025">
                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Harper brought it in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292026">
                <B> Mr. Blaine Calkins:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague said that Harper brought it in. Yes he did. He was wise. He knew that the Liberals would someday form government again and they could not help themselves, which is why we know about this. I thank Stephen Harper for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292027">This was the beginning of the erosion of trust that Canadians have in the government. The Prime Minister broke the rules four times, but that alone was not enough. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292028">Then we moved to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which is absolutely disturbing. I remember one of the low points in the last Parliament was the feeling of complete and utter disgust. The former attorney general, now an independent member of Parliament, an aboriginal woman with a good reputation who wanted to do the right thing, resisted at all measures and all counts the pressure she was put under by the public service doing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s bidding, by the Prime Minister himself, and by several in the Prime Minister's cabinet and their senior officials. This suggests that the Prime Minister was going to get his way, one way or another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292029"> I guess that is pretty indicative of how this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> runs things, which is where we find ourselves today. He is going to get his way on this motion, one way or another. How someone does one thing is usually how they do all things, and we have seen this behaviour before. The Prime Minister has thrown down that gauntlet because he was going to get his way in SNC-Lavalin, and he is pretty sure he is going to get his way this time as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292030"> I am curious to see what the NDP will do when it comes time to vote. The New Democrats say that there are three options before the House, but the last time I checked we can vote yea or nay for a motion. Those are the only two options. I suppose they can abstain and run away, but we will see what the NDP does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292031">With the SNC-Lavalin affair, it was the first time in history that we had an eminently qualified woman of aboriginal descent, and she was absolutely treated like rubbish. She was cast out of not only her cabinet portfolio but also her caucus. Her reward was her voters in the last election, who sent a clear message, not only to the Liberal government but also to all parliamentarians, that the way we conduct ourselves and the way we comport ourselves matter. Ethics and integrity matter, which brings us to the present day and the WE scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292032"> We know, because of the bits of information that we have been able to extract so far, that the government's message and narrative on this issue does not match the evidence we have. It does not match it at all. It is no coincidence whatsoever that the prorogation was timed immediately prior to the release of documents. By the way, the parliamentary law clerk was supposed to oversee the redaction according to the committee's request. However, because Parliament was prorogued, the government got to decide what was redacted in those documents. That is not a coincidence. That has cover-up written all over it. It is not the crime, but the cover-up that causes all the issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292033">Instead of talking about the things that we ought to be talking about today, we, as the official opposition, find ourselves doing the work that is necessary to expose this corruption for Canadians, to get to the bottom of it and to send a message to Canadians that their tax dollars are going to be spent on the interests they have. Those dollars will not be spent on the interests of the Liberal Party, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or well-connected Liberal insiders, instead of being used to deal with other economic issues, health issues or first nations issues. There are all kinds of issues across this country. Many of them are manufactured, I would suggest, by the policies of the current government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292034">We should be talking about those issues, but there are 338 of us here in this House. There is not a problem at all with a dozen or so of us taking time out of our otherwise busy days and having one more committee to sit on to look into this corruption. Canadians deserve answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292035"> I am proud of our leader. I am proud of the team I am surrounded with here, and I am proud to stand up for all Canadians across this country to get to the bottom of this. I will be supporting this motion wholeheartedly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292054">The opposition plays a very important role, and within that, opposition day motions play a very important role. This is especially the case during times of crisis. It is an opportunity for the opposition to have an entire day to raise matters that are meaningful, and to put forward ideas that actually matter and that have an impact on the direction of the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292055">We are seized now, as a country, with COVID-19. It is important for us to think about the way forward and to engage in debate on that very important issue. It is the challenge and crisis of our time. Indeed, it is, without question, the biggest crisis of our time, and certainly the most important one we have faced as Canadians since World War II. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292056">Sacrifices have been made by Canadians throughout the country. I think about the first wave in the spring. We all saw our constituents, and we all had those conversations. There were constituents who stayed home, who kept their distance from loved ones, and it has had a tremendous impact. We will tell our children, grandchildren and future generations about it when we get past this crisis, and we will get past it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292057"> The virus did overcome us, but it did not defeat us. The economy has suffered its largest contraction since the 1930s, and unemployment has increased to levels we have not seen in our lifetimes. Those are the facts that we see on paper and the points we see recited in the business press and newspapers, on television and online. However, it has to be said that the challenges that have been endured and the sacrifices that have been made have been those of real, everyday people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292058"> For individuals and businesses, I cannot properly put into words what they have gone through for their country. I talk to those individuals and business owners every day, and they have had enduring questions as we have passed through the first wave and are now in the midst of a second wave. It is important that the government continue to seize itself with these matters and with this large issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292059">However, I am heartened by the fact that at least there is a blueprint, a very important and concrete one, which was established during the first wave, and that is the set of programs that have held the country up, both individuals and businesses. I am thinking about the Canada emergency response benefit, CERB, in particular, which has now transitioned to the Canada recovery benefit, CRB. I am thinking about the Canada emergency business account, CEBA, and the wage subsidy that has helped so many businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292060">We heard my hon. colleague for <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> talk about the CERB today. There were close to nine million Canadians who benefited from that lifeline, and that is a term I do not use lightly, because it was a lifeline for so many Canadians. It ensured they could still put food on the table and take care of their bills and other expenses. Of course, the government had to act, and it did so with measures like the CERB.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292061">I have talked to countless business owners in my community who have benefited from the Canada emergency business account and, of course, a portion of that is forgivable. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292062">CEBA was extremely important and was an idea that came in part from the work done at committees, committees that have an important role. I will discuss the role and potential of committees in a moment. Serving on the Standing Committee on Finance, as I do, is a tremendous honour. In the spring we had an opportunity to raise ideas directly to the then finance minister, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of cabinet on what was needed. CEBA was an idea that came out of that engagement, at least in part. Certainly the bureaucracy played an important role and has advised on this and helped to design programs, and its role cannot be understated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292063">The wage subsidy is a very successful program. I was thrilled to see in throne speech that the government decided to continue it well into 2021. Of course we await more details on that. We could be debating such matters, but unfortunately the opposition is seized with other issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292064">I mentioned the public service's extraordinary work, particularly on the CERB and getting it out to Canadians in record speed. That needs to be underlined, along with all the other work it has done. I would be remiss, and I know all members, regardless of party affiliation, would agree, if I did not mention the work done in constituency offices by our incredible office staff. In my case it is Ryan Gauss, Josh Chadwick, Asiya Barakzai and Zheger Hassan who helped me in ways I will never forget in the spring during the crisis and now in the second wave. I know we all value our staff very much engaging with constituents and picking up those phone calls. There are record number of cases coming through our offices. In fact, in my office we have seen about a 350% increase in email and call volumes. I know other MPs will have similar stories to tell this House. It is something we have all seen. We continue to rely on our staff, who have been truly tremendous in this experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292065">Have mistakes been made during the COVID-19 experience? Has the federal government made mistakes? It has made mistakes. How can one not make mistakes as a government when one is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis and flying the plane and building it at the same time, so to speak? The programs the government has put in place have never been seen before, programs like the CERB and all the other programs I mentioned. As one is moving at record speed, one is certainly going to make a mistake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292066">Is the WE Charity issue one of those mistakes? It is. I put that on the record before at the finance committee; other Liberal members have as well. The government has done well, but can the government do better? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292067">What we see today is an opposition day motion that completely ignores the issues of the day. The Conservatives have presented a motion intended to paralyze the government at this most critical time. They proposed a committee that would serve their partisan interests, not the interests of Canadians. There is nothing wrong with reviewing spending. The government has proposed an idea that would lead to the creation of a committee that would do just that. It would review all COVID-19 spending in a non-partisan way. That is necessary. We do need that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292068">However, what the Conservatives are pointing to is something quite different. They use the word “corruption”. I would caution my colleagues to be careful with the words they use. The word “corruption” implies something quite specific. It implies that members of the government are on the take and that there is some sort of agreement between members of the government and those who have been mentioned, whether it is with the WE Charity organizations and others, where payments are being received or something along those lines. Very nefarious actions are being pointed to that do not exist. Let us be careful with the words we use. I wonder if members would use the word “corruption” out of this chamber. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292069">Of course the government is right to see this as a matter of confidence. We have seen the hypocrisy of the Conservatives when at the finance committee we could have looked at redacted documents and they turned down the idea of having public servants come to testify as to why documents were redacted.

It is not a mistake when Frank Baylis leaves this chamber as a Liberal member of Parliament and gets a multi-million dollar contract for ventilators. It is not a mistake when all this happens.

I do not dismiss that, but let us be very clear. When the member and his colleagues use words like “corruption”, it implies something very nefarious indeed. It implies that there is a formal agreement or informal agreement between organizations and individuals and government members where government members are on the take, as I said, receiving payment in return for political favour. That has not been established, ever. I wonder if the hon. member and his colleagues would go out of this chamber and make that accusation. When they use words like “corruption”, they really have to consider what it is they are doing in this House. There is no substance to that accusation whatsoever. Yes, mistakes have been made.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6292090">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to follow my colleague's thoughtful remarks. I have had a certain amount of experience in this House, as members know. I have had the opportunity to observe opposition tactics over the years, some valid and some egregious. I would put this motion in the latter category.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292091">I would describe this motion as a publicity stunt. What gave it away for me was the original title of the motion, which has since been changed in a kind of Conservative sleight of hand when they realized that maybe they had overstepped themselves a little. When I heard the title, it reminded me of how the Conservatives used to name bills in a previous Parliament. They would give bills sort of Orwellian names, intended to communicate for electoral purposes. I remember when the Conservatives brought in a bill that was really an exercise in voter suppression and called it the “Fair Elections Act.” We know that the Conservatives like to engage in sloganeering, in how they name their bills and motions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292092">This is supposed to be Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. What is implied in the title of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is the notion of constructive contribution and of constructive opposition, worthy of a Diefenbaker or a Stanfield or a Clark or, on our side, a John Turner, who recently passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292093">This motion is profoundly disingenuous, because it really does not seek to scrutinize, broadly, the government policies and expenditures that have been implemented in response to the pandemic. Its intention is really to disrupt for some putative political gain, smack in the middle of the greatest crisis this country has faced since the Second World War. Canadians are not impressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292094">Let us look at some of the basic facts about the WE controversy. My colleague just mentioned in his speech that there was no private financial interest in the agreement between the federal government and WE. There was merely a mutually shared goal of helping young people financially survive an unprecedented pandemic and build their careers through meaningful volunteerism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292095">What the opposition, which claims to be so transparent and noble, fails to tell Canadians is that the WE Charity is not permitted to turn a profit in its dealings with the government or with anyone else, and that is because it is a charity. To preserve its charity tax status, it has to operate as a non-profit organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292096">The Conservatives, and, sadly, the NDP has done the same, have let people believe that this was a $900-million contract for an organization, when that in fact was not the case. The $900 million was to be distributed on the ground amongst other organizations. The WE Charity was to be paid for administrative costs, which amounted to 5% of that amount of $900 million, but saying it was to be 5% of $900 million would not make many headlines. We know that is what the opposition is after here, headlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292097">The Conservatives conveniently leave out the fact that the recommendation to use WE came from the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy had its reasons for recommending a third party and they seemed pretty obvious, namely it had capacity issues during a pandemic, when the energy, time and attention of public servants were highly focused on the task of designing and rolling out a series of unprecedented support measures in an unprecedented period of time, in an unprecedented health, social and economic crisis. Again, not the party of Diefenbaker, Stanfield or Clark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292098">Another reason why the bureaucracy was not equipped to do this particular job is that it simply did not have the organizational and digital infrastructure to mobilize Canadian youth quickly.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292099">We know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> preferred using an existing government program and bureaucracy, the Canada Service Corps. That being said, this was by no means the first time the government had used third parties with robust established national networks to deliver support for Canadians. The United Way is one example. The Red Cross is another example. Food Banks Canada is a third example. Besides, one would think that the Conservatives, for ideological reasons, would welcome using third parties, because their refrain is that governments cannot do everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292100">The government has proposed a constructive alternative to this misguided Conservative motion. We have proposed that the House appoint a special committee with the mandate to conduct hearings to examine and review all aspects of the government's spending in response to the pandemic. The committee would mirror the balance in committees now, which reflects the relative distribution of seats that Canadians voted for a year ago. The Conservative motion would single-handedly change the standard makeup of committees in this Parliament. Rather than have six members out of 12 for the government, it would reduce the government's representation to one-third of the members of the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292101">How did the Conservatives come up with this number? It boggles the mind. Why not two? Why not one? Why not leave government members off the committee altogether?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292102">The committee the government is proposing would conform to current party proportions, because that is how Canadians voted. The committee the government is proposing would have all the powers of standing committees and would free up all the other committees that the Conservatives are currently paralyzing in the midst of a pandemic. The government has also proactively suggested that the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and other ministers and senior officials would appear as witnesses from time to time, as the committee sees fit. The committee would also be given the mandate to take over responsibility for the issue of document redactions related to the July 7 motion currently before the finance committee. The committee would allow public servants the opportunity to explain their decisions, before trying to hold them in contempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292103">A true fiscal Conservative would jump at the opportunity to create such a committee with such a wide-ranging mandate, but the Conservatives just want to let the opportunity go by and indulge in sloganeering, the lazy politician's pastime. Why are the Conservatives choosing this facile and empty road so often travelled by their party these days? It is because they do not have anything else to talk about. It is because the Conservatives do not have a credible climate plan that can serve, at the same time, to build a more resilient and sustainable economy. It is because the Conservatives do not have a child care plan to allow families, women in particular, to enter and stay in the workforce and contribute economically to this country. It is because the Conservatives do not have a plan for ensuring that our seniors are properly taken care of in long-term care facilities. It is because they do not have a housing plan. It is because they do not have a plan for the auto industry to transition to zero-emission vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292104">The Conservatives just came out of yet another leadership contest. One would think they would have some ideas. What does one do as an empty policy shell? One plays a shell game. That is what we have here, unfortunately, but this is not the time for games or sleight of hand. People are suffering, businesses are hanging on and people are getting sick. The official opposition needs to start contributing something meaningful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292120">Concerned with the destruction of small businesses, the loss of jobs and Canada's poor performance at the bottom of the pack, the Conservatives came forward with a non-partisan proposal that would take the WE scandal out of the finance committee and put it in a special stand-alone, investigative committee. Let finance do finance, let health do health and let this special committee examine this file. Let us get back to work for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292121">We expected that this would be a unanimous proposition given that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has claimed to be so concerned about the well-being of Canadians in this pandemic and economic shutdown. Instead, the Prime Minister has said the opposite. He said that if we investigate the WE scandal any further, he will bring down his own government and force an election in the middle of the second wave of a pandemic. Wow. By the way, he says he has nothing to hide. In other words, there is no secret, but Liberals are prepared to cause an election to prevent it from coming out. Nobody believes that. Thou doth protest too much, Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292122">If he had nothing to hide, he would not have shut down Parliament in the first place. If there was nothing to hide, he would not be threatening to bring his government down today. If he did, we can only imagine what his campaign slogan would be: “Give me a majority so that no one can investigate me.” That is effectively what he is asking for. In fact, what is ironic about his election threat is that he admits it has nothing to do with any policy agenda. He does not claim that there is some policy action for Canadians he would like to take but cannot because he is in a minority Parliament. He admits that he is able to do everything from a public policy point of view that he wants to do. It is just that he cannot tolerate the thought that one little committee might ask some inconvenient little questions about the affair that saw him and his family receive over half a million dollars from a group and then saw him intervene to give that same group a half a billion dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292123">All we want to do is ask a few little questions about that. We do not want to stand in the way of the government's policy responses. If they are meritorious, they will pass through the House of Commons. We do not want to stand in the way of a single, solitary parliamentary committee. Let them all do their work. Let us take this WE matter, which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> finds so agonizingly distracting, and put it in a separate place, a safe space, where everyone can ask some direct questions and use the powers of Parliament to get some direct answers.</ParaText>

Here is a great social justice warrior who has gone around telling us how much he is concerned about the downtrodden. He tells us he is a big believer in redistributing wealth from those who have to those who have not. That is funny, because he has no problem taking money from charities, money that little kids donated with the expectation it would go to poor people in developing countries, and putting it into his own millionaire pocket. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292127">His family are millionaires. There was an inheritance from his grandfather, who was a petroleum magnate. He made lots of money in the energy business and passed it down. We have a millionaire <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. One would think if he was such a social justice warrior, he would be giving money to charities and his family would be in a rush to hand that money out to those with less. No, he is the exact opposite of Robin Hood. He steals from the poor to give to the rich, especially to himself. Here again we have an example of that.</ParaText>

Do members think any of them were told the money would be used to pay off the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s millionaire family, or to take the multi-millionaire former finance minister and his family on luxurious vacations? Of course not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292129">This is not just an example of corruption but of gross personal hypocrisy. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would prefer that we all just stop talking about it, and not just prefer.

Will it hereafter set a precedent that whenever a scandal gets too close to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> he can simply put an end to Parliament and call an election, effectively banning opposition members from asking questions about how he used public funds to reimburse those who have paid his family? Is that the precedent we now set? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292130">Are we really going to devolve to a point where a prime minister is a king and he slams his fist, says he has heard enough, wants no more questions, wants all investigations to cease and if they do not he will bring the whole place tumbling down? That is the precedent the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seeks to create, but we will not be deterred. We were elected to hold the government to account, and we will do exactly that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292131">We will get to the bottom of this scandal. We will further propose key measures to ensure that no prime minister is able to enrich himself at the public expense the way the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has, and that accountability is once again the law of the land. </ParaText>

As my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> stated, if the government has nothing to hide, then let us proceed. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has famously said that sunshine is the best disinfectant. Why would the Prime Minister not want to let the sun shine in?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292155">Let me just say that at the top of the list is the WE scandal. It started back in late June when it was discovered that an organization called the WE organization had received a half a billion dollar, sole-source contribution agreement. It was known at that time that there were links between the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his wife, and the Kielburger brothers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292156">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, however, said there was nothing to see. He said he had not benefited from the WE organization. His wife had a podcast, but that was all. It turns out that was not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292157">About two weeks later it was revealed that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s brother, mother and spouse had received more than half a million dollars in fees and expenses from none other than the WE organization. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that he had no choice, that it was the civil service that recommended the WE organization receive this half-a-billion-dollar, sole-source contribution agreement. That turned out not to be true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292158">Indeed, the more we learn, the more questions arise. For a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said there was no political interference and no political direction, we learned that in addition to the Kielburgers just by coincidence enriching the Prime Minister's family, there had been multiple communications between the Kielburgers and the former minister of finance in the way of three emails and a telephone conversation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292159">We learned that there were multiple communications between the Kielburgers and officials in former finance minister Bill Morneau's office. Indeed, Michelle Kovacevic, a senior finance official, noted that the PMO was weighing in and that the Kielburgers and the finance minister were besties. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that there was no political interference and he knew nothing. However, as the evidence mounted, the more and more it became clear that the Prime Minister's words were not worth the paper they were written on. The fact is that there was political direction. We know that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292160"> Then we ask why there would be political direction to an organization that had never administered such a program before, that did not have the capacity to administer such a program before, that was in chaos at the time in terms of firing staff and the chair of its board and being in breach of its banking covenants. For an organization that was seemingly the only organization that could possibly administer this program, it is rather interesting that an organization with that kind of a record, which should have been at the bottom of the list, went to the top of the list. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292161">The simple explanation is that there was a quid pro quo. The WE organization benefited the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family and in return it received sole-sourced contracts with the federal government. There were at least five such sole-sourced contracts prior to the big enchilada of the half-a-billion-dollar contribution agreement. That alarmed Canadians, and rightfully so. It raised a lot of questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292162">I happened to serve on the finance committee with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, who ably led the committee for the official opposition as we sought answers. In the course of those hearings, the government agreed to produce relevant documents. Then what happened? On the very day that 5,000 pages of documents were produced, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament. The day that the Prime Minister prorogued Parliament was none other than the day prior to which all of these speaking fee documents were to be provided to the ethics committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292163">For a government that talks so much about caring for Canadians, about being so preoccupied with addressing the pandemic, the record of the government has been to obstruct, filibuster, shut down Parliament and now even to threaten an election to cover up its own corruption and it is prepared to do so even at the expense of the health, safety and economic vitality of Canadians during this unprecedented crisis. It is an absolute disgrace. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292185">I join the debate today with a certain amount of disappointment that the official opposition is choosing to use today's motion, not to discuss the issues that matter to Canadians during this pandemic but instead to continue a partisan and unnecessary attack on the government. Those members could be using today's debate to promote an issue that would have a real impact on Canadians, but instead they have chosen an unfortunate and confrontational approach that is out of touch with the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292186">Unlike the Conservative Party, our government remains focused on the issues that are affecting Canadians across the country, irrespective of their political leanings, just as we have since the beginning of this pandemic. We hope that in the future we will see more of the collaborative approach from opposition parties to adopting and improving measures that will have a clear benefit for Canadians, similar to what we as a Parliament were able to accomplish early during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292187">Canadians today are facing a second wave of COVID-19 and that leaves people worrying about their jobs, the safety of their families and friends, and even just their day-to-day lives. Responding to those needs should be the focus for us as Parliamentarians to support them in their time of need. To that end, I would like to take my time today to look at some of the measures our government introduced to ensure the safety and continued prosperity of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292188">When the pandemic first came to Canadian shores, our government worked tirelessly to ensure that Canadians trapped abroad were able to return to the country. I wonder if members recall what those early days and weeks were like, when citizens in my riding of Châteauguay—Lacolle, and I know across the country, had been travelling across various parts of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292189"> In our case, a group of school children were in Honduras when the pandemic hit. Lockdowns were happening and countries were closing their borders. We had to work urgently to get those young people back as well as many other travellers. I heard members of other parties say how much they appreciated the work of Global Affairs, the public servants, extra staff and call centres in getting Canadians back safely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292190">We worked with airlines and foreign governments to find ways to get Canadians home from far-flung regions around the world. It was a challenging and difficult process, but we were able to get the job done with the support of commercial airlines and partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292191"> In doing so, we had to ensure the safety of Canadians at home and required that those entering Canada had to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return. In the early days of this pandemic, people were wondering if that was necessary. It absolutely was. Today, it is a matter of course. It is well accepted by Canadians in the interest of public health. This policy remains important to this day as we attempt to flatten the curve of the second wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292192">Along those same lines, we have continued to follow the best guidance of our doctors and scientists to protect Canadians, and I emphasize that fact. This is not a political or partisan point of view. This meant making some difficult choices along with our provincial and territorial partners, choices that would make it difficult for many Canadians to earn a living, making it a struggle to pay for their groceries, rent and everyday needs through no fault of their own. I say these were choices, but in a sense they were the right things to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292193"> Having made the difficult but clearly necessary decisions to protect Canadians, we had to implement quick, agile policy to support those who would be most affected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292194">Knowing full well that the health of Canadians was at stake, our government had to find innovative ways to help all those who were affected. In March, we introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, the CERB. This was unprecedented. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292195">As I said, earlier, Canadians needed to replace the income they had lost through no fault of their own. Through this benefit, Canadians who lost their source of income because of the pandemic were able to receive up to $2,000 per month. I know that people in my riding really appreciated that. It meant that ordinary Canadians were able to maintain their purchasing power and keep the economy running at a basic minimum level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292196">Never before has the government reacted so quickly by implementing this type of program to guarantee that all Canadians received the help that they so desperately needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292197">The CERB was essential for those who had lost their jobs, those who had to self-isolate and those who had to care for someone with COVID-19. Every day, my riding office received calls and emails from people who were affected not only by the loss of their job, but also by having to keep their children at home or by the illness itself. This financial support was critical. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292198">We also recognized that the pandemic was having a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups in our society. We announced several measures to help the most vulnerable Canadians cope with the health and socio-economic effects of the pandemic, measures such as support for people experiencing homelessness and for women and children facing violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292199">Kids Help Phone experienced a dramatic surge in demand, so we increased our support for that organization. We invested millions of dollars in food banks and other organizations to improve access to food for Canadians in need. In Châteauguay, Saint-Rémi and Mercier in my riding, people were very grateful for that. All these investments gave community organizations the support they needed to provide essential services to vulnerable and needy Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292200">Together with the provinces and territories, we also announced up to $3 billion to top up the wages of low-income essential workers. These people kept going to work every morning to make sure their neighbours, neighbourhoods and communities could get everything they needed. They showed up for work every day despite the risks associated with COVID-19, and Canadians were able to count on them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292201">I could speak for another 10 minutes about all the programs we have brought in, but I would just like to mention a few. The Canada emergency wage subsidy was created to allow businesses to retain their employees. The deferral of GST payments essentially amounted to an interest-free short-term loan. We also made close to $25 billion available to banking institutions to provide loans to small businesses in need. Finally, we launched a loan guarantee program for SMEs. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292202">We announced early plans to support Canadian businesses as they scaled up production and retooled their manufacturing to develop made-in-Canada products that would fight against COVID-19. I would like to congratulate all those businesses for the good work they did right from the beginning, including those in my riding of Châteauguay—Lacolle, where farmers, manufacturers and transport companies stepped up the challenge. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292459">We cannot turn our committees into partisan tools to force private citizens to release personal information. Where does this end? We cannot have the Conservatives drowning the government in document requests with arbitrary deadlines designed to be impossible to meet, forcing public servants to drop their work on supporting Canadians during this pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292460">I want to take a few moments to talk about the extraordinary work done by the public service these past few months. I think we can all agree that in these extraordinary times, no Canadian should have to worry about paying their bills, rent or putting food on the table, including those wonderful residents in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292461">Our government is unwavering in our commitment to support Canadians, our health care system and our economy. Allow me to outline and highlight some of the measures our government has taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been our focus, the government's focus, and our sole focus. This is where our efforts and time have gone to helping Canadians from coast to coast to coast. This is what Canadians elected us to do, what they expect us to do, and this is what we will continue to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292462">Our government created the Canada emergency response benefit, CERB, to keep Canadians safe by encouraging them to stay home and help flatten the curve. As businesses closed, we knew we needed to respond quickly to support Canadians, and we did. Since March 15, nearly nine million people have received CERB. This is how families avoid financial crisis while keeping our economy afloat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292463">The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been difficult for Canadians and their families, and frankly, these individuals are our friends, our neighbours and for some of us our family members. Even though employment is on the rise and many Canadians have returned to a full work schedule, others are still facing job insecurity or struggling to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292464">As COVID-19 cases increase across the country, our government's priority is to ensure all Canadians have the resources they need to weather the second wave of the crisis. To continue support for Canadians while promoting economic recovery, we introduced further measures that encourage people to return to work and help those who have work but may still need some support due to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292465">These measures include flexibilities to the EI program that will allow more Canadians to qualify and receive a minimum of $500 per week for at least 26 weeks; an EI premium rate freeze for the next two years for our small businesses, which will benefit employees and employers as it prevents the rise of EI premiums during a period of economic recovery; and the Canada recovery benefit for self-employed workers and workers not eligible for EI. Over 600,000 Canadians to date have applied and are now receiving the Canada recovery benefit. They are not alone and we will not leave them alone; we have their backs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292466">Other measures include the Canada recovery sickness benefit for workers who are unable to work because they are sick or must self-isolate for reasons related to COVID-19, as well as the Canada recovery caregiving benefit for eligible Canadians who have been unable to work because they need to care for a child or family member. Combined, these measures will help to ensure the health and safety of Canadians while protecting the businesses where they work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292467">Let me now turn to support for students. Shortly after the CERB was created, we followed up with the Canada emergency student benefit. With many young Canadians facing unprecedented challenges in the wake of COVID-19, whether having recently graduated and looking forward to starting their career, or still in school and counting on summer employment to pay tuition, our government had their backs. The CESB supported students and recent graduates who are not covered by the CERB in order to ensure they could continue their studies and pay their tuition. I am proud to report that over 700,000 students were assisted by the CESB.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292468">From May to August 2020, the CESB provided a payment to eligible students of $1,250 for each four-week period, or $2,000 for each four-week period if one had dependants or a disability. We also helped students gain valuable work experience and serve their communities by making temporary changes to expand the Canada summer jobs program, which employs 70,000 young people each year in quality jobs in our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292469">We did not stop there. The government also introduced further measures to benefit students. This includes a six-month, interest-free payment moratorium on Canada student loans or Canada apprentice loans for all students, including graduate students.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292470">Canada student grants were doubled for all eligible full-time students to up to $6,000 and up to $3,600 for part-time students. In addition, the Government of Canada increased existing distinctions-based support for first nations, Inuit and Métis nation students pursuing post-secondary education. We extended expiring federal grant research scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292471">These supports have helped young Canadians get through this crisis and have helped play a central role in ensuring Canada emerges from these challenges stronger than ever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292472">Just as our young people are key to our future, we owe our elders, our seniors a great debt for everything they have done in our past. They have sacrificed much to build this great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292473"> Many Canadian seniors have faced significant health, economic and social challenges due to COVID-19, isolation being among the most that I hear of from my seniors. They built our country and they have needed our help. Our government took action to provide seniors with greater financial security and gave them the help they needed during this crisis: issuing a one-time tax repayment of $300 for those who are eligible for the old age security pension; a further $200 for those who are eligible for the GIS or the allowance for the survivor, worth $500 for seniors who receive both; supporting new community-based projects to improve the quality of life of seniors and reduce social isolation through the new horizons for seniors program; ensuring the most vulnerable seniors continue to receive the benefits they depend on by temporarily extending GIS allowance payments if their 2019 income information has not been assessed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292474">As we go through this unprecedented challenge, our government will continue to be there for seniors, and not only seniors but Canadians living with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292475"> I encourage all Canadians to file their taxes so they can receive the benefits and credits they deserve, including our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292476">There is support for Canadian seniors living with disabilities. We know this pandemic has deeply affected the lives and health of all Canadians and disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292477"> From the beginning, we have taken a disability inclusive approach to our emergency response to ensure Canadians with disabilities get the support they need. We announced a one-time payment of $600 for persons with disabilities to address these expenses. This payment will go to valid disability tax credit certificate holders, which includes parents with children or dependants with disabilities, seniors, veterans and many other Canadians who we know have costs associated with severe and prolonged disabilities. We are confident that this measure along with the other investments will greatly benefit Canadians with disabilities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292478"> We all benefit when everyone can participate equally in our economy and our society. We as a government have long stated that diversity is our strength, but I would argue that inclusivity is even more important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292479">This is just a snapshot of the hard work our government has done to support Canadians in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292499">The day is developing in an interesting fashion. For anyone watching, this is a day that is specifically allotted to the official opposition to choose whatever matter it wishes to bring before the House for debate. The idea that this is somehow hijacking Parliament or that we somehow are not doing our jobs by bringing forward a matter that we consider to be of importance to Canadians is outrageous. We are doing our jobs. This is a day that the government provides to the opposition to bring forward a matter that it believes should be addressed by the House. Therefore, we will take no lessons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292500">Repeatedly today the Liberals have been saying to the Conservative opposition that we should do whatever they are doing. They want to know why we are not working with them to come up with programs that benefit Liberal-friendly firms. They want us to step aside and let them railroad all over Parliament. When the Liberals shut down Parliament and prorogued it for weeks, they wondered why we did not agree with them. Why do we not all become Liberal members of Parliament and just embrace the government's agenda? That is what the Liberals are asking us to do today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292501">We have been working with the government on COVID-related matters for months. In fact, I was part of a group that sat down with leadership from all parties to discuss how we would go forward and govern ourselves during this pandemic. In good faith, we allowed for Parliament to take a break because we did not know what the pandemic would bring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292502">What was the response from the Liberal government? After that act of good faith and after working together to put the safety and security of Canadians first, what did the Liberals do? They tried to jam a bill down our throats that would have removed the power of Parliament until December of 2021. That was the Liberal response to working together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292503">Forgive me if I do not just stop doing my job as a member of the opposition and give the government a blank cheque to do whatever it wants. We have seen what it will do with it. The Liberals are asking us to just work on COVID-related matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292504">The WE Charity scandal was borne out of an attempt to rush money out the door and do it in a way that benefited a Liberal-friendly charity. Charities all over the country are suffering right now. Their donations are down. They do not know how they will make ends meet. The people who they serve are not getting the same level of support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292505"> However, not all those charities have paid half a million dollars to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. Therefore, they did not get a half-a-billion program designed by themselves from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292506"> The fact that the program has now been abandoned in its entirety tells us that it was a complete and total failure. If the government actually believed in the program, it would have stuck it out. It would have stuck with WE and continued down the road of a completely flawed program that did not serve the people it was intended to serve, but rather served people who had served the Liberal Party through the Prime Minister's family. It also produced some fantastic propaganda videos for the Prime Minister in the past and pumped his tires wherever it could. It was a Liberal-friendly charity that got Canadian taxpayer dollars. That is what we are talking about today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292507">The motion we are talking about today calls for the creation of a parliamentary committee so the Liberals will finally stop blocking the work of the finance committee, the ethics committee and now the health committee. Right now they are blocking any attempts to get work done at those committees. They have been talking non-stop for days to avoid votes coming to the floor at those committees.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292508">Why would they do that unless they were afraid of what those motions call for? The motions call for the production of papers for documents that had previously been agreed to be released, before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shut down Parliament just days before those documents were set to be released. It was supposed to be for a historic reset. The Liberals needed time to get the brains around the table, as was said in QP today, to come up with a new plan that would launch Canada into the new reality that we would face in COVID-19, post-COVID-19 or a “living with COVID-19” world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292509">What did they do instead? It was just a rehash of things they have not delivered on over the last five years. There was no grand vision that was launched. There was no reset. It was just a rehash, a warming over of previous Liberal promises that have not been delivered on. Liberals prorogued Parliament to prevent those documents from coming forward. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said it was just temporary and that, when Parliament came back, if parliamentarians wished, they could ask for the information again. This was not shutting down investigations; it was just a little delay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292510">Of course now they have switched tactics and will not allow votes to come forward at those committees, which has prompted us to come forward with this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292511">What is the response to a motion to create a committee? The response is that before they let that happen there will be an election. That is what we are hearing today from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He bragged about it today. The House leader was similarly threatening to plunge Canadians into an election over the creation of a committee and the release of documents that have been previously ordered released. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292512">These are the reasons the government is giving for threatening an election. What the Liberals are really doing is threatening members of Parliament. They are threatening members of Parliament by saying, if we vote for the creation of this committee, if we vote to have these documents released as was previously voted on and agreed to by all parties, it is go time. It is time for the election. It is time to get signs out, go door knocking in a pandemic. It is “we will stop at nothing”. The ultimate nuclear weapon in a minority Parliament is to threaten an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292513">The Liberals have done it to protect the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from whatever is in those documents. I do not know what is in the documents. Canadians would like to know. The motion calls for the documents to be examined in camera. The Liberals are threatening an election over letting 12 parliamentarians see documents and not be able to talk about them in public. That is enough to threaten an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292514">Conservatives will not be intimidated. We will do our jobs. We will talk about the pandemic and, quite frankly, I resent the use of health workers, small businesses and the people in my community to suggest that if we bring forward this motion to demand accountability, somehow we are not supporting them during COVID. What a ridiculous assertion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292515">To use health care workers, who did not have PPE at the beginning of this crisis because of the inaction of government, to say that the Liberals are standing up for health care workers and if we vote for this motion, we are not, that is outrageous. To say about small business owners, who are hanging on by their fingernails because the government failed to secure the borders early enough because the government gave bad advice from the start, that somehow if we vote for the creation of a committee we are voting against those small business owners, that is outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292516">My constituents will not allow the COVID-19 pandemic to be used as a fig leaf to cover up Liberal corruption. I am tired of hearing it. I have heard it all day long. If we do not talk about that every moment of every day, stay tuned. We have another day that is allotted to us to talk about the issues we wish to raise later this week, and not by obstructing the work of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292517">If the government does not cause its own defeat over this motion, we will talk about the failures of the government on COVID-19. We will talk about where we have worked together, but what we will not be is intimidated into silence, into sweeping Liberal corruption under the rug simply because that is what the government wants to threaten us with, saying there will be an election if we vote in favour of a committee. What a ridiculous thing. We are here to work for Canadians, but we are not here to turn a blind eye to Liberal corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292518">We will be voting in favour of this motion and so should all members of Parliament who actually want to get to the bottom of the WE scandal and the Liberal corruption in it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292539">Mr. Speaker, 338 of us sit in the House of Commons as elected representatives. We have been given the voice of the Canadian public. We occupy a place of sacred trust. It is not our right to be in Parliament but rather our privilege, and it should be stewarded as such. It is a tremendous honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292540">Sadly, this summer we learned that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave $912 million to the WE Charity Foundation. He gave the money to it in the name of running a youth grant program. This seemed innocent at first, but upon closer examination it was found that the Prime Minister and a number of his ministers enjoy close ties with the co-founders of this charity. In fact, almost half a million dollars have been funnelled through WE to the family members of the Prime Minister and his former finance minister. This is a classic case of using one's position of power to reward friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292541">What this ultimately comes down to is trust. Canadians want to know that the government is stewarding the trust that has been placed in it. Canadians rightly want to know that they are not being misled, deceived and taken advantage of by those who they have elected to represent them in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292542">What the Conservatives are proposing today is that a special committee be set up to look into this matter. The proposed committee would examine the misuse of taxpayers' dollars during what the Liberals, by their own admission, are calling the worst crisis since World War II. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292543">One of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s campaign promises in the last election had to do with strengthening Parliament and public institutions. In fact, on the Liberal Party website it says, “Parliament works best when its members are free to do what they have been elected to do: be the voice for their communities, and hold the government to account.” It goes on to promise that Liberals will take steps to strengthen Parliament. We are giving the Prime Minister and his members an opportunity to do just that. We agree with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that trust does need to be restored in this Parliament, and one of the best ways to do that is to bear in mind his own advice: to let the sunshine in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292544">Before entering public life, in one of the leadership roles I carried, I had the responsibility of managing bank accounts and signing cheques. When I assumed the role, only one signing authority was necessary. I insisted on having the process changed so that two signing authorities were required. Why did I do this? I wanted it to be done this way for two reasons: one, it held me accountable by ensuring that a second person would see the amount that I was spending and what I was spending it on; and two, it protected me from being perceived or accused of wrongdoing. I had nothing to fear because I had nothing to hide, but I had a lot to gain from the extra element of accountability and the protection that was granted by adding a second signing authority. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292545">Similarly, if the Liberals have nothing to hide, then the establishment of this special committee should be welcomed. In fact, it should be wanted. It would simply affirm what the government claims to be true: It would increase public trust and would make us, the opposition, look ridiculously silly if the Liberals are in fact telling the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292546">The Liberals would have the opportunity to watch their numbers grow. The polls would rise and they could call an election. Things would be great for them. Unfortunately, if things are false or not as they claim, they do in fact have a lot to fear. This would explain why they are trying to shut this down. They keep fighting us. Could it be because they are guilty? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292547">The Liberals continue to utter the mantra “nothing to see here”, yet they have spent dozens of hours filibustering at committee meetings. They have put their thumbs over the camera to pretend there is a technical glitch. They have gone as far as to shut down Parliament during most of August and September, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued it, and now they are threatening to force an election should we continue to push for a special committee. This scandal must be really bad if they are willing to go through this much work and effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292548">In August, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shut down Parliament to block investigations into his scandal, he claimed, “When Parliament resumes in the fall there will be ample opportunities to continue to ask whatever questions committees or members want to continue to do,” yet we see the exact opposite happening. This is a massive cover-up, but it makes sense. This is not the first time the Prime Minister has been caught in a breach. It is not the first time that he has taken advantage of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292549">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is facing his third investigation by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner in less than five years. This is unprecedented. No other prime minister in Canada's history has ever been convicted of an ethics violation, let alone being found guilty of two and under investigation for a third time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292550">With regard to the WE scandal, there are a few things we know for sure. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s mother, wife and brother have received almost half a million dollars from WE. We know the charity was to receive $912 million from the Prime Minister to administer a youth grant program. We know that $43.5 million of that was to be kept at the WE Charity Foundation for administrative costs. The rest was supposed to be issued directly to young people. We know the Canada student service grant was announced on April 22. We know someone from the Prime Minister's Office spoke with WE about its proposal on May 5, which also happened to be the same day that WE was allowed to start charging expenses for administering the program. We also know that cabinet did not actually approve this proposal until almost 20 days later, on May 22.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292551">Something smells fishy. It doesn't quite add up. Why was the WE Charity assured it could start charging expenses and spend taxpayer money for a program that was not even approved yet? That is odd, right? Could it be because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was doing a favour for his friends, who had done numerous favours for him in the past? This is one of the reasons we need this committee. We have important questions. Canadians have important questions, and they need them answered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292552">Winston Churchill famously said, “The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is.” The Liberals can fight as hard as they want to keep the truth hidden. They can shut down Parliament, try to change the channel and filibuster for dozens of hours. However, here is the thing. The truth always comes out. It always reveals itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292553">The Liberals continue to accuse us of being out of step with Canadians because we are calling for this study and are not solely focused on the pandemic. This is an incredibly egocentric thing to say. Suggesting that Canadians are only concerned with COVID-19 and could not possibly simultaneously care about something like ethics, morality or the strength of democracy is extremely naive, paternalistic and condescending of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292554">Let us put aside the Liberals' folly for just a moment. Let us consider the fact that the WE scandal is currently being investigated by three different committees, including the finance committee. Setting up a special committee dedicated solely to the WE investigation would allow other committees to return to their important work, with a strong focus on helping Canadians get through the pandemic and look after their livelihoods. In other words, if the Liberals truly want Parliament to focus its time and energy on responding to COVID, they should vote yes for the formation of this special committee. That is unless the Liberal virus known as corruption is more dangerous than the COVID virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292555">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said it well when he said that the best disinfectant is to let the sun shine in. Why is he so afraid to let the special committee come together? Why is he afraid of having his decisions examined? Why is he afraid of being held accountable? What is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> covering up? The answers to these questions lie within the formation of this committee. It would allow the other committees to get back to their important work and serve Canadians well while simultaneously getting to the bottom of the WE scandal.</ParaText>

Borrowing what had been done in history, we wanted to bring all the parties to the table, with members to represent them, and have a conversation about the best response to COVID-19. We felt this would serve Canadians well. It would put more minds together, and we could work as a collective for the well-being of the Canadian public. At the end of the day, of course it would be up to the government to make final decisions, to put forward policy and to implement spending, but at least it would give us an understanding of one another's perspective and would enrich the decision-making process.

Our main focus has been, and continues to be, how to best help and protect Canadians through these very difficult times. The last few months, I think everyone will agree, demonstrated the extraordinary work Parliament can achieve for Canadians when parliamentarians work together. We are now well into October, and our government is working very hard to ensure that we are doing everything we can to protect Canadians from the COVID-19 virus. This has been our priority since the start of the pandemic and it continues to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292571">Unfortunately, under their new leader, the Conservatives want to play politics and carry on their inquisition, and before I argue why the motion presented by the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> is irresponsible, I want to take a moment to look back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292572">When it became obvious back in March that COVID-19 was a serious crisis, our government rapidly refocused efforts on providing help as quickly as possible. We took an all-hands-on-deck approach, because we knew that the health and safety of Canadians were at stake. I am sure colleagues on all sides of the House will remember how many emails, phone calls and other communications we received from folks in our communities who needed help, and fast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292573">When workers told us they had suddenly lost their jobs, we provided the CERB within a matter of weeks, which provided direct income to over 277,000 Manitobans, alone. When seniors said they were having challenges making ends meet due to additional costs, we listened to them. Over 14,000 seniors in my community alone received a tax-free top-up to their OAS and GIS payments. When parents said they were struggling to provide for their children, we immediately provided a top-up to the Canada child benefit. I know that for over 18,000 families in my community who received this benefit, the additional top-up in May meant that they could make it through to the next month. When small businesses came to us and said they were hard hit by the pandemic, we acted very quickly. Over 18,000 businesses in Manitoba received access to the $40,000 CEBA loan, as well as the wage subsidy and other business programs. This financial support meant that local business owners could keep the lights on, pay their employees and support their own families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292574">Each one of us who fills a seat in the House of Commons came here to fight for the best interests of our communities. I know that the folks in my community are worried about their jobs, their health and the safety of their loved ones. They want to know what parliamentarians are going to do to make sure we get them to the other side of this pandemic. I am not convinced the Conservatives are focused on the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292575">We recognized the financial impact of doing what needs to be done, all while knowing that doing less would cost more. That is why we agree that a special House of Commons committee, dedicated to studying COVID-19-related investments, should be established. Adopting the reasonable motion the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> put forward on Sunday night would achieve this. This special committee would help to ensure that other standing committees could do their work and focus on the issue that truly matters: COVID-19. Unfortunately, the motion for a special committee, put forward by the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, would not accomplish this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292576">Rather than focusing on how the government and Parliament can work together to best support Canadians, the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> put forward a blatantly partisan proposal. Its main objective is to paralyze the government at a time when the entire Government of Canada is focused on keeping Canadians safe and healthy. If this is the Conservatives' priority, one has to wonder if they are taking the pandemic seriously at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292577">Their caucus has used uncertified tests. There are stories in the media about them not practising physical distancing in the antechamber. There is even a picture from an event with the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> wherein people are unmasked, and just days ago he claimed he was immune to COVID-19. We know that is not a fact. It is very disappointing to see this lack of seriousness on their part, and Canadians are watching. Canadians are watching because we are in the midst of a second wave. They want their politicians to be leaders now, but we agree that does not mean that Parliament cannot perform its usual practices of holding the government to account, and that is why we have proposed a reasonable, responsible alternative to the Conservatives' ridiculous motion. There is a reasonable path forward.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292578">The committee would mirror the balance in committees now. The committee would have all the powers of a standing committee, as provided in the Standing Orders. This would free up all the other standing committees that the Conservatives are jamming up with their inquisition. We have also proactively suggested in the motion that the <Affiliation DbId="263832" Type="96">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and other ministers and senior officials would appear as witnesses from time to time as the committee sees fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292579">The committee would also be given the mandate to take over responsibility for the issue of document redactions related to the July 7, 2020, motion currently before the Standing Committee on Finance. I think most reasonable people would agree that this is a reasonable way forward and that is what Canadians want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292580"> We cannot turn our committees into partisan tools to force private citizens to release personal financial information. Where does this end? My opposition colleagues can continue down this road if they so wish, but I doubt that Canadians will follow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292581">In conclusion, I think all members would agree that there is so much more work to do. Our government has procured tens of millions of pieces of PPE, secured millions of rapid tests for deployment to the provinces, and is working to revamp and overhaul our aged EI system. This pandemic exposed holes in our social safety net, shining light on the need for reforms and the need to rethink how we protect the most vulnerable in this country. That is what our government is focused on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292582">We are focused on the path ahead and guiding Canadians through the second wave of COVID-19. We are focused on the challenging economic recovery before us. We have already seen a rebound; however, we know there are tens of thousands of businesses and many Canadians who still need our help. That is where the priorities of Parliament need to lie. Our focus is forward on the problems facing our country and finding the solutions to fix them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292583">We do not want an election. Canadians do not want an election. We have important legislation before the House, as hon. members will know. I invite my opposition colleagues to get serious and consider the proposal that our <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> has put forward.</ParaText>

He is saying that the government does not want an election, yet the Liberals are claiming that this is a matter of confidence.

              <ParaText id="6292595">This morning I got up and took some time to visit with young entrepreneurs because this is Small Business Week. Their business is called Kyan Cuisine. Our government's support was very important to them. Their revenue plunged because of COVID-19. Their products were on supermarket shelves, but, unfortunately, they had to adjust. They got help from a program that got money out the door to community development corporations across the country, including the Prescott-Russell Community Development Corporation, the PRCDC. I want to congratulate John Candie and the PRCDC team in my riding, who are doing excellent work to support our businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292596">They were able to do it with the $20,000 they received, which enabled them to regroup, go digital, create a website and reach new customers.

              <ParaText id="6292597">About a month and a half ago, the Conservatives had their leadership race and I thought we were going to hear a different tone from them. I thought we were really going to hear a different tone from what the member for <Affiliation DbId="252794" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> demonstrated in the House of Commons. However, I can see that the Conservative Party of Canada is dead. I heard the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> mention he wants to take Canada back. He took the Conservative Party way back, way back to the nineties of the Reform Party and the Canadian Alliance. That is what that particular party on the other side of the House has become.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292598">Am I the only one who views this Tory supply motion as wanting to set up a McCarthy House committee that has absolutely no value and no purpose to serve Canadians? It is trying to perhaps go after the Liberals the way the former McCarthy committee tried to go after American values in the U.S. a few decades ago. That particular committee would be a witch hunt. It is a drive-by smear, and that has to stop. Do not take my word for it. Take the words of Kory Teneycke, a former Conservative, who continues to hate Liberals, who wrote a pretty good article about the drive-by smears that the leader of the official opposition and all members of the official opposition are doing on people who said yes to serving Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292599">When will it be enough for the official opposition? When will it be enough? They will not take the word of the Ethics Commissioner who, by the way, denied the request from the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252796" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation>. He said that their drive-by smear of the chief of staff and her husband had absolutely no merit. What was put in this motion is the same damn thing. They put the same request in the motion, so tell me how this is not a drive-by smear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292600">Listening to the official opposition, it is as if there was zero accountability that happened during the summer. Just before we were prorogued, 5,000 documents were provided to the committee. They went through it. They even created a website. Then the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appeared before that committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292601">Again, do not compare the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to the Almighty; compare him to the alternative. All of the members who were sitting in the House almost seven years ago, when they were asked to pass a motion in the House to have the former prime minister appear before a committee, what did those members who are now the official opposition do? They voted against it. That is a true lack of transparency. This side of the House and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> believe in transparency and appeared before the committee, something that the Conservatives would have never done in the 10 years in this place they were on this side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292602">We have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who appeared before the committee. We have multiple ministers who appeared before the committee. We have ADMs, deputy ministers and a bunch of witnesses who appeared before the finance committee, and still to this day it is not enough. Now what we are seeing is that they are proposing this witch hunt committee proposal, which makes absolutely no sense and goes after innocent people who have zero business in this affair. I will not let this happen and I will be voting against this particular motion because it makes absolutely no sense.</ParaText>

It was the same thing for the leader of the official opposition. He said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needed to resign and there was corruption happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292604">Corruption is a Criminal Code offence, and if they have evidence, they can submit it to the RCMP. They will do their job. In fact, both parties called the RCMP and to this day we are still waiting for charges. We are still waiting to have people go to jail. For the only member of Parliament who went to jail, it was not a parliamentary committee that decided whether that particular member of Parliament should go to jail; it was the cops. It was a Conservative member of Parliament, and they should be ashamed of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292605">I have advice for the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and the advice does not necessarily come from me. It comes from health officials across Canada. It is a simple piece of advice to just wear a mask when he cannot physically distance himself. Time and again, and my colleague the parliamentary secretary mentioned a few examples, the Leader of the Opposition was taking pictures without physically distancing. Again, this weekend, we saw him with Mr. Kenney, who is no longer in the Ottawa bubble. Therefore, he should wear a mask. He is the leader of the official opposition and he is supposed to lead by example. If he wants to be Prime Minister one day, he should lead by example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292606">When folks are talking to me in the riding, they want to know that we are there for them in times of need, especially in times of COVID-19.

              <ParaText id="6292607">In terms of funding for businesses, the Canada emergency wage subsidy helps our entrepreneurs who need to reinvent themselves and go online. I am thinking about the restaurant industry needing help to get through this second wave we are sadly in the middle of. I was hoping to debate a motion today that would offer a way to help our businesses across Canada. I think it is important to support them in order to help them get through this crisis and ensure their ongoing presence in our urban centres. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292608">I will close by simply saying that I am extremely disappointed in the opposition members. I am not surprised. I have been here for five years, but I have been watching them for more than five years. What was true in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2015 and 2019 is still true today. Opposition members are behaving in the same irresponsible way they always did and are bringing partisanship to a whole new level. It is pure partisanship like in the days of the Reform Party and the Canadian Alliance in the 1990s. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292648">Mr. Speaker, the Liberals intend to continue to debate these facts but some things are not debatable, including when this scandal first broke and the WE organization said that it never pays speakers.

What we found out was that the Liberal finance minister had received a luxury vacation from this charity in the amount of over $40,000. I do not even know what kind of holiday he was having for $40,000. Good for him, I suppose, but what kind of charity offers a multi-millionaire a $40,000 vacation? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292650">My community has been involved in school fundraisers for the WE Charity. If the moms and dads who were collecting bottles in my community to support the WE Charity found out they were financing a $40,000-vacation for a multi-millionaire Liberal finance minister, they would be shocked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292651">Then we found out that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family had received around half a million dollars in fees for speaking engagements, whatever it was, as the story continues to change as to why they were paid. All we know is they were paid. Of course, at the same time, WE was producing ads that were glowing of the Prime Minister and ads to promote the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292652">Now the Liberals say we cannot have a special committee to review all of this. We cannot do that. Why can we not do that? They say it is because it will paralyze Parliament. Let us just remember that no minister, not the Prime Minister, no bureaucrats, sit on committees. It is all just regular members of Parliament, none of whom have ministerial responsibilities, so we can probably have 12 members sit on a committee without paralyzing Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292653">What is the Liberals' solution, their counter to this proposal? Instead of setting up a special committee that gets documents, they would like to set up a special committee that does not get the documents. That is their solution, and that would ensure we did not paralyze Parliament if we had a different special committee that did not get the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292654">We are going to continue to demand those documents. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been found guilty of ethics violations time after time. I suspect very shortly it is going to be another time; the first prime minister in Canadian history.

What is in these documents that he would go to the extraordinary length of proroguing Parliament, embarrassing all of his members who are being sent to committees to filibuster day after day and hour after hour, or now threatening an election to ensure those documents never get released?

              <ParaText id="6292674">Mr. Speaker, when I was a junior air force officer, my first posting was as the procurement officer for 19 Wing Comox on Vancouver Island. I was responsible for everything that was bought or leased on the base. In other words, anyone working on the base who needed something had to get it through me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292675">My decisions were not arbitrary or made on a whim. Before I was assigned the job, I spent many months in training as a military logistician, studying over 20 volumes of the Canadian Forces publication 181, supply manuals, defence procurement policies, the Financial Administration Act and many other related documents. There were processes and procedures for everything. Just to obtain approval to procure a commercial coffee maker required 10 signatures on a material authorization change request, or MACR for short. Those 10 people included the base commander, a squadron commander, a flight commander and me, just to name a few. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292676">This bureaucracy was tiresome to be sure, but it was essential to upholding that no one, not even the base commander, could use military funds, and by extension public money, to, for example, pay for an outrageously expensive coffee machine purchased sole-source, which happened to include a million-dollar administration fee for someone's husband. There was no room for misconduct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292677">As officers, we endured the necessary piles of paperwork to ensure that tax dollars were spent wisely and to preserve the honesty and integrity of the organization and everyone in it. If these were the high standards to which a junior air force procurement officer is held, should they be any less for the highest office in the land?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292678"> Let us talk about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his pattern of behaviour of breaking the rules, giving money to his friends, using Liberal members to cover it up and firing anyone who dares to stand in his way. Let us talk about the Prime Minister's pattern of corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292679">His first transgression was the gift of an all-expenses-paid Christmas vacation for him, his family and his friends to an island in the Bahamas. The rules require that members of Parliament disclose any gift over $200. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty of breaking the Conflict of Interest Act. He apologized. Seamus O'Regan, a minister of the Crown who joined the Prime Minister on this trip, never disclosed the vacation as a gift.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292680">Then came the SNC-Lavalin scandal. SNC was charged with fraud and corruption, and was seeking a way to get out of facing the full consequences of breaking the law. It looked to our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to use his powers to circumvent the law and tip the scales in SNC's favour. A <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> stood in his way and upheld the rule of law. For her efforts, she was fired as justice minister and thrown out of the Liberal Party. There was no place in the Liberal Party for honourable actions like that. The key adviser and friend to the Prime Minister, Gerry Butts, resigned.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292685">Mr. Speaker, the head of our non-partisan, hard-working public service chose that moment to retire. Liberal members on the House of Commons committees attempting to investigate shut down all attempts to get to the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292686"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty of a second ethics violation, but this time he showed no remorse. He had no intention of acting differently. He refused to apologize and instead doubled down, trying to convince us that it was okay to break the law for the right reasons, like helping his corporate friends escape the long arm of the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292687">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has again used the powers of his office for personal gain. The Prime Minister attempted to award the WE Charity a $912-million government contract, $912 million in taxpayer dollars, in a closed, directed, no competition selection process. During a pandemic that has millions of Canadians struggling to pay their bills, our Prime Minister attempted to give hard-earned tax dollars to an organization to do what exactly?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292688"> For starters, an administration fee of $43.5 million would be pocketed directly by the WE Charity, a charity that just happened to have paid the Prime Minister's family and the family members of other members of his cabinet significant sums of money. Once again, the House of Commons committees investigating were stonewalled and then ultimately shut down when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament, leaving Canadians with no government at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292689">For a third time, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is being investigated for ethics violations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292690">However, this is not just a story about the Prime Minister. It is unfortunately much worse than that. The Prime Minister's actions send a message to others who would seek to break the rules, cheat and take advantage of their positions of power for personal gain. It gives them permission to put their personal agendas before the best interests of the country. It becomes a culture of acceptance of corruption, because, after all, if the Prime Minister can do it, why should they not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292691">For example, the former finance minister, Bill Morneau, was investigated for conflict of interest violations for a corporation that held a French villa that he forgot to disclose. He was also investigated for failing to put the shares of his company in a blind trust and then introduced pension legislation changes that would benefit corporations like his. Morneau also forgot to disclose or pay back the all-expenses paid $40,000-plus vacation that WE Charity gave him and his family. Yes, that is the same WE Charity. Coincidentally, two of his daughters have worked extensively with WE. Morneau was about to be investigated for ethics violations but instead resigned as a minister and a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292692">The list goes on. What about when the <Affiliation DbId="263834" Type="96">President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs</Affiliation> broke the law when, as fisheries minister, he approved an Arctic surf clam licence to the company his wife works for; or when the $84 million contract to administer the Canadian emergency commercial rent assistance program was out-sourced to the company that PMO chief of staff Katie Telford's husband works for? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292693">What about the former Liberal Raj Grewal who allegedly received $6 million that he did not disclose to the Ethics Commissioner? Documents also claim that he solicited funds by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means in connection with his duties of office as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292694">These are just the cases that have been uncovered. Like the tip of the iceberg, if this is the pattern of corruption that we can see, we can barely imagine the magnitude of what has not yet come to light or what the government wants to ensure never comes to light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292695"> House of Commons committees are Parliament's version of the military's MACR, from a junior officer's time all those years ago. Committees are our checks and balances. The purpose of committees is to investigate and to problem solve. Committees hold governments to account, identify where they have failed. Committees are the work that members of Parliament get paid to do to deliver fair, equal and improved services for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292696">The Liberal members are shutting down committees. They are working to keep the full extent of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s transgressions hidden. They are determined to keep Canadians in the dark. Liberal MPs are complicit in the cover-up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292697">When the government acts this way, breaking the law, circumventing rules and processes, shutting down committees and refusing to release documents and completely redacting the ones they do, it sends one clear message. It is not acting in the bests interests of Canada and it is not putting the needs of Canadians ahead of itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292698">I was not raised to turn a blind eye to such behaviour and my constituents in Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill have not sent me here to turn a blind eye. The citizens of the country did not elect the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to use the powers of office for his own gain and Canadians did not elect members of Parliament to help him cover it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292699"> During this pandemic billions of dollars are being spent. We need a special House of Commons committee to investigate how they are being spent. We need the facts. We need to uncover the truth. We need to know how bad it is and we need to fix it fast.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292728">I think that the government is scraping the bottom of the barrel today. The Liberals told us that it is too bad if we, the men and women of the opposition, do our job because they will not allow that to happen. They will trigger an election and say that it is our fault. I think that is rather shocking. Investigating is the opposition's job, and we are going to do it. We did our job all summer and we will continue to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292729">According to the Liberals, we are going to paralyze Parliament if we form a special committee to study WE Charity. The opposite is true. We are proposing this solution to avoid paralyzing Parliament. My colleagues across the way may not have noticed, but Parliament was paralyzed all summer. All summer, four of the House's standing committees had quite a lot on their plate. They had to drop all their other work to investigate WE Charity. There was the Standing Committee on Finance, the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, and the Standing Committee on Official Languages. Four committees were working on nothing but the WE scandal to try to get more clarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292730">We started up again in September. The Prime Minister had prorogued the House in August, and we started working again. To us, it made no sense. These committees have work to do. Nearly $343 billion has been spent on COVID-19 since the spring. The Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates are going to have to look at that at some point. We felt there needed to be an efficient, logical approach. We are not paralyzing the work of the House. We are creating a separate special committee. That way, the other committees will be able to continue doing their work. That is what we are proposing. We are not proposing to paralyze the House. We want it to work better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292731">Their other argument is that we are in a pandemic. Since everyone is sick and losing their job, it makes no sense to study the WE scandal. That is like saying we have to let them rifle through the pockets of sick people lying in hospital beds and take their wallets without telling them, and they will take care of those wallets. Enough already. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292732">Quebeckers who are sick and losing their jobs still pay income tax. The money this government is spending is their money. These people may be entitled to a doctor, but they are also entitled to MPs who take care of business and make sure that this money is managed properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292733">That is our job. It is not only our right, but our duty, to investigate WE Charity. It would be irresponsible to let these scandals go on without taking action. We will do our job. We must be all the more vigilant now that people are so vulnerable. Many people have COVID-19 or have family members with COVID-19. People have lost their jobs or businesses. Bars and restaurants are closing down. People do not know where to turn. People are sick and need money. Most of all, they need MPs to do their job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292734">The government will not weasel out of the WE Charity scandal. God only knows what a fix we would be in had we not taken action, but the government will not get away with this. What is the government trying to avoid? Is it trying to avoid a thorough analysis and examination of WE Charity, or is it trying to prevent the opposition from taking a close look at everything else? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292735">The $343 billion that has been spent is not peanuts. By refusing to strike the special committee, is the government trying to force us to examine WE Charity in the four standing committees, to prevent us from looking into these matters? Make no mistake, we are going to study this, but by forcing us to spend committee time studying WE Charity, is the government trying to distract us from something else, like what happened with the husband of the Prime Minister's chief of staff, or what happened with the purchase of ventilators? The Liberal motion mentions a few scandals, but that list is nowhere near exhaustive. There are many more. Is that what they are trying to avoid?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292736">If we had not done our work and looked into the WE Charity scandal this summer, the folks at that organization would still have millions of dollars in their pockets, either paid out or reimbursed. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292737">I think it was roughly $30 million. They had a $43-million contract to manage about $900 million in student grants. The $43 million would now be in the pockets of WE Charity. God knows whose pockets the $900 million would be in, because God knows how it would have been managed. The $40,000 that finance minister Morneau repaid to WE Charity the morning that he testified would still be in the pockets of the Morneau family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292738">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> still would not be aware that he was in a conflict of interest. He would still believe that the ethics rules apply to everyone except him. The work we did this summer made the Prime Minister realize this. I was watching him today during question period, and I think that he gets a little more embarrassed every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292739">As I said at the start, the government is scraping the bottom of the barrel. All it can say is that it is too bad, but that if we keep hounding it, if we keep tabs on what it does, if we keep making sure it does not reach into everyone's pockets and hand out the money as it sees fit, it will call an election and then say that it is our fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292740">Our Prime Minister is starting to look a little worn out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292741"> Not so long ago, my leader wondered if the Prime Minister still had the focus to run the government. I do not think he did then, and today, I am sad to say that I do not think this government is run by a Prime Minister who is prepared to lead properly. The scandals keep piling up. It is never-ending. First there was the Aga Khan, then SNC-Lavalin, and now the WE scandal, not to mention the husband of the Prime Minister's chief of staff. Gerald Butts, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, was forced to resign. Everyone is being forced out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292742">I must reiterate that the Prime Minister prorogued Parliament in August. When he was being held accountable and being forced to hand over the information and documents we requested, he decided to drown us in boxes of documents. He sent us 5,000 redacted documents, which is a whole other story, and prorogued Parliament the same day. A few days before that, the then minister of finance resigned. This all happened at the same time, practically the same week. A finance minister being forced to resign is a big deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292743">The government prorogued Parliament and sent over 5,000 pages of redacted documents. I looked at those documents. They were as clear as mud. They were not dated or signed. Any old thing was put down any old way. It is a lot of work to try to understand them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292744">I saw that a few times in my career as a lawyer. Judges imposed penalties for that sort of thing. When one side was required to produce documents, it had to be done properly. They could not just produce any old thing, any old way, in an attempt to overwhelm the other side. That is what happened this summer. As I was saying, the government is scraping the bottom of the barrel today. It is threatening us. As though prorogation were not bad enough, now the government is saying that it will force an election and say that it is our fault. That is irresponsible. We will not let the government get away with that. We will do our job. We will stand up. Regardless of what the Liberals decide to do, we will vote in favour of a special committee to study the WE Charity scandal and any other scandal related to the management of the COVID-19 crisis.</ParaText>

There is no doubt about that, but the position of the Ethics Commissioner is relatively new. It is a positive thing.

              <ParaText id="6292752"> The Mathias Colomb first nation learned from media reports that tents had been produced for it, but they were not what the first nation had specifically requested from the department. Once the matter was made public, we learned that a well-connected Liberal was linked to the company in question. He has since stepped down, fortunately, but the money has already been spent and we are still waiting for answers.

              <ParaText id="6292755">What happened with these indigenous communities is indeed scandalous. I have a lot of sympathy for people in these terrible situations. We will have to deal with this. Back during the 2015 campaign, the Prime Minister said that he would review the Indian Act because it was wrong. Here we are in 2020 and nothing has been done. The Prime Minister continues to claim that the provinces should manage things differently and that such-and-such aspect is worrisome, he sheds a few tears, he presents some apology, and so on and so forth. However, he has yet to touch the Indian Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292756">My colleague is right to raise this issue. Government relations with indigenous peoples are in need of review, which is why we must study the WE Charity scandal in a separate, special committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292757">Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are saying that, right now, it is important to address COVID-19-related issues, and that that is what Canadians and Quebeckers are calling for. They are also saying that, in the interest of time, we need to give priority to managing the crisis rather than to creating a committee. It is so important for them to dedicate all of their time to COVID-19 that, strangely enough, they are telling us that they would rather spend more time on an election than in committee. That seems rather ridiculous to me. They are giving us a choice. They are asking us to choose between the committee and an election. Obviously, the Liberals would rather force an election than create a committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292758">It is either one of two things: either the government is going to seek a confidence vote or it is such a bad poker player that its bluff is not believable. In the end, all the government really wants is an election. That is what we understand since, for the past three weeks, the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> has not stopped talking about an election. Even when we talk to him about machine guns, he responds by talking about an election. The government wants to force an election, but it does not want to take the blame for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292759">We may have to consider a third option that I feel was not covered in the debate. Essentially, maybe the motion is really bad and we should vote against it.

              <ParaText id="6292793">The government seems to think that the committee would be calling all of these witnesses five days a week from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. It is reasonable to expect that there will be time limits placed on witness appearances in committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292799">The motion then talks about the documents that must be produced. It talks about an unredacted version of the 5,000 pages that were already submitted. It says that that information will be considered in camera, which seems like a perfectly acceptable compromise to me. For us to do our job as parliamentarians, we need a complete picture of the situation. When a quarter of the information is redacted, we miss out on context and information. We found some interesting things in the 5,000 pages we received, even though they were redacted. I am sure the parts we cannot see would have interesting things in them too. As MPs, it is our job to ask questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292803">The motion demands a copy of all records at Speakers' Spotlight, including WE Charity events held over the summer. Actually, it is fine if we do not get the records, because we already know about the speaking appearances of members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. He knows about them too. The important thing is that, even though he knew, he did not recuse himself. We could have decided to go ahead with the committee minus that part, and everyone would have been happy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292808">The motion calls on the government to provide all memoranda, emails, and documents relating to prorogation. There is a Standing Order stating that if a government prorogues Parliament, it must provide reasons for its decision. This point would be difficult to oppose, since it is asking for something that is already required pursuant to the Standing Orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292809">Lastly, the motion calls on the government to provide a complete accounting of all communications between the government and any organizations affiliated with WE Charity, which seems completely logical and reasonable to me, in the context of studying a scandal that we have been dealing with for several months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292810">I do not see anything in the motion that would warrant someone putting their neck out, saying that they will not vote in favour and urging others to vote against the motion because it is so terrible that it needs to be a matter of confidence. There must be something else there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292811">Simply put, the government is telling us that it has so much do to take care of the pandemic that it does not have time to be accountable. The government does not want to be told to do two things at once. It does not want to be told to manage a crisis and be accountable at the same time. According to the government, that would be impossible because it is so focused on managing the pandemic that it cannot answer questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292812">If we take that argument to its logical extreme, the government is basically saying that a crisis is the perfect time for it to throw all the ethics rules out the window, because it cannot do two things at once, namely be accountable and manage the crisis. That is rather worrisome. In the best-case scenario, the government has something to hide and does not want us to find out what. In the worst-case scenario, the government is completely incompetent because it is incapable of doing two things at once.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292816">In closing, I would like to remind the House that ethics is the art of doing the right thing even when no one is watching. This seems to be a problem for the government. It needs to have someone looking over its shoulder to make sure it does the right thing at the right time. That is our role as parliamentarians. We will not stop saying that when there is nothing to hide, nothing is hidden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292815">I get the impression that the further we get into this debate, the less it will be about creating a committee that will undermine confidence in the government. I suspect it is what this committee will discover that will undermine confidence in the government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292819">First, does she acknowledge that, according to House rules on normal committee membership, six of the 13 members must be Liberal? According to the Conservatives' proposal, six of the 15 members would be Liberal MPs. Maybe further down the line, there would be three Liberal members. Would she be okay with not having a Bloc Québécois member on the committee? This proposal does not follow the normal committee rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292820">Second, the committee chair is usually a Liberal MP. This proposal stipulates that neither the chair nor the first or second vice-chair shall be Liberals. The party with the greatest number of seats in the House would be entitled only to the third vice-chair position. Again, playing by the Conservatives' rules, there could be committees that exclude a party represented in the House. What is the hon. member's position on these changes to committee membership? </ParaText>

We were never even offered that opportunity. From my understanding, the Conservatives were not offered any opportunity to negotiate on anything the Liberals could not quite swallow. They are trying to bury this. They say that when people want to drown their dogs, they claim the dogs have rabies. All of a sudden, the Liberals find something, because I talked briefly about the content. They found something that will not go over too well. They have never, ever tried to improve this to make it an acceptable motion. This shows that there was never any intention to create such a committee, period.</ParaText>

Some were not able to reach the CRA this weekend because of scheduled maintenance. The Liberals do not seem to have planned ahead to take care of these people, and I can only imagine how worried my constituents are to hear the Liberals threatening an election only a year after the last election and in the middle of a pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292835">I am happy to speak in this debate today. I am happy to speak period, because we do not know when the Liberal government is going to prorogue Parliament, suspend Parliament or call an election to stop parliamentarians from having a voice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292836">I am saddened, however, to be debating this specific motion, a motion to create a committee to examine the ongoing corruption of the Liberal government. Canada is in its second wave of COVID it seems, but we appear to be in our sixth or seventh wave of Liberal corruption. Let us review some of the items at hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292837">The company of the husband of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff was awarded a huge contract to administer the failed rent subsidy program. Let that sink in: $84 million was given to a company for which the husband of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff was a senior executive. The Liberals will say that Katie Telford recused herself from the discussions, but anyone who has worked in the private sector, or even within government, knows that this is a false claim. She can recuse herself on paper, but the reality is that people working for her, people working in the government and people working below her will know she is in power, and their jobs and livelihoods depend on her. They are not going to step in the way. They are going to be influenced by her position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292838">Furthermore, her husband repeatedly lobbied the office of former finance minister Morneau to make tax changes to the wage subsidy program, changes that would have benefited his company and a few other companies. He was not a registered lobbyist, but he used the power of being married to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff, who is basically the most powerful, unelected person in this country. Her husband used that power to lobby the finance minister's office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292839">Staff of the finance minister's office said they were very uncomfortable when dealing with him because they knew he was Telford's husband. This goes back to my comment that she recused herself. People in a position of power like this cannot just wash their hands by simply saying they recuse themselves, as very clearly shown by comments made by the former finance minister's staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292840">We asked in the House, because we heard rumours, whether the husband of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff personally lobbied the PMO. Did we get an answer? Of course not. It was a simple yes-or-no question. The very fact that the Liberals would not answer it leads us to conclude that he was involved and did do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292841">Another issue at hand is ventilators. Former Liberal MP Frank Baylis received a contract for about a quarter of a billion dollars to build ventilators that, by the way, are not approved by any jurisdiction in Canada. Ventilators that normally cost $1,000 to $5,000 now somehow cost up to $24,000 each when being made by a Liberal. Again, they were not approved by any jurisdiction in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292842">No doubt the Liberals would stand up and tell us not to worry, that this has since been approved. I find it remarkable that they can grant a contract worth a quarter of a billion dollars to buy unapproved ventilators, but at the same time have been repeatedly refusing to approve rapid testing kits for Canada. There is a special deal for a Liberal, but for rapid testing kits to get employees working and to protect seniors, no, let us not jump the gun; we cannot approve those. Perhaps if Frank Baylis's company would make rapid testing kits, we could get them into Canadians' hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292843">It does not stop there with him. When he was on the industry committee, his company bid on a contract for a $400,000 grant. His company received that contract about a month and a half after the last election. The Liberals will say not to worry; he was not a member of Parliament at the time. However, when the contract was made available or posted for tender, Frank Baylis's company bid on the grant while he was on the industry committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6292844">Guess who had posted the grant and was deciding the grant. It was Industry Canada. We had a Liberal MP on the industry committee bidding on business being decided on by Industry Canada. This is the same Liberal MP who would have sat on that committee and voted yea or nay on the estimates for that department and whether it received funding. It is also the exact same Liberal MP who berated government employees about not making enough federal money available for research grants, the same grant his company eventually got, further lining the pockets of Liberals, the $400,000 for Frank Baylis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292845">There are other items.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292846"> There is the famous WE scandal; $900 million given to friends of the Liberal Party, sole-sourced of course. We all know WE was in financial trouble. Who comes in like the cavalry? It is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals with $900 million of taxpayer money. This is the same WE that paid for that very cringeworthy election-style video for the Prime Minister a few years back; the same WE that paid the Prime Minister's mother tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees and expenses; the same WE that paid the Prime Minister's brother tens of thousands of dollars to appear; the same WE that paid well over $100,000 to the Prime Minister's wife. Over a half a million of fees was paid out to the Prime Minister's family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292847"> It is the same WE that gave a free vacation worth $40,000, violating ethics rules, for the former finance minister. Of course, Bill Morneau said that he forgot, that he did not see the invoice. Maybe it was sitting at his French villa and he got around to it later. It is the same WE that employed the finance minister's daughter, keeping in mind that the former finance minister and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> were at the cabinet table when this money was approved. It is the same WE that gave non-stop promotional appearances to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292848"> Since then, we also now have the Liberals spending over 20 hours in various committees. blocking the release of various documents regarding the WE scandal. What it is about the Prime Minister and his government that leads to such non-stop corruption? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292849">We had the Vice-Admiral Norman affair, where the former Treasury Board president, Scott Brison, interfered with a contract on behalf of the Irving family in order to scuttle a deal between National Defence and the Davie shipyard. It was not enough for Brison and the Liberals just to interfere with that contract; they went out and destroyed Vice-Admiral Norman's life. Imagine giving 38 years of his life to the defence of his country, just to have the Liberal government destroy his life merely for granting a contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292850">We had the clam scam, where the <Affiliation DbId="253405" Type="4">President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada</Affiliation> directly interfered to give a lucrative clam deal to a paper company owned by a family member. Just to spread the corruption around, the company was also partly owned by a former Liberal MP and the brother of the current MP for <Affiliation DbId="252496" Type="2">Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292851">We had the famous billionaire island visit, where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> received a quarter-million dollar gift, basically from a lobbyist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292852">We had Liberal Raj Grewal using his role on the finance committee to lobby for rules to change investigations into legal gambling activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292853">We had Lav scam, where the government interfered in a judicial process to grant special favours to a company being investigated for corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292854">It saddens me that we need a committee such as this to investigate corruption, but it is necessary for Canadians to have confidence in the government, confidence in the political process and confidence that elected officials will do what is best for Canadians, not just for well-placed Liberal hacks.</ParaText>

Are the Conservatives going to go to those individuals who are Liberals and received CERB, because maybe they had a sign on their lawn? Maybe a business received the wage subsidy because it needed the support, and it might have been identified as Liberal. Whether for Conservatives, New Democrats or Greens, as a government, we were there for all Canadians in every way, and in a tangible way. No, it has not been perfect, but the Conservatives' pure focus is one of disruption of this chamber, and one of causing much frustration in dealing with one issue and one issue alone: ethics. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292864">Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague. I think the overreach the Conservatives are making with their motion is identifying that they are going after corruption and then naming people who have not been found guilty of anything. I know Frank Baylis. He is a well-connected Liberal. Whether or not this deal was right or wrong is something that belongs at committee, because we certainly need to get an answer. However, the idea that this was an act of corruption, and naming Frank Baylis in a parliamentary motion, I find very concerning as we do not have the evidence. It is the same with Rob Silver. I am very concerned about the calls he made. Personally, I think it stinks to high heaven, but the Ethics Commissioner said there was nothing wrong. For Parliament to say that these were acts of corruption, before we have done the investigation, to me is a serious mistake.</ParaText>

Today, however, I cannot say that I am happy to speak. These are strange times we are living through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292869">This is the first time, in the history of the Parliament of Canada, in 150 years, that a government, regardless of stripe, has turned a general-interest motion into a confidence vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292870">This motion is simply about creating a committee. It is not a confidence vote on a budget. All we want is a committee. The government is turning this situation into a confidence vote, knowing full well that this is a very bad time to trigger an election. There is a pandemic that we need to manage. We are here, debating in Parliament, but we cannot forget about the virus or forget that we are in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis.</ParaText>

That is the very serious problem facing our Liberal friends. They know full well that we are right, that the opposition parties—and I thank my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois for working with us on this issue—are not doing this just for fun or to waste time. We are not here to have fun.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292877">There is one thing that bothers me. I am hearing the comments of people who live outside the Ottawa bubble, Canadians, Quebeckers, people who write to us and who watch at home. These people do not understand how this works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292878">To explain this to them in simple terms, what we are doing now is akin to a police investigation. We are gathering documents, asking questions, calling witnesses and questioning them. We did this in various committees, such as the finance, ethics and health committees. These committees are like separate police forces that are each conducting their own investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292879">What we are asking for is the creation of a temporary anti-corruption unit, to compare it to another existing organization that we are familiar with. The work of this unit would be to conduct this investigation because we are dealing with facts, facts that all of my colleagues have been talking about since the beginning of the day and that are set out in the motion, and they pertain to the WE Charity scandal, the relationship between the Prime Minister's family and the Kielburgers and what happened with Frank Baylis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292880">We have evidence, but we do not have enough information to take this any further. Obviously that is why the government is threatening to force an election. It does not want us to get to the bottom of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292881">We are essentially telling the Canadians watching us, listening and trying to understand, that we are simply detectives trying to do our jobs. However, right now we understand the frustration that investigators feel when they encounter obstacles in their investigation or when they reach the end of the investigation only to find that no charges can be laid. All we want is the truth. We have enough clear elements here to justify what we are saying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292882">Earlier I heard the government leader tell Radio-Canada that we just want to shut down government operations. That is completely untrue. On the contrary, we want to free up the other committees so that they can continue their work, since there are votes to review and work to be done. This is work that we want to do, and that everyone wants to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292883">We tend to forget that we are in the midst of a pandemic. There are not many of us here in the House, because we cannot all be here. There are empty benches around me, but there are 338 MPs. There are plenty of people available to deal with committees, and creating a new committee with 12 or 15 members would not pose a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292884">Some members are getting bored. They have been at home for six months now, waiting for this to pass. We could give them some work on this committee and no one would complain because that is why we are here. The questions the new committee will ask are the same ones the other three committees have already asked. We are proposing to put everything under a single umbrella, which is more efficient and faster and will help us get to the bottom of this, get our answers and close the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292885">However, the government is well aware that it is in trouble for the umpteenth time. It has been in trouble for five years now, and it knows that. One day Canadians are going to hear this, they are going to see us and realize that the Conservatives and the Bloc were right, that those guys are really crooked and this has to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292886">The thing is, there is a pandemic and we all agree that we do not want a general election. If not for the pandemic, I would want to hit the campaign trail to put an end to this. However, we are reasonable, although that does not mean we do not want the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292887">We want to get to the bottom of things for Canadians' sake. Canadians are watching us, and we do not want them to think we are a bunch of clowns they are footing the bill for in Ottawa. That is not what they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292888">People know that billions of dollars are at stake and have gone out the door and that there is patronage involved and so on. It is a lot of money. People pay their taxes every year, they send in their tax returns, and they know it will cost them a bundle. These people hope the money will be distributed intelligently, efficiently and for the right reasons, not to help out friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292889">The Liberals have been doing this for a century. Every time the Liberals are in power, there is always a story involving their pals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292890">Even though I was not here at the time, I watched it unfold, like every other Canadian. We see this, and it makes us think of the sponsorship scandal and everything else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292891">There is a pattern with the Liberals: when they do something like this, they act like it is normal and not so bad. If a Conservative, Bloc or NDP MP had done the same thing, a storm would descend on them and would not stop until they were totally annihilated. When the Liberals do these things, it is not so bad. The <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> says that we have been talking about ethics for five years and that it is time to put ethics aside because it is not important. The Liberals basically do not care about ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292892">On our side of the House, ethics are important, especially when it comes to managing public funds. We currently have a serious problem when it comes to the management of public funds, contracts and money handed out to friends. We simply have to get to the bottom of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292893">This motion was not presented to force a confidence vote, but rather to organize Parliament's work, to efficiently create a committee that will finish off the investigation started by three or four other committees and produce a report. If, in the end, the report states that the Liberals did a good job, so much the better for them. If, however, the report states that the matter was botched and that the criticism is deserved, they will have to pay the price. That is all. We are just doing our job.</ParaText>

I think an apology is in order today. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292904">The purpose of the motion is to pick up where we left off. The debate on WE Charity is urgent and necessary, but the Liberal government wanted to put an end to it. We need to resume debate on this matter, and we owe it to the Quebeckers who were outraged about how this played out. We also owe it to all of the parliamentarians who need to get back to work. The Liberal government decided to suspend operations on August 18, in the hopes that this matter would be forgotten and to remind everyone that Canada is in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <ParaText id="6292916">Does the opposition realize that we are in the second wave of this COVID pandemic? Does it understand what is happening? More than 9,000 Canadians have lost their lives to this terrible virus. For the families and friends of these thousands of people, the impacts of this pandemic will stay with them forever. For those who have lost loved ones, 2020 will be remembered as an especially painful year, and we mourn their loss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292917">There is nothing in the motion put forward by the official opposition that we are debating, because they are forcing us to debate it today, that acknowledges this harsh reality. There is nothing. Conservatives are not talking about what Canadians are facing. It is pure politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292918">It will be one year tomorrow, actually, since Canadians made their decision in an election about what they wanted in Ottawa. They elected a minority Parliament. They wanted MPs to collaborate and work together. They grew tired of political games and wanted MPs from all parties to work together on things that matter, the things that are important to Canadians. This became even more important when the COVID-19 pandemic hit earlier this year. Beyond the tragic impact on the health of Canadians, the economic consequences of the pandemic have been devastating for Canadians. Millions have lost their jobs.</ParaText>

We were able to help millions of Canadians who lost their jobs, who were quarantined or who were taking care of someone with COVID-19. Our actions also helped working parents who had to stay home without pay to care for their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292926">Now that the workers who lost their jobs are transitioning to employment insurance, the government has implemented other measures to help all Canadians, to help those who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292927">For people who need a helping hand, we created the Canada recovery benefit and the Canada recovery sickness benefit. Each of these was created because we found a way to work together. A minority government needs the support of at least one opposition party, and we have always managed to get it. At times, we have even gotten everyone's support. The last time we held a vote, all parties voted in favour of the government's proposed measures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292928">Let us not forget that, with the support of the House, we created a wage subsidy program to help businesses keep their employees on the payroll despite reduced demand for their products and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292929">Also, and I am sure this will interest our opposition colleagues, we created the Canada emergency business account to provide interest-free loans to help businesses pay the rent and cover other major costs since the pandemic started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292930">Those are just a few examples of the measures the government has introduced to help Canadians get through these very trying pandemic times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292931">I am going to say this because I want to be very clear: We were able to do all that because we worked with the opposition parties. As a minority government, we needed the support of one party or another, or several parties, and managed to get it for the well-being, health and safety of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292932">The repercussions, whether economic, environmental or social, continue to evolve. The repercussions of this pandemic are far from over. All of this presents a huge challenge for the government, as well as for the opposition parties, which have a duty, under a social pact they entered into with their constituents, to work responsibly in the House. They have the same duty as the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292933">What we are discussing here today is extremely important and serious. So much needs to be done. We have learned a lot about what works to protect the health and safety of Canadians and what we can do to help them get through this pandemic together. That is why the throne speech, which was eagerly read by all members of the House, outlined a number of measures to help Canadians as part of a very ambitious plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292934">I would like to list a few of the priorities set out in the Speech from the Throne, especially those that address the pandemic. I am certain that the government's efforts, especially those made as a result of the throne speech, are of interest to my colleague. For example, the government will help the provinces increase testing capacity, continue to quickly ship PPE across the country, provide these tools to all provinces, work with the provinces and continue our direct financial support for businesses that need this help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292935">Men and women established these businesses. I have the greatest respect for these builders who are going through very tough times. We are there for them and the Speech from the Throne clearly sets out what we want to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292936">We could have been debating all that and the number of things directly related to the pandemic and the government's ability to meet Canadians' needs during this pandemic. No, today we are debating an ultra-partisan motion, courtesy of our Conservative friends, a motion deemed to be irresponsible by many. That is definitely what the government thinks of it, and it is not alone.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6292937">Today's motion by the Conservatives would establish a special committee with the clear purpose, and only one purpose, of paralyzing the government. That is it. That is the only purpose, and they know that. The Conservatives are having fun and laughing about how they are going to jam up the government and how they are going to paralyze the government. That is what the Conservatives are trying to do in the middle of a pandemic. That is exactly what they are trying to do in the middle of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292938">It is not a serious attempt to do serious work. It is a political inquisition. That is all it is. That is it. That is all. That is what it is. We will have none of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292939">The motive is obvious. The Conservatives are trying to create scandals where there are none. They are trying to smear the reputations of good people. It has nothing to do with asking responsible questions about government policy in the middle of a pandemic. There are all those questions they could ask about the efforts of the government and how we could help Canadians. No, the Conservatives are too busy with partisan politics and trying to create this committee. They are very busy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292940">Earlier this week I made a reasonable proposal to the other parliamentary leaders to try to break the impasse we are in. We propose creating a committee to review all COVID-19-related spending. That would allow hon. members to put politics aside and work seriously for all Canadians. Why not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292941">It is a responsible and reasonable proposal. It is serious work. In that committee, hon. members from all parties would scrutinize the COVID-19-related programs, as any serious committee would do. Some hon. members prefer to use committees to give themselves outrageous powers that exceed all the limits of power granted to committees to lead their inquisition, which they have been salivating over from day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292942">A committee like the one we are proposing would allow the opposition to share their comments and suggestions on the programs we have put in place. We have had some hits and misses. We can debate and discuss those. This would allow the government to make changes to existing programs. We can always improve what we are doing and the opposition can contribute to improving the programs that help all Canadians. We are totally open to discussing this in that committee. We are open to listening to their suggestions, as we have been doing from the start and will continue to do.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6292943">The work of the special committee that the government is proposing would clearly demonstrate to Canadians that the government and opposition parties are working together in a constructive and effective way. I think it is a fair proposition. I think we can work together in that committee, but I have a feeling that they will not support it because it is not partisan enough. It is too responsible. I think Canadians would like to see members of Parliament working together in a committee to see how we can improve things. Personally, I think our proposal is the best path forward for this Parliament: not for the government, not for the opposition but for Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292944">I said today that if the Conservatives' proposals pass, it will raise serious questions about whether the House continues to have confidence in the government. This is extremely serious. The words that I chose were not written lightly in the letter I sent to my colleagues. It was important for everyone from all parties to understand that there could be significant political consequences if their ultra-partisan, irresponsible motion passed. It is a serious moment for the House, and this morning I had the opportunity to be even more clear. The government considers this motion to be a matter of confidence. It is a confidence vote. The truth is simple. Members of Parliament cannot establish a new committee with sweeping powers to investigate government corruption and at the same time claim they still have confidence in the government. It is one or the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292945">We all know that, and I hope we can find a solution to all work together for the benefit of all Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6292957">Madam Speaker, on October 6, I asked this government if it would ban the destructive practice of gas fracking in Canada. In his response to my question, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> stated that the government will exceed its 2030 emissions targets. It is important to point out that the current 2030 targets are woefully inadequate. Exceeding a target that is too low is not a win; it is a failure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292958">The minister also stated that the government has introduced regulations to reduce methane emissions. I appreciate the acknowledgement that the federal government has a role in regulating the extractive practices of the energy industry. This is especially true when those practices poison aquifers and airsheds and release climate-destroying pollutants into the atmosphere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292959">Fracking is a process for extracting methane that cannot be controlled. Reducing methane emissions at the wellhead does not make fracking a safe and acceptable practice. Fracking leaks toxic chemicals into aquifers and groundwater, releases pollutants into airsheds, releases methane into the atmosphere and increases seismic activity and earthquakes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292960">Methane is not a transition fuel. It is a climate change accelerator. When methane is leaked into the atmosphere, for the first 20 years, it is 80 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. The practice of fracking poses a direct and immediate threat to our future and the future of our children and grandchildren. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292961">Using chemical fingerprints, researchers have linked the significant spike in methane emissions to the boom in shale and oil and gas fracking. This spike is linked to the accelerated pace of climate change. An estimated 30 million abandoned oil and gas wells around the world are leaking methane. Methane leaks represent as much a threat to climate change as burning coal to generate electricity. The provinces are not talking about new coal plants. Why are they so fired up about gas fracking?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292962">Many jurisdictions that are serious about climate change are banning fracking and the installation of natural gas in new neighbourhoods and buildings. They know that methane is a climate killer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292963">After climate change, water and air pollution represent the biggest threat to human health from fracking. Fracking uses huge amounts of water and creates massive amounts of toxic waste water. People who live near fracking operations have had their wells poisoned, leading to increased disease in humans and animals. Fracking releases poisonous hydrocarbons into airsheds, representing another serious health threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292964"> Fracking has been shown to increase earthquakes. In northwest B.C., fracking in the vicinity of dams on the Peace River is putting the integrity of those dams at risk. The increased seismic activity could lead to the catastrophic failure of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam, the Peace Canyon dam, and it threatens the integrity of the Site C dam, which is under construction on geologically unstable ground. Ironically, the Site C dam is being built to provide cheap, subsidized power to the fracking industry and the LNG industry, which, if continued, could lead to the failure of that dam or a cascading failure of the dams upstream.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292965">Ideally, we should have legislation that regulates against illogical decisions, such as building a dam in a geologically unstable area to support an industry that causes earthquakes, but we cannot regulate for common sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292966">Any government that is serious about arresting climate change and protecting the health of its citizens would ban fracking. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292968">We recognize that methane is a potent greenhouse gas. We also know that taking action on methane emissions is one of the lowest-cost actions to reduce greenhouse gases. With this in mind, and the understanding that regulation of shale gas production is mainly a provincial and territorial responsibility, we have worked together with provinces and industry to finalize national methane regulations. These regulations came into force on January 1, 2020, and require resource developers to eliminate temporary venting during well completions after hydraulic fracturing operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292969">On Canada's emissions, we are making important progress. In December, the Government of Canada announced a commitment to exceed Canada's 2030 emissions reduction targets and chart the path toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada's most recent national report on climate change progress to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the fourth biennial report, demonstrates that the government has made excellent progress in implementing Canada's national climate plan, the pan-Canadian framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292970">For example, this report predicts that in 2030 Canada's GHG emissions will be 227 million tonnes below what was projected in 2015. This is a historic level of emissions reductions, and our energy sector is a significant contributor to our national economy. In light of this and the challenging economic circumstances facing the sector and the regional economies dependent on it, the Government of Canada is providing funding to sustain workers in the energy sector, while cleaning up the environment. This includes up to $1 billion to the Government of Alberta to support the province's work to clean up inactive oil and gas wells across the province, up to $400 million to the Government of Saskatchewan to support work to clean up orphan and inactive wells across the province, up to $120 million to the Government of British Columbia to support work to clean up orphan and inactive oil and gas wells across the province, and $200 million to Alberta to ensure that the Orphan Wells Association is well-funded to support its work to clean up orphan oil and gas sites across Alberta. The OWA will fully repay this amount.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6292971">Fighting climate change does not mean that we need to immediately shut down Canada's energy sectors. Rather, it means that we need to develop Canada's natural resources in a sustainable and responsible way and protect workers with key green investments.</ParaText>

We have already released too much of it into the atmosphere and we must act now to stop these emissions, not just lower them.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6292976">Madam Speaker, I address the House today as a follow up to a question I asked two weeks ago with respect to the dithering of the government, while Canada's oil and gas industry, our nation's pride, continued to face headwinds largely as a result the global pandemic, but also realistically as a result of the government's bias toward the industry and its workers who had largely provided for this nations' prosperity for the past several decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292980"> On March 25 of this year, at the beginning of a pandemic whose effects were multiplied by an ill-timed global oil price war between large state-owned enterprises half a world away, the then minister of finance and the Liberal government proclaimed that support for the industry would be provided not in days or weeks, but in hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292981">Clearly, that proclamation was over-promising and under-delivering. Nearly seven months later, the oil and gas industry continues to face the onslaught of temporary drastic reductions in demand for its resource amidst the world's supply that is robust for the near future. Were the situation to be a new structural scenario for the world energy industry, it is certain that state-owned enterprises would know and would cease further development of their assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292982">Let me provide clarity. Despite some European producers, this is not the case at all. The Middle East sees robust demand for its oil resource for the foreseeable future, going out 30 to 40 years. The world needs energy and it will still need the energy intensity provided by hydrocarbons for which the world has, as of yet, no close competitor, particularly with respect to transportation fuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292983">I know parties will quarrel that this is a sunset resource. An energy-educated person will tell them to give their heads a shake or to get an actual education in how energy is produced and which energy sources have environmental footprints. To be clear, every energy source has an environmental footprint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292984">At this moment, we, Canadians in particular, are betting that the environmental effects caused by greenhouse gases are worse than those produced by other energy sources, as in the soot and greenhouse gases produced from a burning biomass or as in the full scale build out required for an electricity grid that currently has no replacement source of electricity here or around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292985">Damming all the rivers in the world will not replace the energy we use and has its own environmental impacts. The steel, aluminum, concrete, copper, nickel, aggregate, rare earth metals and construction industries, all heavy on emissions, will free us from our power needs. We are deluding ourselves. The government is a cheerleader in this pretense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292986">Sometimes we get to see some sense of reality emerge when the vanity of the slogans we have heard for five years meet up with the wall of reality. Such seemed to be the case early in this pandemic. The government seemed to indicate that, yes, this industry, the world's environmentally leading oil and gas extraction industry, heavily regulated to ensure it meets the exacting environmental standards of Canadians, would withstand the economic downturn. There was the short pause of attacking the industry with obfuscation and opaque regulations and indeterminate timelines for decision-making when the government might need to admit how important this industry is to Canadians, and to the world, particularly with respect to our environmental practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292987">Believe me, for a country that produces less than 5% of the world's oil supply, we lead by example, environmentally and with respect to society's outcomes. Show me industry participants around the world whose practices are as sound, as transparent, as responsive and as progressive as the Canadian oil and gas industry. There are none.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292988">Madam Speaker, it is an important question. We all know Canada's resource sector workers and suppliers have been hard hit by the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nowhere has this been more pronounced than in the petroleum sector, where producers have faced the added challenge of record low prices caused by the dual impact of a price war and a collapse in demand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292989">The success of Canada's energy sector is critical to the successful restart and recovery of the economy, and that is why our government moved swiftly last spring with more than $2.5 billion in direct investment in the industry to create and protect good jobs while strengthening the industry's environmental performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292990">This new funding includes more than $1.7 billion to clean up orphaned and inactive oil and gas wells in the three western provinces, which will create an expected 5,200 jobs in Alberta alone and provide lasting environmental benefits. We have also launched a $750-million emissions reduction fund to lower greenhouse gases and, in particular, methane emissions in Canada's oil and gas sector. This new fund includes $75 million to help the offshore industry in Newfoundland and Labrador create and maintain jobs through pollution reduction efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292991">Just last month, the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> announced a further investment to support jobs and ensure a sustainable long-term, low-emitting future for the province's offshore oil industry. At the same time, we expanded credit and liquidity supports for mid-market companies through the business credit availability program and established the large employer emergency financing facility, or LEEFF, to assist Canada's larger companies. We have also taken action to directly sustain workers in all sectors through the Canada emergency wage subsidy. For oil and gas workers in Alberta, this crucial support meant sustaining 60,000 jobs at the height of the crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292992">Our government has consistently said that the success of Canada's energy sector is critical to the successful restart and recovery of the economy, and our unprecedented efforts during this challenging time reflect that. This pandemic has reminded us of the power of individual choices and collective will. Governments at all levels, regardless of political stripes, are working together to ensure all Canadians have the vital protection and support they need when they need it most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292993">Our government will continue to pursue all avenues to ensure Canada's energy sector continues to be a key source of good jobs that support a strong economy in Canada. We are supporting workers. We are supporting families, and we are supporting all Albertans and all workers in the energy sector.</ParaText>

More than half a million more Canadians and their families are nervously watching during a pandemic as their government continues to act nonsensically toward their industry, seemingly indifferent to global realities or the effect its inaction will have on the families, lives, futures and health of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6292995">These Canadians, bewildered by the insouciance of the Liberal government, are questioning, in ways they have never questioned before, the way this country makes decisions. These workers and this industry, which collectively contributed over $200 billion to Canadian social and economic development over the past decade and contributed to the world's environmental advancements, are now having their concerns swept aside. At this time this industry's prosperity, in a transparent and open democracy, such as Canada has been, are paramount for how the world emerges from a great pandemic. We need something better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6292999">Madam Speaker, as the member of Parliament whose riding includes Garrison Petawawa, the largest army base in Canada, I am concerned with the health and well-being of each member of the Canadian Armed Forces. I am similarly concerned with the people employed at Arnprior Aerospace, who work in the aerospace industry and supply our military with the tools to do its job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293000">Earlier this month, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> an important question regarding Canadian jobs, procurement and protecting the lives of our women and men in uniform. Canada's aerospace industry and its value chain contribute more than $20 billion in GDP and 160,000 jobs to the Canadian economy annually. In my Ottawa Valley riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Arnprior Aerospace is a leading aerospace manufacturer. It has the capacity and skill sets to supply quality products to companies like Boeing and others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293001">As the Canadian government considers bids for the next generation of fighter jets, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to stand up for Canadian jobs. Canadian workers and taxpayers want the government to publicly commit to disqualifying bidders that take business away from Canadian companies like Arnprior Aerospace during these difficult economic times. Canadian taxpayers are opposed to funding manufacturing jobs in Mexico or elsewhere, which is what some fighter jet aircraft bidders will do unless they are told no. Canadians deserve much better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293002">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cared about the lives of the women and men serving their country in uniform, particularly as we approach Remembrance Day, he would admit to Canadians that his defence policy is a scam. “Weak, Insecure, Disengaged” is the appropriate name of the Liberal government defence plan unveiled in 2017. While it announced billions for Canada's military over the next 20 years, who will be in the chamber 20 years from now to remind Canadians of another broken Liberal promise?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293003">It is important to remind Canadians that the jet fighter replacement program dates back to 1997, when Jean Chrétien was prime minister and the decision was made to join with our allies in the joint strike fighter program. That would have seen Canada replace our aging fighter jet fleet with the fifth generation F-35. It is ironic that when the government attacks the former Conservative government over fighter jet procurement, it is in fact attacking Chrétien and his government's choice for a replacement fighter jet, a decision the previous Conservative government honoured. Here we are 23 years later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293004"> This was not the first time a Liberal government has used military procurement as a political football to kick around. Remembrance Day is a tough time for the families who lost loved ones during the war on terrorism in Afghanistan. They do not forget that it was the decision by the Liberal Party to use military procurement, in this case replacing aging helicopters, during the 1993 election that meant our soldiers lacked strategic lift to avoid roadside bombs. The Chrétien Liberals' decision to cancel the Sea King replacement helicopter, the EH-101, was a cynical political act to get elected on the backs of the women and men who serve their country in uniform. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293005">I remember the faces of the soldiers who died when their convoys drove over the roadside bombs. When the Liberals took office in 1993 and cancelled the Conservative order for replacement helicopters under circumstances like the F-35 debate, they paid $478 million in penalties and set off a 20-year delay in finding a replacement helicopter. That does not count the lives we lost as a result.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6293006">Madam Speaker, let me start by saying that we obviously recognize Canada's aerospace industry as an engine for innovation, economic activity and high-skilled employment. The aerospace industry contributes $25 billion to Canada's GDP and over 210,000 jobs to our economy. It is ranked number one in terms of research and development among Canadian manufacturing industries. Its footprint is national in scope, with important aerospace clusters in every region of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293007">The aerospace industry is export-driven, with approximately 70% of total production exported, and Canadian aerospace firms, including small and medium-sized enterprises, are well integrated into global supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293008">I really appreciate the question posed and the comments made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252603" Type="2">Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke</Affiliation>, because the Canadian aerospace manufacturing sector, with businesses like Arnprior Aerospace, creates good jobs for Canadians in the Ottawa Valley, in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="252653" Type="2">Pontiac</Affiliation> and beyond. I am a neighbour to the member's riding, so I understand quite well how important this is to her constituency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293009">Our government is engaged with industry and has been proactive in promoting Canada's aerospace sector. We have been successful in securing strategic investments in advanced technologies, driving innovation and maintaining highly skilled jobs in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293010">We are going to continue to attract and support new, quality investments in the aerospace sector. For example, we announced nearly $885 million in funding to support the aerospace and space industries through innovation programs. With regard to procurement, we are continuing to engage with Canadian industry on upcoming defence procurement programs to help drive investments in Canada's key industrial capabilities through the industrial and technological benefits, or ITB, policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293011">The ITB policy allows the federal government's significant purchasing power to support Canadian companies and their workers. Through this policy, our government leverages major defence and Coast Guard procurements to create jobs, drive innovation and foster economic growth all across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293012">When a company wins a defence contract, for every dollar that it receives, it is required to reinvest a dollar back into Canada's economy. What does that look like? That reinvestment means that Canadian small and medium-sized businesses, which make up nearly 90% of the firms in Canada's defence industry, have opportunities to do business with prime contractors. These are business opportunities that can translate into long-term and sustainable work that is directly related to specific defence procurements. It is work that helps these businesses integrate into the global supply chains of aerospace and defence multinationals, and work that helps build and strengthen the strategic partnerships between Canadian business and Canada's research community to advance Canadian innovations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293013">One recent example of our government leveraging successful industrial outcomes through procurement was the arrival of the first aircraft of Canada's future fixed-wing search and rescue fleet. This project has created hundreds of new jobs for Canadians. The CC-295 contractor, Airbus Defence and Space, continues to make investments in the Canadian aerospace and defence industry through the ITB policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293014">Strategic work packages directly related to the aircraft are providing Canadian companies the opportunity to participate in global supply chains and create high-value jobs in aerospace manufacturing, simulation and training, propulsion, and in-service support sectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6293015">The success of the ITB policy is concrete. It touches many small and medium-sized businesses from coast to coast to coast. The 2020 annual report on the impact of the ITB policy shows that, from 2014 to 2018, more than 400 small businesses leveraged over $3.4 billion of ITB commitments as a result of active contracts—</ParaText>
