              <ParaText id="6649952"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="11109060" Type="4">C-271, An Act to amend the Governor General's Act</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-271. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="6649953">He said: Mr. Speaker, the bill that I have the honour of introducing in the House is not complicated and the reasoning behind it is quite simple. If Canada wants to keep its monarchist symbols, then it should only pay them a symbolic salary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649954">It seems to me that one dollar per year to live in a castle, eat like a king, sit on a throne and travel at the taxpayer's expense is enough to make ends meet, particularly when there are no other bills to pay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649955">The ideal scenario would be to have no monarchy at all. If we are all equal, then I think that the concept of being the humble subjects of Her Majesty the Queen no longer has its place today. However, in order to make that change, we would have to reopen the Constitution, which the Liberals have locked up tight over the years. Since Canada is not going to separate from the British monarchy any time soon and since Quebec will likely be independent before that happens, we could at least make the symbolic nature of that relationship more clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649956">Under the Governor General's Act, the position comes with an annual salary of $270,602, which is indexed as of 2014, meaning that salary could go up to roughly $300,000. It also includes a pension for life afterwards, regardless of the length of the term. That is a lot of money to most people. This means that Ms. Payette, who served in the role for only a short time, will get a pension for life and will be reimbursed for all her expenses. This is like winning the cash-for-life lottery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649957">Ms. Payette, who was not a good boss, began her reign of terror at Rideau Hall after being appointed in 2017. According to a recent investigation report on the terrible work environment, witnesses reported yelling and screaming, aggressive behaviour, degrading comments and public humiliation. I think we would all agree that such behaviour should not be rewarded with a life-long pension. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649958">Adrienne Clarkson, who was governor general from 1999 to 2005, has claimed over $1 million in expenses since her departure, in addition to her full pension. The reason given, according to a La Presse article from October 31, 2018, deserves a long, hard look. Here is what it said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649959">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Besides their pensions, former governors general get lifetime public funding for office and travel expenses through a program that has existed since 1979, on the premise that governors general never truly retire.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649960">Oh, sure, governors general never truly retire. No doubt their schedules are packed after retirement because, as we all know, everybody wants a chance to see these superstars, these former governors general of Canada. Seriously. Nobody even knows the point of their existence while they are in office. Are we supposed to believe they serve an even greater purpose after their term in office?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649961">Michaëlle Jean found another job, and it is a real job that does not involve speechifying while going ballistic about a lack of hot water in a hotel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649962">Other than acting like monarchs and pretending they have any political importance whatsoever, governors general play a purely symbolic role, so the Bloc Québécois suggests that they receive a symbolic salary of $1 per year. They do not need more than that anyway. Our proposal is actually moderate considering that Quebeckers want to get rid of the monarchy altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649963">Even Canadians are waking up to the fact that the monarchy is pointless. According to a Leger poll, 74% of Quebeckers want to abolish the monarchy and just 12% want to keep it. That means 88% of Quebeckers feel zero attachment to this symbol of submission. According to another survey published in La Presse, three out of five Canadians want to abolish the position of governor general or at least scale back the responsibilities associated with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649964">What responsibilities are we talking about? All a governor general has to do is sit down, listen to speeches, receive the prime minister when he announces an election, and assent to legislation that does not even concern the Crown. This ridiculous protocol that is out of step with reality could even seem amusing if it were not that we pay for all the pomp and ceremony. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649965">This position is far from being symbolic because there is a lot of money, $67 million a year, allocated for an unelected official whose main role is to remind us that we are humble subjects of the British Crown. That is the price tag of our relationship with the Crown, which comes out to $2 per person. We pay $2 to kneel before the monarchy. If we could cut this absurd expense a bit, it would be better than nothing. We could at least do something useful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649966">In the government's recent budget, $50 million is allocated to the forest bioeconomy over two years. The annual amount of $25 million for forestry is a little more than a third of what goes out for the monarchy. That is rather ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649967">The government is investing $25 million a year in the forestry sector and gives $67 million for the Governor General. The forest is a powerful symbol. It is rather current and represents the future. The forest and the wood it provides allows us to create nice things, more than the monarchy does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649968">Speaking of symbol and speaking of the forest, there is also the symbol of the maple leaf. It is a symbol that Canada stole from Quebec because there are hardly any sugar maples in the rest of Canada. Imagine if the Quebec flag bore a symbol representing oil. That would make no sense. Anyway, it is not the only thing Canada has ever stolen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649969">Some $67 million annually is allocated to the Crown. How much money has been allocated to our sugar shacks, which have lost two seasons to the pandemic? Not one cent has been allocated to save the symbolic maple leaf. The money that should be going to our sugar shacks goes to the British Crown instead because there is always enough money for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649970">We have a good, real opportunity here to clean up these completely ridiculous expenses for an outdated and unequal position. It is completely arbitrary. The governor general resigned and no one else has been appointed. The chief justice of the Supreme Court inherited the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649971">If ever there was a time to reflect on whether we need a governor general, now would be the time. Nothing has changed. No one seems bothered. There has been no revolution and people are not protesting in the streets demanding that a new governor general be appointed quickly, since no one wants that. Because it would take a constitutional amendment to get rid of the position of governor general, we can at least remove some the benefits by paying a symbolic salary with no pension. That is what I am proposing in my bill. I would propose getting rid of the position altogether, erasing any reference to the monarchy, cutting wasteful spending, like the little prince and princess did when they went to live in California. They were able to cut ties, and I do not see why we could not do the same. The Constitution does not allow us to do so, and that is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649972">I went into politics because I believe in Quebec. I believe in its independence. I advocate for its independence, and I will be there the day it becomes independent. I believe in a francophone Quebec that is free and that has no king or queen. The British monarchy and Canada's attachment to it also serve as a reminder of the conquest. The symbol that Canada is so fond of is the symbol of the British victory over the French. The song <I>God Save the Queen</I> and the unicorn on the coat of arms are symbols that mean very little to me. Perhaps they are a nice symbol for Canada and many members of the House, but for me and many of my colleagues, it is a symbol of colonization and stolen land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649973">Without the monarchy, there is only one true master and that is the people. We will never be a real and complete democracy as long as the people have to ask the royal representative whether they can vote, to recognize the validity of the results and to sanction our laws. Some members will say that the role is strictly symbolic. If that is the case, then they should vote in favour of my bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649974">Barbados cut ties with the British Crown, but it is still the kingdom of tax havens. Australia is still thinking it over. Canada seems unable to do it, but we have an opportunity to send a clear signal. If we do not do it, we will miss an excellent opportunity. A vacancy in the position of governor general does not come along every day. Let us take advantage of it and cut these extravagant expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649975">Before I wrap up my speech, I want to say that this will probably be my last speech in the House of Commons. Against all odds, I was elected in 2015 thanks to voters who care about Quebec. It has been an honour to serve my country, Quebec, as the representative of a patriotic riding. It is an honour I will cherish for the rest of my life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649976">I want to thank my wife, Johanie, who has made many sacrifices because she knows our cause is just. I am grateful for her tireless support, and I want her to know that I love her. I also want to thank my children and tell them that this is the last time. From now on, I will be home for good.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6649978">In regard to his speech and his intervention today, when he talks about removing these benefits from the Governor General, would he be suggesting that be done from this point forward, or is that retroactive? If so, would it be retroactive just to the past Governor General, or all Governors General past? I am just curious, if the member can expand on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6649980">As for the former governor general, the problem is that the institution itself is so flawed. Funding is being used to support an archaic institution. If I had my druthers, not one red cent would ever have been given to the British Crown, but that is what the bill calls for going forward. From this point on, governors general would no longer receive a salary or a pension. Some former governors general have won the jackpot.</ParaText>

Of course, as was articulated just before he finished his speech, that very well could have been his last speech in the House, so I would like to congratulate him for his time and his service on behalf of his constituents and, indeed, his family for the sacrifices they have made to allow him to be in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649994">This private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11109060" Type="4">C-271, an act to amend the Governor General’s Act</Document>, really deals with the constitutional monarchy and the traditions we have in this country. Let me start by recognizing the important role that our monarchy has played in our history, including our democratic functions here in the House and across the board. I am going to take a different tack with a type of appreciation for our shared history. That is not to say that the member does not have his own points and values on this, but I hope that by the end of my 10 minutes he might come to appreciate that there is an important role for the governor general’s office and for our shared ties to the United Kingdom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649995">I recently had a conversation with a constituent of mine, Sir Graham Day. For my colleagues who may not know, he is an excellent Canadian. He has served on many corporate boards, has had a lot of leadership roles in the charitable non-profit sector and was the last Canadian ever knighted for his service to two different United Kingdom governments during the 1970s and 1980s. We had a conversation at his house and talked about the important role the governor general plays.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649996"> As the member opposite for <Affiliation DbId="252686" Type="2">Mirabel</Affiliation> mentioned, sometimes Canadians see the role that the governor general's office plays as being simply symbolic. I would admit that this role over time has become more symbolic, but it still has important underpinnings for our democracy. I will get to those in a moment. In my conversation with Sir Graham Day, we talked about the important role that this office plays and what it means to Canadian democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649997"> I would also highlight conversations I have had with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation>, the first Mi'kmaq parliamentarian in the House. He talks about the importance of the role of the Crown and of the treaties established across the country. These all tie back to the United Kingdom and, in some cases, predate Canadian Confederation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649998">While the <Affiliation DbId="252686" Type="2">member</Affiliation> opposite suggests that this role is symbolic or does not necessarily resonate across the country, I disagree. This is the foundation of how our country came to be. It is our shared history, both with its bright points and darker points. Hopefully, my colleagues will agree that if we come from the premise that the ties we share with the Commonwealth and with the British Crown are important for our country, then so is the role of the governor general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6649999">My concern with the private member's bill that has been put forward is that it seems to erode the importance of that role. I will get to that in a moment, but the suggestion is that this role is worth $1 per year. That is the crux of it. Of course, it is not surprising. The member spoke quite passionately as someone who wants Quebec to be an independent country, and sees this as problematic. I do not. That is not to say that there should not be a conversation around remuneration, or about how perhaps the governor general's office could be reformed. However, the role is not just symbolic. It has legitimate purposes in Canadian society. The suggestion that the role is worth $1 a year is tantamount to saying that it is not important, which I would disagree with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650000">I want to talk about the role today. Canadians watching at home need to understand exactly how the governor general's office is remunerated. My hon. colleague touched on this to a certain extent. Under the Governor General's Act, it is about $270,000 a year, indexed for inflation. As I understand it, that means the governor general receives about $330,000 a year in base salary, with a pension indexed to inflation of about $150,000 a year and, of course, expense accounts that are at the discretion of the office of the secretary to the governor general. That is the remuneration offered to the individual we choose to place our faith in as the governor general.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650001">Do I think the role is worth $1? No. Does it need to be exactly what I just outlined? Not necessarily. We can have conversations around that, because it comes down to the types of individuals we want to draw into this profession: this public service to our country. I am not sure we cannot find quality individuals who would take on this role and its functions in earnest for less than $330,000, with perhaps not the same type of pension. Perhaps an expense account is not needed at this time, although it has been provided in the past as a benefit to governors general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650002">I jumped at the opportunity to speak to this piece of legislation because when Ms. Payette, the outgoing governor general, resigned, I got a lot of calls in my constituency. Kings—Hants can be described generally as blue-collar. The median income in my riding is probably on the second half of the 338 ridings across the country. For individuals living paycheque to paycheque, or seniors who do not have a lot of money at the end of the month, the type of behaviour that was reported did not warrant a $150,000 annuity pension for the rest of Mme. Payette's life. Constituents certainly raised it with me. I generally countered on the phone that I appreciated where constituents were coming from and that we had to understand that this role is important, but maybe there were ways we could reform it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650003">This remuneration to the governor general is on par with other jurisdictions in our Commonwealth, such as Australia and New Zealand. As a parliamentarian, I believe this role is not just symbolic. If we have a hung Parliament, the governor general has to decide who has the ability to govern. Yes, conventions help to dictate that, but it comes down to an individual. If the prime minister walks over to the governor general's office and asks for an election or to dissolve Parliament, that is something an individual has to decide. A constitutional role comes into play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650004">My hon. colleague did not really touch on the separation between the head of state and the government. That is unique in our Commonwealth and has served us very well. Although the governor general's role includes a lot of dialogue, engagement and events with Canadians, it serves a serious function that warrants serious and thoughtful consideration about how we make decisions, in terms of the legislation that is being proposed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650005">As a parliamentarian, I would propose that we look at reform, rather than abolishing the role or giving it a symbolic salary, which is a slap in the face to the role the British monarchy has played in the history of this country. We can look at getting rid of things such as the expense account. I do not know if average Canadians deem that as important, but I would agree with them. We could look at what is an equitable salary to attract individuals of character and integrity who could serve the office well. Perhaps it would be at the current amount, or perhaps that could or should be reviewed over time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650006">I compare this with the Senate. I do not want to speak for all of my colleagues in the House, but generally the position of the New Democratic Party has been that we should abolish the Senate because it does not play an important role, despite the fact that it is the chamber for sober second thought. It certainly plays an important role in regionalism: for Nova Scotia and the Maritimes, the Senate plays an important role in regional representation. The government went about reforming the Senate in a way that makes it more functional. I do not want to speak for all parliamentarians, but I think it has created intrinsic benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650007">It would be beneficial to apply this same type of thinking to how we can make changes and reform the governor general's office and the act. The intent of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252686" Type="2">Mirabel</Affiliation> is perhaps good, but I am not sure the mechanism is the right piece to move forward. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650008">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11109060" Type="4">C-271</Document>, which seeks to amend the Governor General's Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650009">The Bloc Québécois member wants the Governor General to be paid an annual salary of $1 and not be entitled to a pension. I cannot support that.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6650010">The more important question regarding the Governor General is why this bill has even been brought forward, and it is clear to me the reason is that Canadians are angry. They are angry the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> failed to vet Julie Payette. He failed to follow what had been done in previous parliaments, which was to have a committee that selected and vetted the candidates, so we could be sure the candidate for Governor General was actually able to perform the duty well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650011">There was plenty of evidence that Julie Payette was not going to meet that criteria, just from the stories of what was happening from the United States and her previous places of employment, where there were clearly issues similar to the harassment allegations that were brought forward when she was here. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> totally failed to vet her, and so Canadians are rightly angry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650012">I see now that going forward the government has recognized that we do need to have a selection committee. Even though it has a selection committee of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Liberal friends, at least it is a committee that will vet the candidate, which is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650013">The other thing that is clear is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> failed to quickly respond to the allegations of serious harassment that were being made from the time the Governor General was put in place. This behaviour was allowed to go on for years before it was finally addressed. I am not surprised to see that. I am currently at the Standing Committee on the Status of Women studying the sexual misconduct in the military, where, for three years, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> took no action on allegations against General Vance and many of the other sexual misconduct allegations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650014">It is a chronic behaviour, a failure to act, on the part of the Liberal government. Obviously, when it comes to issues of employee performance, there is a documentation process that is usually put in place so one does not have employees who have been a disaster leave the position and receive a pension of $150,000 a year and expenses of $200,000 at the discretion of the government. That is another failure, and Canadians are rightly outraged about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650015">That said, the Governor General's role is an important role. I have attended many of the honouring ceremonies at Rideau Hall, where the Order of Canada is presented, as well as many of the recognitions for excellence in arts and science and the number of the medals of honour that are presented. To recognize excellence in our country is something that is important to Canadians. It is also important to have that role represent our monarchy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650016">Although the Bloc member who spoke earlier is not a fan of the Queen, there are many in Canada who love being part of the Commonwealth, love the Queen and love being part of an institution that has, as the previous speaker pointed out, been essential in the treaties that have been put in place in many of the systems of our democracy that exist. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650017">When it comes to picking a future Governor General, I would really hope the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s committee would consider that the Governor General is here to represent the Queen within Canada. The Queen is the head of the Church of England. It was an absolute affront that the previous Governor General mocked Canadians who believe in God, when she is supposed to be representing the Queen, who is the head of the Church of England. I would hope that, when vetting the next candidate, due consideration is given to a person who can at least respect and represent our monarchy here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650018">In terms of salary, we want to attract an excellent candidate, and a dollar is actually rather insulting for the amount of time the Governor General is required to attend various events, such as the honours I mentioned, and in light of the fact we want somebody who can represent Canada and represent us to the world. It is a very important role, and to get that kind of candidate, we need to have a salary that is commensurate with that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650019">I understand that the salary of $330,000 is what is currently merited. I think that is open to discussion, as the previous member said, but certainly a dollar is far too low for the kind of candidate that we would want. I will also note that the salary is commensurate with other Commonwealth places such as Australia and New Zealand, so it is in line with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650020">In terms of the pension, it is good to have a discussion about pensions. I find that often in government pensions are not commensurate with the private sector. It would not be acceptable in the private sector, after working for five years, to get a pension of $150,000 a year. That would be outrageous. This is something worthy of consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650021">At the same time, in order to attract a good candidate, the salary has to be high. I know there are a lot of discussions about even MPs should not be receiving a pension, but on the other hand, many people taking this position are taking a salary cut in order to serve the public. There is that to consider, and I certainly would be open to discussions about what should happen there. To me, a full pension of $150,000 a year after being in any role for five years is really excessive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650022">In terms of the expense account, it depends what Canadians want the Governor General to do once the Governor General is out of that role. There are some examples where they have taken up charitable causes, but should the taxpayer really be funding that desire of a person to have a charitable cause? As was rightly pointed out, Adrienne Clarkson did spend a million dollars of taxpayer money. There is not a lot of auditing of what is in that expenditure. Canadians have clearly expressed that they are not really willing to continue the pomp and splendour of the Governor General after they have left their position. That should be a consideration when the government considers what it is going to give.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650023">I would say that a better bill would be Senator Claude Carignan's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11215436" Type="4">S-232</Document>, which is hoping to be before the Senate. It has been presented, but with the pandemic, the Senate is consumed with government bills and is not able to pay as much attention to Senate Private Members' Business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650024">That bill says that if the Governor General leaves their position before their term is done for any reason other than a medical reason, that person would not then be eligible for pension or for the expenses that are at the discretion of the government. That is a very good bill because it would correct things going forward to make sure that people serve their role, and if they do, then they receive what is due. However, if the same thing happened that happened with Julie Payette, that person would not be eligible for pension or expenses. In fact, if that went into law, it would not take away the money she has received to date, but it would take away any money in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650025">That is a very good bill brought forward by the senator. Hopefully, we will see the discussion and debate in the Senate, and then it will make its way over to this place, so we could have a discussion. That is where Canadians are. They realize the Governor General's position is important and that it is worthy of pay and worthy of some remuneration, but not in a situation where the Governor General leaves in disgrace and the person is equally meriting that compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650026"> For those who may not be aware, there is a petition my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252525" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation> has put forward, e-petition 3314. It essentially does what Senator Carignan's bill is asking for. It calls on the government to implement the new requirement that, if one does not serve their full five years and leaves for reasons other than medical, they would not receive a pension and would not be eligible for the expenses. I encourage everyone to sign that petition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650027">I am very happy to have been able to speak today about the value of the role of Governor General and to give honour to the many who have served well in that role, such as the Right Hon. David Johnston.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650028">Madam Speaker, as always, it is a great honour to rise and speak in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650029">The discussion regarding the Governor General could have been such an important one for Parliament. Certainly, things went terribly wrong with Madam Julie Payette. The issues of the toxic work environment, the harassment and the incredible amount of financial funding she will be receiving from the taxpayers for the rest of her life are legitimate discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650030">I think there is also a legitimate discussion to have about Canada's role with the monarchy. That would be a very good discussion, but we are not having that discussion because we are dealing with a bill that is essentially a stunt. It is really unfortunate. This is the member's last speech in the House, and he decided that he wanted it to be a stunt. He is treating the Governor General's office as though he has watched too many Disney cartoons and it has the coachmen, the horses and all of that. That is not the reality we are talking about. We are talking about an institution that has a specific role to play within the constitution of Canada. I would like to speak to that this morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650031">I come from a long line of people who are very opposed to the monarchy in Canada. I am proud that I grew up in a family that has deep reservations about Canada's ties to it. I think a conversation about the monarchy is a very fair conversation. However, it does not mean the role of the Governor General is not an important position. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650032">We recognize the Governor General's role of separating the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from the notion of the Crown, however we conceive of the Crown, is an important division of powers. It is very important, and it distinguishes us from how the United States is set up. I think it can serve us well. The issue with Madam Payette is that obviously things went very wrong. This is a woman of extraordinary abilities and skills, but the vetting process was not done properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650033"> I disagree with my colleague in the Conservative Party that the Governor General is here to represent the Queen, who is the head of the Anglican church in England. That is fine for the U.K. I do not care what the Queen represents over there. I do not care what its church and state relations are. For me, one of the roles of the Governor General is to represent Canada on the international stage and to be a voice as our head of state in a symbolic manner. We have to very wisely and carefully choose people who reflect and understand the diversity of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650034"> In defence of Madam Payette, I saw her speak on the international stage, and she was extraordinary. The 75th anniversary of the landings at Normandy was a very powerful time because the international community was gathered there. When we were in Europe, in the French and German media, there was definitely a big question about what the future of the alliance that freed Europe in 1944 and 1945 would be. This was with Brexit and Boris Johnson pulling the U.K. out of Europe. At that time we also had Donald Trump and the scene that America was walking away. There were a lot of questions when we were over in Normandy about what the vision would be for a unified common front to address our issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650035"> Madam Payette gave a speech that was extraordinary. I think it really moved people from the international community, and certainly the people of Normandy. She talked about what enormous sacrifices it took to build the post-war order of peace and the number of deaths and the amount of suffering the Second World War entailed to get us to a place where we understood that international norms and standards had to be the code. She also talked about how easy it would be to let that all slip away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650036">I mention that because it is worth recognizing that Madam Payette brought enormous skills to her capacity as Governor General. Her problem was the toxic work environment, the abuse of staff and the harassment. There are many famous and powerful people who treat staff in a brutal and unacceptable manner. We have the #MeToo movement because of it. In 2021, it is very important to say, and it does not matter how talented public officials are or what role they serve, that the issue of toxic work environments needs to be addressed. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650037">Out of what happened with Madam Payette, I was hoping we would have heard the government lay down some ground rules for how we would deal with the Governor General, and that has not happened. I was hoping that the government would lay down some ground rules for proper vetting, to make sure that we are never in this situation again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650038">It raises a serious question, in terms of the remuneration that Madam Payette is going to receive, in terms of a pension for life and an expense account for life. My belief is that if someone left their post because they failed in the obligations they had, they should not be in a position to simply expect a cheque for life. To me, that is a breach with the Canadian people and the trust that the Canadian people put into this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650039"> Canadian people do not pay much attention to the salary, pension and expenses of the Governor General because we assume that they are going to do the right thing. The right thing in this situation is that Madam Payette was forced to step down because of the toxic work environment that happened on her watch, and she was not eligible. We could have had that discussion today, but we did not. That is unfortunate. A bill in the House to talk about the terms that we sign a Governor General up for would be very helpful and positive, and would reassure the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650040">In 1999, I followed the Queen on a national tour working as a journalist, and as I said, I come from a long line of Scottish anti-monarchists. One of the issues that really struck me was that the Queen worked very hard. Another one of the things that really struck me was the relationship that indigenous people in Canada had with the notion of the Crown and the Queen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650041">We have historic connections with the U.K. We could choose to change those arrangements, and that is perfectly within our rights. We could modernize them, and that is perfectly within our rights. We could have better systems of accountability, and that is something we are obligated to do. However, I do not think it helps to treat this as some kind of stunt and say that we are going to just pay the Governor General $1. Maybe the Bloc is perfectly fine with billionaires like Galen Weston being able to step up, but if we are going to have a Governor General, they have to be paid and they have to be paid a pension, because they have changed their lives, representing Canada. They can never just go back to being who they were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650042">This idea of paying them $1 is a joke. It is not serious. It is why I do not take this bill seriously. I am not going to spend much more time talking about it, because I think it is a waste of parliamentary effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650043">I do want to say that it is really unfortunate that the member referred to Madam Payette as the “little lady”. These are forms of degrading women in public life that have no place. She has certainly done a hell of a lot more in her life than the member opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650044"> Whether we agree with the Governor General or not, whether we have problems with how the Governor General operated, it is about showing respect. As I said, I come from a long line of anti-monarchists, but I show respect for the institution because it is the institution we have. The voters sent me here to work within the institutions we have, to build them up or to change them. Changing some of those institutions is much the work of Parliament right now. This bill, unfortunately, is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650045"> If there had been changes to the bill, if the bill had been about the vetting process, the pension or expenses, I would certainly have been more than willing to support it going forward. At this point, I see this bill as little more than a publicity stunt.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6650046">Madam Speaker, I listened to the comments of my colleagues from the other parties about the bill introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252686" Type="2">Mirabel</Affiliation>. I must say that I was disappointed, but not necessarily surprised. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650047">The purpose of Bill <Document DbId="11109060" Type="4">C-271</Document> is to amend the Governor General's Act to primarily do two things. The first is to set the annual salary of the Queen's representative at $1. If this could be done for the Queen, that might not be a bad idea either. The second is to repeal part II of the act in order to remove the Governor General's right to a retiring annuity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650048">The role of the Governor General is to represent Queen Elizabeth II, Canada's sovereign and head of state. We have to wonder if we really need that. We already know that the answer is no, but for now we are stuck with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650049">Some will say that we absolutely do need a governor general and that they will lose sleep if we do not have one. I do not get it at all, because I do not know many people in Quebec who think about the Governor General on a daily basis other than to rage about how much it all costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650050">The Governor General is appointed by the Prime Minister. However, they say there is a separation of powers. In general, prime ministerial appointments are somewhat political because prime ministers do not appoint their adversaries. In any event, that is what happened in the past. The people who were appointed were highly partisan, highly federalist types, people who had chaired the “No” campaign during the referendum, including David Johnston and Lise Thibault. So much for being a non-partisan position. The facts show that that is not really the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650051">When an individual is appointed by the Prime Minister, they are somewhat beholden to the Prime Minister. They cannot forget that it is thanks to the Prime Minister that they have a fat pension and a big salary. In return, that person tries not to make any trouble for the Prime Minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650052">Unfortunately, even if the Governor General wanted to cause trouble, they do not have much power. On paper, the Governor General's roles are to serve as commander-in-chief of the army, grant royal assent to acts passed by the House of Commons and the Senate, sign official documents, read the throne speech, swear the Prime Minister, the chief justice of Canada and cabinet ministers into office, and appoint lieutenant governors, who represent the Queen in the provinces and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650053">I do not see why all of these roles are so important or why they should be played by the Governor General. We can get back to this later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650054">Julie Payette was asked whether her position was relevant. Curiously enough, she, the Governor General, was unable to justify the existence of her own job. When she was asked this question in 2013, she responded that she did not think it was appropriate for her to answer the question. Essentially, she was so uncomfortable saying that this position she held was pointless that she evaded the question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650055">The Governor General receives an annual salary of over $270,000, which is a lot of money, plus an expense account. However, that is not all. There is also a pension of $150,000 a year for life. Furthermore, the role of the Governor General is not limited to the person of the Governor General. There is a whole support team. Royal duties come with plenty of royal pageantry. The Governor General's ostentatious swearing-in ceremony can cost millions of dollars. Receptions are held at the drop of a hat and, obviously, the Governor General is not serving guests Kraft Dinner and hot dogs, but food that is probably a lot more sophisticated and costly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650056">The Governor General also gets a limousine and an official residence. The Queen's representative needs somewhere to live, but not just any place. It has to be a royal residence. The Governor General's residence is costing us a lot of money in upkeep. The government has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, sometimes more, in maintaining it. The Governor General also goes to lots of cocktail parties here, there and everywhere, so they need a car or even a plane for transportation. Since Canada is a big country, sometimes the Governor General has to travel long distances.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650057">All that ends up costing a bundle. In addition, the Governor General also needs security guards. Money is being spent all over the place. For fiscal year 2019-20, which was a normal year, the operating costs amounted to $34 million, and that was for a Governor General who did not go out much or do very much, according to recent media reports. I would like to see the numbers for her predecessors, because I can imagine that being quite a hefty bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650058">For a person who serves a symbolic function, I find that pretty pricey given that their main job is signing bills. I feel like maybe we do not need to spend $34 million on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650059">In addition, as I pointed out earlier, former governors general receive a pension of $150,000 a year. Moreover, the spending does not end when the individual leaves the position, because former governors general have the right to quietly continue billing up to $100,000 a year. At some point, someone noticed that these expenses were hidden in a section of the Public Accounts of Canada labelled “temporary help services”, and it does not even say who requested this help. The best part is that these expenditures are referred to as temporary help services, yet former governors general receive their pensions for life and they have access to these help services for life. I just do not understand why this would be classified as temporary. Perhaps we will get an answer to that question one day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650060">On top of costing us $150,000 a year, former governors general gladly continue to invoice us for all kinds of office and moving expenses, in addition to expenses that may or may not be connected to their former duties as governor general. Imagine that a baseball club wants to invite a former governor general to hand out medals. There were media reports that former governor general Adrienne Clarkson has no problem invoicing the maximum $100,000 every year. That is how it works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650061">We have seen other similar cases in Quebec, including a former lieutenant governor, a position that is basically pointless and similar to the governor general's but at the Quebec level. A previous office holder, Lise Thibault, made a name for herself hosting a television show called <I>De bien belles choses</I>, or “very nice things”. In one episode, interestingly enough, she taught people how to entertain on a small budget. People were surprised by what happened later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650062">In my youth, throughout the 1990s, 2000s and even the early 2010s, I remember seeing reports on television and in the newspaper about all the overspending and excesses of people who served in roles similar to the lieutenant governor's. There were reports of misspending, auditor general investigations, National Assembly investigations, perhaps even House of Commons investigations. The individuals under investigation managed to get away with it every time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650063">Lise Thibault did not manage to get away with it, though she tried her best in court. She even went so far as to invoke the principle that “the Queen can do no wrong”, arguing that lieutenant governors are so royal that they too can do no wrong. Unfortunately, it did not work. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her 10 years of swindling taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650064">In the end, however, she never paid anyone back. The hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars she wasted were gone for good, even though that money belonged to the people working at McDonald's, at the local canteen, at the corner store or in shops. I am upset and frustrated by that. In my opinion, when we are looking for savings, we need to pay attention when spending that kind of money and think about the people working hard to pay for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650065">It did not stop there, because then it was Michaëlle Jean's turn. She also made headlines for her expensive tastes and startling lifestyle, such as taking a limousine to travel just down the street. However, that was not enough, because after leaving office, she had to maintain her lifestyle. In addition to her pension, the government also decided to appoint her Secretary General of the International Organisation of La Francophonie, allowing her to travel the world by ship with some young people. I do not know whether that accomplished much in the end, but the government wanted to keep her active, at taxpayer expense once again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650090">It is a privilege for me to rise in support of budget 2021, “A Recovery Plan for Jobs, Growth and Resilience”. I would like to use my time to highlight how the budget will invest in Canadian youth, which is an issue that matters very much to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650091">This budget will help young Canadians recover from the COVID-19 recession through easier access to post-secondary education and good jobs. In many ways, COVID-19 has been a sacrifice of younger generations to protect their elders. Many young people have lost their jobs, and many have had to stay home at a time of life when they would normally have been studying, enjoying time with friends, and getting a foothold in the job market. Young people were among the hardest and fastest hit when the pandemic struck. They have experienced more job losses than any other age demographic and the worst decline in mental health of any age group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650092">We cannot let them be a lost generation. Young Canadians must be at the centre of our recovery. Their future depends on it, and so does the future of all Canadians. The future success of today's young Canadians will be critical for Canada's success tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650093">Budget 2021 proposes $5.7 billion in government investments to help young Canadians. There are many examples, and I would like to highlight a few of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650094"> For example, budget 2021 proposes more than $4 billion in investments to make student debt easier to pay down and provide support to students with the greatest need. First, waiving interest on student loans for an additional year will help 1.5 million people. Second, increasing the threshold for repayment assistance means that nobody earning $40,000 per year or less will need to make any payments on their student loans. Third, the budget proposes to double the Canada student grants for an additional two years. Fourth, the budget expands access to disability supports for students whose disabilities are persistent but not permanent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650095">Education is the smartest investment anyone can make. Naturally, we are helping young people make that investment, and it begins well before college or university. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has made life especially difficult for students at risk of dropping out of school. They rely on local programs for counselling and tutoring, but because of the pandemic, donations to local organizations have dried up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650096">To help these groups fulfill their mission, budget 2021 proposes to invest $118 million to pilot after-school programming. This would support national and local organizations that help the most vulnerable youth graduate high school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650097">That being said, the support that the budget is offering to young Canadians is not limited to education. We are also proposing measures to make it easier for graduates to join the workforce. As I was saying earlier, young Canadians have been hit hard by job losses due to COVID-19. Measures included in the budget will help young people and students connect with employers and gain the job skills that will serve them all their lives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650098">The new funding would increase the number of work placements available through the student work placement program to 50,000. It would also increase the wage subsidy available for employers and increase employers' ability to access the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650099"> The budget also proposes to invest in the youth employment and skills strategy to better meet the needs of vulnerable youth. This would support 7,000 additional job placements for youth, on top of the 30,600 placements that will be created with the funding announced in last fall's economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650100">In addition, the budget proposes funding for 75,000 job placements in 2022-23 through the Canada summer jobs program. In total, this budget would create 215,000 new job skills development opportunities for young Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650101">The budget proposes measures for education and employment, but it also includes measures to improve quality of life. As I said, young people have experienced the worst decline in mental health during the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650102">The budget proposes to provide $100 million to support mental health interventions for populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including youth, as well as health care workers, front-line workers, seniors, racialized and Black Canadians, and indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650103"> Speaking of indigenous people, budget 2021 would help advance reconciliation with first nations, Inuit and the Métis nation. The funds allocated would enhance transportation for first nations students and increase first nations control over first nations education. The funding would also extend COVID-19 support so children on reserve can continue to attend school safely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650104">We are also proposing to enhance the Inuit and Métis nation post-secondary education strategies and the post-secondary student support program for first nations students. This would help offset the income that many students lost because of the pandemic and would help them pay for tuition, textbooks, housing and other living expenses. The money would also support indigenous-led post-secondary educational institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650105">Unemployment among young people is now 14%, compared to 7.5% among Canadians as a whole. We need some concrete action, and this will start with budget 2021. This budget will make college and university more accessible and affordable. It will help young Canadians launch their careers. It also proposes measures to address an issue that is very important to young Canadians, and that is the fight against climate change. The budget proposes to invest towards a green recovery to create jobs and build a clean economy. This green economy is our legacy to the youth of today and tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650106">For all these reasons, I support budget 2021, and I urge all members to support it too.</ParaText>

Right now, in Quebec, 450,000 households are in urgent need of housing, 250,000 households spend more than 50% of their income on housing and 82,000 households spend more than 80% of their income on housing. That is outrageous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650131">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to budget 2021 today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650132">In 2019, our government was elected for a second time, with the commitment to invest in the things that matter most to Canadians: healthcare, child care, affordable housing, creating good well-paying jobs, support for seniors and families, and protecting the environment. Budget 2021 makes important investments to deliver on our commitment and continue to build on the work we have done to support Canadians during the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650133">This past year has been an extraordinarily difficult time for Canadians and people around the world. COVID-19 has changed the way we do everything, including how the House of Commons operates. Over the last year, there has been a historic flow of federal aid to brace the financial foundations of businesses and households across Canada. Budget 2021 lays the groundwork for a strong post-pandemic recovery and outlines spending for critical measures aimed at getting our country through the third wave of the pandemic and stimulating the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650134"> Canada entered the global pandemic in a strong fiscal position, which has allowed our government to provide unprecedented support for Canadians. Budget 2021 is a progressive budget that lays out a clear plan to ensure that Canada builds back better by focusing on three main fundamental challenges: keeping Canadians safe, recovering from immediate pain and rebuilding for the long term. I cannot possibly speak about all the investments in the budget, so I will highlight just a few. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650135">Our government has been there to support Canadians through the pandemic from day one, and we know there is a need for more immediate spending to address the third wave of COVID-19, which is hitting hard. This will be done through the extension of key subsidy programs. With variants of concern spreading and COVID-19 case counts on the rise, budget 2021 includes a three-month extension of the federal wage and rent subsidies. Set to expire in June, the supports will now be available through September, at a cost of approximately $12 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650136">The pandemic has been called a “she-cession” because women have been disproportionately impacted. It has shone a light on the need for safe, affordable child care and early learning. This need is not new. We have known since 50 years ago that the number one thing holding women back in the workforce is access to child care. In the last Parliament, as vice-chair of the status of women committee, I too recognized that child care would allow women to participate fully in the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650137">Thirty-one years ago, when my son was born, I had three months of maternity leave. I worked in real estate investment banking, and when it came time to return to work, I realized the cost of child care was too expensive to make it worthwhile. I called my boss and told him that while I wanted to return to work, it did not make financial sense. He said he would double my salary to start and told me that I could take whatever time I needed if my son was sick. I recognize that I was incredibly privileged to have a boss that was willing to do that, and even though he was incredibly generous over the years and was always true to his word about time off work, child care was a constant worry. That is why our investments in early learning and child care are so important to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650138">As part of a feminist economic policy, budget 2021 proposes to provide $30 billion over five years, and $8.3 billion per year thereafter, to build a high-quality, affordable and accessible early learning and child care system across Canada. This funding will allow for a 50% reduction in average fees for regulated early learning and child care in all provinces outside of Quebec, to be delivered by the end of 2022. It will also ensure annual growth in quality and affordable child care spaces across the country, ensuring high-quality early learning and child care, for an average of $10 a day. This is social infrastructure that will drive jobs and growth. It is feminist economic policy. It is smart economic policy that will increase Canada’s GDP by 1.2%, allowing more women to return to the workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650139">Cancer is a leading cause of disease-related death in Canadian children. More targeted research is needed to help save lives. Budget 2021 proposes to provide $30 million over two years to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to fund pediatric cancer research that can lead to better outcomes and healthier lives for these young patients. The funding will support promising research projects with the greatest potential for fighting pediatric cancer. I know too many children like Ayverie Caster, Carson Clapham and Teagan Walsh, who were lost to this terrible disease. I am so proud of the work being done at SickKids by Dr. David Malkin, who is fighting childhood cancer, and look forward to what he and others can do with this new funding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650140">A recommendation that came out of the Halton round tables on youth vaping I have hosted over the last two years was the need for a tax on vaping products. Budget 2021 proposes to introduce a new taxation framework for the imposition of excise duties on vaping products in 2022. The federal government will work with any province and territory that may be interested in a federally coordinated approach to taxing these products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650141">I have had the pleasure of working with Diabetes Canada and Mike Swartz from my riding to advance the need for investments in a national framework for diabetes. Budget 2021 proposes to provide $25 million over five years, starting in 2021-22, to Health Canada for additional investments for research on diabetes, including in juvenile diabetes, surveillance, prevention and to work toward the development of a national framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650142">Budget 2021 also proposes to provide $10 million over five years for a new diabetes challenge prize. This initiative will help surface novel approaches to diabetes prevention and promote the development and testing of new interventions to reduce the risks associated with type 2 diabetes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650143">As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous Services, I am pleased to see the historic investments for indigenous peoples and their businesses included in budget 2021. Through this budget, we are proposing historic new investments of over $18 billion over the next five years to improve the quality of life and create new opportunities for people living in indigenous communities. Working with indigenous partners, these investments would make significant strides in closing gaps between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples; support healthy, safe and prosperous indigenous communities; and advance meaningful reconciliation with first nations, Inuit and the Métis nation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650144">The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating for Canada’s seniors. Many have spent the past 13 months isolated from family and friends. For far too many seniors who live in long-term care, this year has been tragic: They have been the overwhelming casualties of the pandemic. Budget 2021 proposes to provide $3 billion over five years to Health Canada to support provinces and territories in ensuring standards for long-term care are applied and permanent changes are made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650145">To keep seniors safe and improve their quality of life, the federal government will work collaboratively with provinces and territories, while respecting their jurisdiction over health care, including long-term care. This work will ensure seniors and those in care live in safe and dignified conditions. The budget also proposes to increase old age security by 10% for seniors 75 and over, beginning in 2022. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650146">Budget 2021 builds on Canada’s investments in youth, with over $5.7 billion over five years to help young Canadians pursue and complete their education, to provide additional relief from student loan debt for young graduates, and to create 215,000 new job skills development and work opportunities. To ensure youth and students can access valuable job skills and experience, budget 2021 is proposing to invest $721 million in the next two years to help connect them with employers and provide them with quality job opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650147">This budget mentions Black Canadians an unprecedented 122 times. I heard from individuals in my riding like Colin Lynch and Evangeline Chima about the need for investments in Black communities and businesses. The budget proposes $200 million to endow a philanthropic fund dedicated to supporting Black-led charities and organizations serving youth and social initiatives, as well as $100 million for the supporting Black Canadian communities initiative. It also proposes to invest an additional $51 million for the Black entrepreneurship program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650148"> Budget 2021 takes on reasonable and sustainable debt. Not only can we afford these investments, it would be short-sighted of us not to make them. There is so much in this budget: a national autism strategy, funding to support our efforts to tackle climate change and so much more. Budget 2021 will continue to support Canadians, help Canada to build back better and grow our economy safely for years to come. </ParaText>

Canada, sadly, as we see the death toll climb, has not been putting into place the measures that are so essential to ensure that we try to avoid as many deaths as possible during this appalling pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650171">The question around the budget really is what does the budget do to match the size and scope of the pandemic, a crisis that we have not seen in scale, size and scope since the Second World War? How does the budget put in place the important provisions for building as Canadians, hopefully in the coming months and years, will come out of this pandemic?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650172">The instruction of the Spanish flu pandemic is something that we must all heed. The Spanish Flu pandemic, which lasted well over a year and a half, had financial and economic ramifications that took over a decade to attenuate. When we are talking about COVID-19, we are talking about measures that not only must work in the coming months as we struggle with this third wave, as frontline workers struggle with this third wave, as health care workers and first responders with all their bravery and courage, often unvaccinated, struggle to save as many lives as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650173">As we go through this, we also need to underscore the importance of having policies in place that are sustainable in the coming years to provide supports for Canadians. Sadly, this budget does not do that. It is tragic to us. The member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, the NDP leader, and members of the NDP caucus repeatedly raised a clear direction that would have made a huge difference in terms of putting into place that infrastructure, that ability to invest to help Canadians both through this pandemic and afterward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650174">We talked about a wealth tax. We talked about putting in place a pandemic profits tax, in the same way that during the Second World War we were all in this together and there was an excess profits tax that assured not only the battle to be won against fascism and Nazism, but also the rebuilding afterward; the hundreds of thousands of housing units, hospitals; education and transportation, all built because we had put into place measures that meant that we were all in this together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650175"> Sadly, this budget fails miserably in this regard. There is no wealth tax. There is no pandemic profits tax. There are no meaningful measures that actually combat the offshore tax havens that suck $25 billion every year out of our country, $25 billion that could be put into place for housing, vaccination, education, improving our health care sector and ensuring that all Canadians across the country have the wherewithal to go through the pandemic. The government chose not to put in place any of those measures, despite the fact that the revenue that is lost or the revenue that is taken overseas is substantial. What we see in this budget is a free ride given to the ultrarich in this country. What about the COVID measures?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650176">Sadly, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government seem to be saying “Mission accomplished,” when we know that this is far from the case, as this third wave crashes on our shores, as we see ICUs and emergency wards filled with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650177"> Instead of putting into place measures that will continue to extend throughout the summer, in a few weeks' time the government will start slashing emergency response benefits and supports that were given to small businesses. The government will say that it put in place a measure for all those large businesses, which used the wage subsidy for dividend payments, for executive bonuses and stock buybacks. It will close that barn door in July, but it will not ask for any repayment. However, if they use the wage subsidy in the final waning weeks of when it is available, then there may be consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650178">At a time when so many Canadians are struggling, this is absolutely unacceptable that we are wrapping up all the programs, starting in weeks, that would serve to provide support as the third wave hits our shores.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650179">There is nothing in the budget that addresses what people with disabilities across the length and breadth of the country have been facing for well over a year now. The NDP fought, and we fought vigorously, half a dozen times to push the government to finally implement a partial payment to some people with disabilities. Of the many struggles that the NDP caucus has undertaken over the course of the past year, it was probably the one where the government was most resistant, most refusing to provide support to people with disabilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650180">We know that within days of the pandemic hitting, the Liberal government was willing to basically unleash cash, $750 billion given to Canada's big banks, and liquidity supports within days. Contrast that $750 billion, an unprecedented amount that pales other supports ever handed to the banking sector and pales in comparison to what we have seen from the government in this pandemic, to people with disabilities who have struggled for a one-time $600 payment that only went to some people with disabilities, by no means all. Then we are being told in the budget that the government is going to study the question in the next three years. Maybe, eventually, there will be some supports given to Canadians with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650181">The NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> brought forward a guaranteed livable basic income proposal that the Liberals voted against. Now the Liberals are saying to Canadians with disabilities, who compose half of the people who are lining up at food banks to make ends meet, and the growing number of homeless in our country that they have to wait three years and maybe they will do something for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650182">Students are being forced to pay back student loans, while the banks get $750 billion in liquidity supports. The homeless are being offered a scant number of housing units, yet we know, from the Second World War and the instruction of having in place measures that made sure we were all in this together, that the federal government was capable of building 300,000 units of affordable housing within three years of the conclusion of World War II. In this budget, there is scant provision for the homeless in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650183">There is also the pharmacare program. At a time when 10 million Canadians have no wherewithal to pay for their medication, at a time when health care should be top of mind, the Liberals killed the Canada pharmacare bill. They have abandoned any commitment to putting in place public universal pharmacare with this budget.</ParaText>

I wrote it down because I thought it was odd to hear him say that Canada sadly did not put in place measures to reduce the death rate. Canada's death rate is the second lowest in the G7. We put in place incredible measures back at the beginning of this to encourage people to stay home. We drove up the unemployment rate, to the criticism of the Conservatives, because we wanted to keep people at home and we helped them do that through the CERB and other programs like that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6650199">Madam Speaker, the people of London have gotten a bad deal through years of Liberal and Conservative governments. Well before the pandemic, many neighbourhoods in London—Fanshawe were left behind by government policies. We would hear about rising GDP and economic prosperity, but many in my community did not see that directly. That is only because the ultra-wealthy, the 1% of Canada, do not live on Hamilton or Southdale Roads, Dundas Street or Jalna Boulevard. Many in my community have been directly impacted, of course, by COVID-19, and the people I have spoken with in London—Fanshawe are worried that they will again be left behind in the recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650200">During the pandemic, the Liberal government offered Canadians the least help possible. The NDP had to force it to do better. This budget is no different. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has chosen to continue to give his rich friends a free ride. He has chosen to continue to fail young people who are facing crushing debt. He has chosen to continue to protect the profits of big pharmaceutical companies and for-profit, long-term care providers, and he has not addressed the housing crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650201">My constituency office staff and I have tried every day to do our best to help the thousands of people who have reached out for help. The challenges and supports offered by the government are inconsistent for different people and are consistently being scaled back. This budget will leave many more still struggling, struggling with rising bills and how unaffordable everything has become, and that includes housing and drug coverage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650202">For two decades, Canadians struggling with the cost of medication have been promised a pharmacare program. Instead of taking bold action, the Liberals keep breaking their promises and making people wait. Millions of Canadians are without affordable prescription drug coverage. Even more people have lost their jobs and benefits because of COVID-19, including tens of thousands of people in London. At a time when the need is so great, it is inexcusable that the Liberals refuse to give Canadians the affordable, life-saving medicines they so desperately need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650203"> The New Democrats have repeatedly asked the federal government to establish a public drug manufacturer in Canada to address the vaccine shortage, but the Liberals continue to put the interests of multinational pharmaceutical companies and foreign governments ahead of the health of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650204">As a third wave of the pandemic rages on, Canadians, including Londoners, are depending on public health care as never before. COVID-19 case counts approach record highs in the London-Middlesex region, with ICUs now setting record case counts. COVID-19 has revealed serious gaps and long-standing problems in our health care system that budget 2021 does not address. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650205">Following the budget, I have heard about the unfair treatment from people living on fixed incomes, specifically seniors and people living with disabilities in my riding. They, too, have been hit by this pandemic financially. They have seen a rise in the cost of prescriptions, food, food delivery and housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650206"> This summer, seniors received an addition $1.50 as a result of indexing; wow. Now only those over the age of 75 will get a one-time payment of $500 and small increases thereafter. I have constituents aged 65 to 74 telling me that they do not feel the government cares about them, that they do not matter. That is tragic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650207">People living with disabilities also got nothing. During the debate on Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document>, people living with disabilities made it very clear that they were on the brink. They have been ignored for too long, pushed to extreme poverty and disparity and without the choices that others have. Instead of direct assistance, they will also get a task force. Again, my constituents have told me that they cannot pay their bills or buy food with a task force. They cannot afford skyrocketing rent with a task force. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650208">As the NDP's critic for women and gender equality, like so many of my colleagues have, I want to acknowledge that this is the first federal budget presented by a woman. This is an excellent step, there is no doubt, and it is about time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650209">What is also about time is the delivery of a universal, affordable, early-learning and child care system. Of course, after having sat on the Standing Committee for the Status Women and hearing 99% of the witnesses from all different sectors talk about the need for child care; after repeatedly hearing the statistics that women had been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, not being able to return to work in staggering numbers because they could not access safe and affordable child care; and after being a member of a political party who has fought for child care for longer than the Liberals have promised to create it, I was pleased to hear the minister's plans to create that national system. Of course, fool me once, shame on you, fool me for 28 years, that is another story. Suffice it to say that I will watch, with scrutiny, what is presented on child care from this government. However, I am more than willing to work with the government to ensure that the wait it over. We must create that universal and affordable system. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650210">I will insist that this system be publicly funded. I also sincerely hope that child care will not share the same fate as electoral reform or pharmacare. We have too often heard promises of task forces, committees or focus groups, or whatever the Liberal term of the day is, and there is an election with more promises. Then there is a new government that will come forward with a new mandate that cannot possibly move ahead with child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650211">As a New Democrat, I come to this place with a lot of hope, but as a Canadian woman I have watched for decades and seen the Liberals' shell game in action. If there is a way to make child care a reality, let us work together and get it done because it is about time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650212">Child care is not the only thing women need to help them recover from the pandemic, so I was happy to see the recognition and funding for gender-based violence organizations. However, again, despite the evidence showing how vital core operational-based funding is, the government has still only provided two years of funding to these organizations and only five years of funding to a secretariat for the national action plan to end gender-based violence and to crisis hotlines for gender-based violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650213">I will also note that the <Affiliation DbId="245230" Type="4">Minister for Women and Gender Equality</Affiliation> still has not come forward with an actual national action plan to end gender-based violence. I think that is a bit odd, but it has only been six years. It has not been 28, so I suppose women will continue to wait.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650214">Another group I consistently hear from is young people, who have been among the hardest hit by COVID. They had to make fundamental shifts in their education, employment and financial situations. However, instead of helping young people during the first wave of the pandemic, the government rushed to give almost $1 billion to its well connected friends at WE, and the money still has not made it to students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650215">Despite the second and third waves, the government will not extend the Canada emergency student benefit. During their studies, students are the ones working in the restaurants and the service sector. They hold retail jobs too. However, these businesses are still closed, and because of the poor vaccine rollout, they are unable to open. Students were also unable to collect the hours, although reduced by the government, required to obtain supports like the recovery benefit. This budget could have taken a New Democratic lead, and we could have put forward a very bold plan to ensure that students thrive instead of being buried in debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650216">We believe the federal government must work with the provinces and territories to create tuition-free post-secondary education. We want to ensure that the federal government stops profiting from student debt, by permanently removing interest on all federal student loans and by giving new graduates a five-year head start without having to repay any federal student loans. Let us let them get ahead in their careers by cancelling up to $20,000 per student of federal student loan debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650217">These are the ways that a federal government can show leadership. They are tangible ways to invest in people, who then invest in the long-term viability of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650218">There is so much more to say about housing, the environment and the end of the recovery benefit, but I know that I am at the end of my time, so I will conclude with this. Governing is about choices. This budget was about choices, and the government has made some choices that only help some people. However, it is not too late. The choices that bring people together and raise up all people equally are the choices we must make now and together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650225">Madam Speaker, a universal child care program, when it is truly affordable and provided publicly, can provide those choices to parents, no matter their position. Those parents who have the option of going the private route have always had that option. We need to ensure that the people and those parents who cannot afford the ridiculously high skyrocketing prices of child care have access, so that there is universal access. This will be by ensuring that it is publicly funded and that money does not just funnel into a very specific profitable group of people like it continually does, because of Liberal and Conservative choices. That is where I have problems, but providing parents choices and that affordability is key, and it is the government that needs to play a key role in the leadership to do that.</ParaText>

Most of the time, our two parties should be on the same side because we share many of the same values with only the centralization of power in Ottawa being problematic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650228">The Prime Minister said that the transfers would have “almost” no conditions, which scares us. The national child care program is modelled after Quebec's program, which we are very proud of because it changed many people's lives, including many women's lives, which is important. Will the member pledge to have her party support Quebec unconditionally receiving its fair share of the transfers under this national program as requested by the Bloc Québécois? Does the member pledge to support our request?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650230">Madam Speaker, I am happy to be speaking today, and I would like to inform members that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252679" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Louis</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650231">At the beginning of this crisis, the government took swift action to protect people from a devastating illness. The government members knew their efforts would need to protect not only their physical health, but their economic health. They said it best: “No Canadian should have to choose between protecting their health, putting food on the table, paying for their medication or caring for a family member.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650232">In the last 13 months, as residents of Orléans have faced an unmatched crisis, I have heard heartbreaking stories of people who have had to make enormous sacrifices to get through this, including some who have lost loved ones. I have admired the resilience of the essential workers, whether they are retail workers, medical professionals, teachers, or beyond, who have had to face every day with bravery, not knowing what risks they may encounter; the business owners who have wondered when they will be able to make a profit again; the students who face rotating waves of in-person and at-home learning; and the parents who often have had to become teachers. Many seniors have gone through a lonely year of only seeing family through a window. All of them worry about what comes next after the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650233">That is why I stand here today in favour of budget 2021. When the first female <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the member for University—Rosedale, presented her budget on April 19, she shattered barriers, but she also presented a credible plan for growth and a vision for the future of the Canadian economy that is built from the ground up. I wanted to highlight some of the initiatives that have stood out to my residents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650234">As a former businesswoman who ran my own business, I can tell you that the many meetings and discussions I have had with business owners in Orléans struck a nerve. I know what it means to take the risk and juggle fixed costs such as rent and salaries while trying to grow a business. Today, I can only admire the strength and tenacity of businesspeople who are doing this under the worst conditions possible.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6650235">Business owners have said to me, loud and clear, that budget 2021's proposed extension to the Canada emergency wage subsidy and the Canada emergency rent subsidy is essential to getting them through to the end of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650236"> The Canada emergency wage subsidy has allowed them to hold on to the workforce and talent that allowed them to flourish before 2020. They knew they had to do right by their workers, and with Canada's help many were able to do so when they otherwise might have failed. So many of our small businesses, the core of communities like Orléans, continue to keep their workers employed as they endure a rotation of lockdowns that keep customers away from their doors and demand low. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650237">Meanwhile, the Canada emergency rent subsidy has kept our bricks and mortar businesses in place. This means a start-up restaurant can continue to offer delivery, an independent florist can offer curbside pickup or a gym will be able to resume from where it left off as soon as public health measures relax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650238">With the help of these subsidies, businesses have more freedom to make the moves they need to adjust to health measures and endure lockdowns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650239">There has rarely been a darker time to run many businesses than right now, but budget 2021 is investing in a brighter future. The Canada recovery hiring program only furthers these efforts. Aimed at helping the businesses that continue to see a decline in revenue, the CRHP encourages them to invest in their workforce and bounce back strong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650240">The budget also proposes major investments, $1.4 billion in skills training and digital adoption technology. It will allow Canadian private corporations to immediately expense up to $1.5 million of eligible capital investments made between April 19 of this year and 2024. The government is priming Canadian businesses to adjust for the future and it gives them the tools they need to fuel growth. By supporting this budget, we are assuring the very people who keep our economy moving that we have their backs and that we believe in what they do for our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650241">My constituents also make it clear time and time again that the environment and a transition to a green economy is a top priority for Orléans. Canadians are concerned for the future of our planet. They worry about the impacts of climate change and how they will affect life for their children and grandchildren. The Orléans Youth Council, who I meet with every month alongside my provincial and municipal counterparts, echoes this. They will inherit whatever we leave behind today and they cannot wait for their generation to be in power before action is taken. We need to move now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650242">The government’s plan for a green recovery is the kind of action they can believe in. Budget 2021 proposes investing $5 billion over seven years in Canada’s net-zero accelerator to help to decarbonize large emitters. It proposes investing $319 million in the research and development of carbon capture technology and a tax credit to incentivize capital investment in carbon capture projects. It proposes slashing tax rates in half for businesses that manufacture zero-emission technologies, making green jobs and new technology a central focus for our economic recovery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650243">As someone who saw the devastating impact of flooding in my community in 2017 and 2019, I am relieved to see the budget propose $63.8 million over three years to create updated flood maps for high-risk areas. However, for so many of our homeowners, environment and climate change has also become an everyday pocketbook issue. That is why I am pleased to see that budget 2021 wants to give homeowners interest-free loans of up to $40,000 so they can make energy-efficient home improvements. By replacing old heating systems, drafty windows and doors or inefficient insulation, these loans give residents the power to make an investment in their own property that pays off in reduced costs every month. It addresses a long-overlooked impact of emissions on everyday Canadians, even those who may not yet feel the impact of a climate emergency still bear the burden through their monthly bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650244">Interest-free loans for retrofits will provide much-needed relief. Since budget day, my team has already received several inquiries from enthusiastic residents about this incredible incentive. The greatest relief would come from one very important program: the government’s plan to establish a Canada-wide early learning and child care system. For years, this has been raised with me as a top priority among parents, grandparents, educators and anyone with a stake in the well-being of our children. The budget’s plan to provide $10-a-day child care by 2026 would give more parents the flexibility they need to participate in the workforce and massively reduce one of the largest costs that families incur. </ParaText>

I take pride in being able to show them a budget that takes their needs seriously and believes that the government has a stake in ensuring their growth. It is presenting serious investments in small businesses, the green economy and day care, but also in students, housing for veterans, racialized communities, official languages and biomanufacturing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650266">Madam Speaker, I have been listening to the official opposition on the budget for the last few days, and it is difficult to ascertain, at least for me, if they are Keynesians or proponents of Reaganomics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650267"> They say that they support the emergency measures our government quickly put in place when the pandemic broke, programs that helped so many Canadians, families and businesses, but at the same time they decry the deficit while saying they would not eliminate it, nor do they specify what kind of deficit they could live with and for how long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650268"> International experts are urging governments around the world to stay the course, to maintain the stimulus, urging all governments to learn from the 2008 financial crisis. As we know, governments put the brakes on too soon back then and it took about 10 years for economies to recover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650269"> The government’s economic plan is working. The Bank of Canada predicts our economy will grow by 6.5% this year, an upward revision of its forecast of 4% back in January. What is more, the bank’s optimism outstrips the government’s, which expects the economy to grow by 5.8% in 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650270"> We hear a great deal from the opposition about how the government's stimulus, which obviously is contributing to the debt, is hurting future generations. However, let us not forget that a deep recession hobbles the career prospects of those about to enter the job market, not to mention of those already in the job market who have lost their jobs. This career drag can last a lifetime, and when a career gets off to a slow start, this could delay people starting a family. It could also mean lower lifetime contributions to an RRSP, which then translates into a lower future retirement income stream.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650271"> Our government is investing in the future at a time when interest rates are low. These investments, including in early learning and child care, will make Canada more productive, more competitive internationally and more prosperous. I will come back to child care in a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650272"> The returns from investing in the future will be high, and what better time to invest in high future returns than when the cost of capital is low? That is business 101. Incidentally, we can also expect a better quality of life because, in addition to child care, the government is also investing in the green economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650273"> I would like to take a moment to bring some perspective to the deficit and debt. At the end of World War II, which preceded a period of great technological innovation and historic economic expansion, the deficit-to-GDP ratio was 21%. For 2020-21, the deficit will be $346 billion or 16.1% of GDP. This is below what was predicted by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who forecast a deficit of $382.6 billion, and below what the government itself predicted in the fall economic statement, namely a deficit of $381.6 billion or 17.5% of GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650274"> The difference between today’s deficit and the one the Conservatives left us in 1993-94 is that today’s is not structural. In other words, it is not based on long-term commitments that are politically difficult to reverse. Unlike the 1993-94 deficit, today’s will begin to fade quickly. The deficit will drop in 2021-22, to 6.4% of GDP, and then to 2.3% of GDP in 2022-23. What this means is that in 2022-23, the deficit-to-GDP ratio will be one-third of what it was at the end of the Mulroney government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650275"> Some perspective is in order on the debt as well. At the end of World War II, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 100%. The debt-to-GDP ratio in 1993-94 was 71.9%. By contrast, the debt-to-GDP ratio for 2020-21 will be 49%, rising to 51.2% next year, and then declining as the economy grows and the pandemic eases. It is worth noting that Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. This includes combined net debt of all three levels of government: federal, provincial and municipal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650276"> Now, let us turn to inflation. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> spoke a great deal about monetary policy and inflation in his budget day speech. First, let us be clear, the government does not control monetary policy. Everyone knows that. Those who suggest that quantitative easing is Liberal government policy are being disingenuous, and it is disingenuous bordering on fearmongering to suggest that the Bank of Canada’s quantitative easing will bring Canada to the brink of German 1930s-style hyperinflation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650277">The budget forecasts inflation of 2.2% in 2021, 2% in 2022 and 2.1% in 2023, which is closer to a risk of deflation, I would think. The Bank of Canada, for its part, predicts inflation will ease back to 2% over the second half of 2021 and remain there on a sustained basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650278">The risk of inflation is low because the money supply does not work the same way as it did in the past. The Conservatives have not caught up with that fact. Today, for example, quantitative easing involves encouraging banks to extend credit, which increases capacity and supply, and that works against inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650279">Judging from what members of the official opposition are saying, the Bank of Canada should have kept money tight, yet at the same time they agree that deficits were needed to support Canadians in a time of crisis, so what would a combination of emergency deficits and tight money look like?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650280"> Well, it would look a lot like the 1980s, a lot like the era of Reaganomics: namely, deficits with skyrocketing interest rates. What would that have done to Canadians struggling through the worst of the pandemic, lining up at their financial institutions for mortgage relief and loan extensions for their businesses? It would have meant disaster. Unfortunately, that appears to be the economic prescription of the party opposite: Reaganomics 101, to the detriment of the middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650281">I would like to turn to productivity growth and international competitiveness. Namely, I would like to turn to child care. Over the last 40 years, the rising number of women in the workforce has accounted for about a third of Canada’s real GDP per capita growth. Experts agree that our prosperity will depend on greater equality between women and men. RBC Economics has estimated that adding more women to the workforce could boost Canada’s GDP by as much as 4% and even offset expected economic declines associated with an aging population. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650282">Any measure that would help increase women’s participation in the workforce would have a beneficial effect on the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650283">Canada’s strength and beauty lie in its federative structure. It creates a sort of laboratory where each province can implement programs that take its regional values and priorities into account, often with the federal government’s support. If one province has a good idea, the others can follow suit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650284">Quebec’s child care program is a good example of this type of cross-pollination, if you will. For many years, it was thought that the $7-a-day child care program was a luxury paid for through equalization payments. Thanks to an analysis performed in 2013 by renowned Quebec economist Pierre Fortin, in collaboration with Luc Godbout and Suzie St-Cerny, we now know that this is not true. I will quickly summarize the findings of the analysis, which confirms the merits of the Quebec experience that inspired the proposals in the recent budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650285">According to Professor Fortin, the $7-a-day child care program allowed Quebec to increase the participation of women in workforce. In 1996, before the program was implemented, women's participation rate was 2.5% lower than the Canadian average. Fifteen years later, it was 2.5% higher. Professor Fortin’s analysis estimated that, in 2008, approximately 70,000 working mothers were able to work specifically because of the $7-a-day child care program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650286">It is also estimated that this influx of women into the workforce resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 billion in Quebec’s GDP that same year. Overall, the program had a positive effect that led to a $919-million budget surplus in 2008 for the Quebec and federal governments, thanks to an increase in individual and corporate income tax, as well as a reduction in government transfer payments in the form of tax credits and deductions for child care expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650287">In short, both the economy and taxpayers will benefit from a child care program based on the Quebec model. This is a progressive budget in terms of social justice that will also benefit Canada’s economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650306">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252800" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650307">I am honoured and pleased to rise today, albeit virtually, on behalf of the good people of Simcoe—Grey to share their concerns about this budget. I have to say that after waiting two years, there were great expectations for what it would perhaps contain, but I am sad to report that the budget has not been received very positively here in my riding. It is unbelievable how lukewarm the response to this budget has been so far. Of every person I have talked to, every person who has called my office and every person who has emailed me, not one has given glowing reviews so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650308">Some are relieved that some of the COVID support programs are being continued, but residents of Simcoe—Grey would have preferred to see a plan to reopen our country. However, this would mean that the government has a plan for rapid testing and increased vaccine procurement. We know that, unfortunately, this is not the case, so we have to make do with the existing programs that support lockdowns and not having a plan to reopen our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650309">In addition to being underwhelming, this budget contains some real problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650310">Let us start with a very important issue for many here in Simcoe—Grey: support for our seniors, a group that has faced huge challenges during this pandemic. A 10% increase in OAS is something, at least. It is about $62 a month. A $500 one-time payment is certainly better than nothing. It is more than the current Liberal government provided seniors all this past year, but it is certainly less than what the House of Commons called for on March 8, when it passed the member for <Affiliation DbId="253053" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>'s motion calling on the government to increase OAS for every senior by $100 per month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650311">When the <Affiliation DbId="253377" Type="4">Minister of Seniors</Affiliation> voted against that motion, I honestly had hopes that the government was planning a bigger increase. Like the seniors in Simcoe—Grey, I was disappointed to learn this was not in the government's plan, but I was astonished to learn that the government's mediocre plan does not even include all seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650312">Everyone knows by now that the Liberal government is making the wedging of provinces against each other a priority. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> spent much of the last campaign, un-prime ministerially, slagging Ontario and Alberta to desperately gain votes. Who would have thought he would stoop so low as to wedge seniors against one another? The Liberals have created two tiers of seniors in this country: seniors who get the additional 10% OAS support and the $500, and those who do not. In effect, we have created two classes, junior seniors and senior seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650313"> Marlee Workman from Wasaga Beach felt so betrayed by the current government, she told me she thinks the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s plan for seniors is to hope that the vaccine failures ensure that no seniors will hit the age of 75. Imagine feeling that betrayed by one's own government. It is rare to hear seniors hope to get older, but that seems to be their only hope to get help from the current Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650314">My constituent Lloyd Lancaster told me about his friend who called him the other day, all excited to tell him that the government was finally doing something for seniors. Lloyd said, “Read the fine print.” After reading it, he certainly was not very excited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650315">Another constituent, Annette MacDonald, told me she voted twice for this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but then shared with me a copy of a letter she wrote to him after reading the budget: “To add insult to injury, your new Budget contains nothing for me. Somehow seniors aged 65-74 are not considered seniors anymore! This is the final insult!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650316"> It is just so puzzling to make this distinction. Why create two tiers of seniors? I wonder whether the <Affiliation DbId="253377" Type="4">Minister of Seniors</Affiliation> even speaks up at the cabinet table, because the Liberals seem to have money for everyone and every group—in fact, the Liberals even announced $1.4 billion in new funding for developing countries—but they cannot spare a penny for those aged 65 to 74 here in Canada. The budget even explicitly states on page 114, “We owe our elders a great debt.” I must have missed the asterisk that says it is only applicable to those 75 and over. The legacy of this minister will be of one who created Canada's two-tier system for seniors, and that should not be anyone's legacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650317">What about farmers, the ones who feed us? Farmers in Simcoe—Grey were looking forward to this budget for a long time, but they are disappointed too. There is no exemption on the punitive carbon tax, which so many of them were calling for. Many local farmers have called my office frustrated with the Liberal carbon tax. I had a farmer tell me that the rebate is an absolute joke and it does not even come close to covering the additional cost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650318">Because the Liberals want to charge farmers more to produce our food, the average farmer is left with two choices. First, they can eat the thousands of dollars in additional costs, which means less money for their families, less money going to RESPs for their kids, or having to work a few extra years before retirement, and that is not fair.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650319">The other option is to pass these costs along to Canadians. This is the option that most farmers will be forced to choose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650320">We know the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will not care about a few extra bucks here and there, but do members know who will end up feeling the pinch? It will be the average working families living in the suburbs and our small towns. They cannot leave their condo to stroll to the market, nor can they take a subway to work. Their carbon rebate does not cover what they pay already, and when the increased cost of food is factored in, they will be further alienated from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650321">We need to ensure that our Canadian farmers will continue to be prosperous and ensure that their children, and the next generations, will be able to follow in their footsteps and continue to make sure that we have food security here in Canada. This budget does not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650322">What about small businesses? Small businesses across my riding have been struggling for over a year now. While many were able to get assistance, it took months of pressure from this side of the House and from Canadians from coast to coast to coast to force the government to make programs easier to access and available to most. Even now, there are many small business owners who still cannot get assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650323">The government's failure to procure vaccines means that these lockdowns need to continue across Canada. Our businesses are forced to stay closed while those around the world begin to reopen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650324">My constituent Laura-Lee Gambee of Mountain Men's Barbershop in Collingwood had saved her money, signed her lease in February 2020 and opened in August. She has had to temporarily close a number of times since then, and if members can believe it, she is not eligible for any supports. I have raised this problem, which she and others like her are facing, regularly in the House of Commons. My colleagues have all done the same. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650325">I, along with Laura-Lee and others, had hoped that the government would correct this glaring flaw in this budget, but the government has failed her and others like her. “I feel abandoned by my own government”, she told me. “What do we have to do to get help?” It is not fair that new businesses are not eligible for any supports, and quite frankly, the government should not be picking which businesses will succeed or fail based on the date they opened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650326">While COVID has put a hit on businesses across <Affiliation DbId="252838" Type="2">Simcoe—Grey</Affiliation>, it is not like this was a pro-small business government before this pandemic hit. We all know this government thinks that small business owners are tax cheats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650327">We know we need to reduce taxes for small businesses. Businesses that will be lucky enough to reopen when Canada finally gets back to normal will have missed over a year of regular sales. A targeted reduction on taxes for small businesses would have been a boost to the bottom line and an expression of confidence that things will be getting back to normal soon, but the government gave small business owners neither. They gave them no tax reductions, and they have given them no confidence that businesses will be back to normal any time soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650328"> Mike and Terri Jerry own two small clothing stores in my riding. Mike told me that while they have been able to squeak by with limited openings and the Liberal government assistance, getting their sales back to normal will take time. He was hoping for targeted tax relief. He told me that every 1% or 2% makes a huge difference, and that it all adds up. It sure would have been welcomed after the year that they have had. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650329">What worries most of my constituents is what will happen to the tax levels if the Liberals win a majority government. There are no increases in taxation in this budget per se, as the Liberals would not put a tax increase in a budget that they want to campaign on, but despite what members have heard, we all know that budgets do not balance themselves. While the Liberals made promises that taxes are not going up, can we really believe that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650330">Carbon taxes were not going up either. Do members remember that? It is terrifying to think what the government would do if it had a majority government. With every, man, woman and child in this country now owing $33,000 in federal debt, how long will it be before the Liberal tax collector comes calling? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650331">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to say that he took on debt for Canada so that families did not have to, but servicing the debt surely will not be coming out of his trust fund. It will be coming out of our pockets, our kids' pockets and their kids' pockets. That is how bad our debt is now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650332">No one begrudges the spending made to fight COVID and to provide supports, but the Liberals foolishly ran billions of dollars in deficits before COVID, so when COVID came, we were ill prepared as a country. Now we are worse off with absolutely no plan at all to return to balanced budgets or to get the economy back on track. Supporting Canadians is essential, but if the government had its act together, we would be getting back to work, not in our latest and, so far, worst lockdown.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650354">Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague on being the first female Canadian <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> to introduce a budget in the House of Commons. Though we are on opposite sides of the House, it is phenomenal. I do want to acknowledge that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650355">Although I am glad the government finally decided to introduce a budget after more than two years, it must be pointed out that we are the only country in the G7 that went this long without one. Despite the unprecedented amount of government spending that has taken place, it is only now that we are being presented with a spending plan. This, I believe, is absolutely unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650356">It certainly does not speak of a government that is striving for openness, transparency and accountability, as it often advertises. I recognize there has been a pandemic, but nearly every other government in the country, whether provincial and municipal, has put forward a budget during this time. If they were able to do so, then surely the Liberal government was also able to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650357">Before the budget was tabled, constituents shared with me that they were hoping to see a real plan for economic recovery and for reopening society as we know it. They were hoping for a restoration of hope and confidence in our future. Those who are unemployed shared with me that they were hoping to see a plan to create new jobs and economic opportunities for their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650358">Those in the oil and gas sector shared with me that they were hoping to see some support for this world-class industry. Those who own local businesses and create jobs were hoping they would no longer have to be on the verge of permanently closing their doors. They were hoping that proper supports would be offered to them and that we would go back to normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650359">Sadly, what the Liberal government delivered was a 700-page budget that will increase Canada's debt load by $1.3 trillion by 2022 and includes very little for those who call Alberta home. This is not stimulus spending focused on creating jobs, but rather spending on Liberal partisan priorities. Although there are some necessary support measures contained in this budget for Canadians who are still getting through the economic challenges due to the pandemic, it goes well beyond what is necessary. This is like the government going to Gucci when it really should be going to Walmart. It is not going with its own credit card. It is going with ours, the Canadian people. This is the deal: The government racks up the debt, and Canadians foot the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650360">A strategic budget would have targeted revenue-generating industries in our country so that one dollar would turn into three dollars. Instead, we see massive amounts of cash being flushed through the country in a manner that benefits the current government's partisan interests, rather than the well-being of Canadians as a whole. The budget will extend the pandemic economic recession longer than necessary due to its exorbitant spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650361">Canada is in a rough situation right now. People are hurting emotionally, psychologically, economically and physically. That must be acknowledged. Canadians are looking for a way out, a change, not more of the same. Sadly, that is what this budget is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650362">It is a perpetuation of our current fiscal state where unemployment rates are high, government handouts are a primary source of income and the human spirit is severely damaged. It is a superficial solution that does not fix the real problem of a struggling economy and a struggling people. This was an opportunity for the government to chart a course toward a return to pre-COVID times. Of course, I would propose 2014 to take that opportunity, but that said, I would take 2019 at this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650363">Instead, we see a Liberal government that is extending the pandemic economic recovery efforts with this budget. This will put us at a serious competitive disadvantage globally, especially when we see other countries returning to normal. Their economic engines are running again and ours is being flooded with no hope of a jump start. It is hard not to be envious of countries such as the United States, where concerts are taking place on Fridays, sports stadiums are full on Saturdays and churches are bustling with life on Sundays. In Taiwan, life is basically back to normal and has been for a long time due to its rapid response to the virus. It had a total of 1,100 cases and only 12 deaths. That is amazing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650364">The current government seems to wear federal debt as a badge of honour. It is bizarre and troubling. More borrowing and spending does not equate to good governance. Under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canada has incurred the largest per capita deficit and hit the highest unemployment rate in the G7, which means Canada has spent the most to achieve the least. Money spent is not a measuring stick for success as much as the government would like to use it as such. Lowering the unemployment rate or growing our national GDP are things that are worth celebrating and using as measures of success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650365">Just a few weeks before the Liberal budget was tabled, the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “I really believe COVID has created a window of political opportunity”. This mentality is truly shocking and troublesome, but it also explains how the Liberals view this pandemic. They see it as an opportunity to re-engineer society according to their value set. It is exploitive and wrong.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6650366">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s “reimagined economy” is a risky Ottawa-knows-best approach that picks winners and losers by design. He is dictating which jobs, sectors and regions of our country will stay afloat and prosper and which will be left to perish. Never before has there been such a divisive prime minister in this nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650367">Canadians know the government has no money of its own. Anything the government spends comes from taxes and borrowing. What the government borrows, Canadians pay back through taxation. There is no such thing as a free lunch, regardless of how the government tries to package it. The thing about government spending is that it always comes back to the people at a significant cost. It is common knowledge that when taxes go up, an unfriendly or even hostile environment is created for business. High taxes result in businesses leaving the country for other jurisdictions where they are not taxed to fill government coffers. The problem with businesses leaving the country is that they take jobs with them. When they take jobs with them, they also take the revenue that the government relies on for the social safety net that Canadians enjoy so much. This results in higher unemployment and more Canadians being dependent on the government for support, as opposed to being independent and self-sufficient because they have jobs. This pattern is extremely detrimental to the Canadian people, but highly beneficial for a political party that only maintains power when Canadians are dependent on government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650368">Instead of working to get Canadians out of the dole line, it seems as though the Liberals are doing everything in their power to prolong the current situation and to capitalize on an obliged and increasingly indebted electorate. So much federal money has been spent on COVID-19 benefit programs that, on average, Canadians now have more personal income than they did pre-COVID, even though the average employment income has fallen dramatically. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650369">Let us talk about big government. This is not a budget that a responsible government would put forward: It is a budget that sets up an opportunistic Prime Minister for success in the event of an election. Notably, despite the massive debt incurred, this budget failed in a few key areas. There is no plan to fight the pandemic. This is interesting, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> touted this budget as his pandemic response. There is no new money for health care transfers, no fiscal anchor or debt-management strategy. That is atrocious for a national budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650632">The bill I am introducing today sets up a national strategy to promote efforts across Canada to conserve and improve the health of our soils. The strategy will help maintain, enhance and rebuild the capacity of soils to produce food and fuel for years to come, and it will encourage farmers and other land users with research, education, training, knowledge transfer and best practices. The bill would also recommend the establishment of a national advocate for soil health and will formally recognize both World Soil Day on December 5, and National Soil Conservation Week in the third week of April each year. </ParaText>

Bill <Document DbId="10871883" Type="3">C-6</Document> causes great concern. The term “conversion therapy” is vaguely defined in the bill. Under the bill, Canadian parents, religious leaders and teachers would be subject to prosecution under the Criminal Code. Children would be given an irresponsible amount of latitude to make major sexual and medical decisions that would have lifelong implications. The bill would discriminate against LGBTQ individuals seeking guidance and counselling toward heterosexual or cisgender behaviour, and would regulate choices that Canadian citizens should be permitted to make for themselves. Therefore, the petitioners call upon the House to protect the moral, religious, philosophical and sexual interests of the citizens of Canada by preventing the passage of this bill into law.</ParaText>

Where appropriate, the CRA works with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian anti-fraud centre, CAFC, financial institutions and local police to investigate the incident. In many cases, the CRA will also provide the taxpayer with credit protection and monitoring services.</ParaText>

As part of this approach, the government regularly seeks feedback from Canadians and various advisory panels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650687">The government reduced the rate of the second personal income tax bracket from 22% to 20.5%.  This tax cut for the middle class, which has been in effect since 2016, is benefitting more than nine million Canadians.  Single individuals who benefit are seeing an average tax reduction of $330 every year, and couples who benefit are seeing an average tax reduction of $540 every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650688">The government also introduced the Canada child benefit in 2016, which has meant more money for the families who need it most. The Canada child benefit has helped lift nearly 300,000 children out of poverty, giving them a better start in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650689">In addition, the government’s proposed increase in the basic personal amount would lower taxes for close to 20 million Canadians.  By 2023, single individuals could save close to $300 in taxes each year, while families, including those led by a single parent, could save nearly $600 in taxes each year.  Nearly 1.1 million more Canadians will no longer pay tax in 2023.

              <ParaText id="6650699">The first action of the government’s second mandate was to introduce a measure that would increase the amount of money Canadians can earn before paying federal income tax to $15,000 by 2023.

              <ParaText id="6650703">Mr. Speaker, data from the 2016 survey of financial security was used to assess how sensitive Canadian households could be to short-term income loss. While this survey was carried out a few years ago, the distribution of wealth evolves slowly over time, and as such, the survey is likely a reasonable approximation of the potential financial vulnerability of Canadian families going into the COVID-19 pandemic. The department estimated that over half of working households had insufficient liquid assets to fully replace a two-month interruption in after-tax income. As such, these households could see a significant deterioration in their living standards and would face difficulties in meeting their financial obligations or essential needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650704">Financially vulnerable households are found across the country, with the highest shares in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and the Prairies. Younger households were at higher risk of financial vulnerability: 54% of younger households are financially vulnerable to a two-month work interruption, compared to 46% of older households. In a similar analysis, using the 2016 survey of financial security, the Bank of Canada found that households in the occupations most at risk from the pandemic, e.g., sales and service, had the weakest financial positions: https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/06/staff-analytical-note-2020-8/. Similarly, based on low-income cut-off thresholds, Statistics Canada reported that one in four working households would not have enough liquid assets to keep them out of low income during a two-month work interruption: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/45-28-0001/2020001/article/00010-eng.pdf?st=DG2ZxWGC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650705">These results suggest that a sizable number of Canadian households had limited financial buffers to cope with temporary income losses during the pandemic. This finding underlines the importance of Canada’s COVID-19 economic response in targeting people who need it most and bridging Canadians through the shock: e.g., Canada emergency response benefit, Canada emergency wage subsidy and mortgage payment deferrals, among others. This support has been critical to helping minimize financial difficulties of households thus far during the pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650713">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is fully committed to delivering on its commitment to plant two billion trees over the next 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650714">Natural Resources Canada is looking to engage those interested in growing Canada’s forests as a nature-based solution to support national climate change actions. The growing Canada’s forests program has recently launched two new processes, an expression of interest and a request for information, to identify the desire and capacity of organizations to plant trees across Canada over the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650715">A future participants request for information launched recently to identify interested organizations and learn about their vision and capacity to implement or contribute to large-scale, single- or multi-year tree-planting projects across Canada. This will help to determine the design of the growing Canada’s forests program, develop future processes to maximize program participation and strengthen collaboration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650716">The growing Canada’s forests program will allocate approximately 16% of the contribution funding towards urban and peri-urban tree planting, collaborating with municipalities and organizations that can engage broad community groups: e.g., school boards, indigenous communities and others. Tree-planting opportunities include the expansion, maintenance and diversification of urban and other forests, which may also help communities to become more climate change resilient, mitigating risks such as increased forest fire danger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650717">Existing federal programs are already supporting tree planting, with approximately 150 million seedlings expected to be planted by 2022 through the low-carbon economy fund in working with provinces and territories, as well as trees planted through the disaster mitigation and adaptation fund in working with local communities. The Government of Canada also continues to support the Highway of Heroes tree campaign, which has planted more than 750,000 out of a planned two million trees in Ontario between Trenton and Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650718">As part of its commitment to supporting Canada’s forests and forest sector, the Government of Canada took early action in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing up to $30 million to support small and medium-sized forest sector firms, including tree-planting operations, and defray the costs associated with COVID-19 health and safety measures. This funding helped ensure a successful 2020 tree-planting season and the planting of an estimated 600 million trees, while protecting workers and communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650728">Mr. Speaker, Statistics Canada released the results from the 2019 Survey of Financial Security, December 22, 2020. The survey showed that almost one-third, or 30.2%, of Canadian families were debt-free in 2019, virtually unchanged from the 2016 results. For those who held debt, the median value of debt in 2019 stood at $79,000 per family which was about $6,400 less than in 2016 after adjusting for inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650729">Families overall reported holding more mortgage debt in 2019, up $7 billion from 2016. However, the median level of mortgage debt for those with mortgages fell over the same period from $201,200 to $190,000. The level of non-mortgage debt was unchanged between 2016 and 2019. The median was $20,000.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650732">Mr. Speaker, the physical and psychological health and safety of employees remain an absolute priority for the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada continues to be guided by the advice and guidance of public health authorities, including Canada’s chief public health officer, and the direction of provinces/territories and cities. While the COVID-19 pandemic presents ongoing challenges for Canadians and for the public service, the government has been moving collectively and successfully towards managing COVID-19 as part of its ongoing operations and the continued delivery of key programs and services to Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650735">The Government of Canada is committed to supporting employees, whether physically in the workplace or at home. Together and apart, the government will continue to deliver information, advice, programs and services that Canadians need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650751">Mr. Speaker, according to Labour Force Survey, LFS, estimates, in February 2021, compared with 12 months earlier, there were 406,000, or 50%, more people working fewer than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19. The LFS does not collect information on whether an individual’s earnings have changed over time. However, the following information about the number of employees in various wage brackets was reported with the release of February 2021 data from the LFS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650752">Immediately before the pandemic in February 2020, about one-quarter of all employees in Canada earned $17.50 per hour or less, while one-quarter earned more than $36 per hour. These wage brackets are helpful in understanding the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on lower-paid and higher-paid workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650753">The number of employees making $17.50 per hour or less increased by 203,000 in February. This number is not seasonally adjusted. This partly offset a decline of 321,000 in January and coincided with a February rebound in employment in the retail trade, and accommodation and food services industries, where lower wages are more prevalent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650754">There were 791,000, or 19.7%, fewer employees in this wage bracket in February 2021 than 12 months earlier. Nearly two-thirds, or 63.6%, of the losses were among women, with similar declines in all age groups. Young men were far less affected by the decline, 82,000 fewer, or 11.4%, than were young women, 178,000 fewer, or 20.9%. This number is not seasonally adjusted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650755">In contrast, there were 410,000, or 10.3%, more employees making more than $36 per hour in February compared with one year earlier. This number is not seasonally adjusted. The number of people in this highest-earning wage bracket followed an upward trend during the summer and early fall of 2020 before flattening in recent months, and was little changed in February. This is not seasonally adjusted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650775">Mr. Speaker, what follows is the response from the CRA to the above-noted question since March 1, 2020. With regard to parts (a), (b), (d), (e), (f) (i), and (g), due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several programs were temporarily suspended during the time period requested, as they were considered non-critical services. Therefore, employee workloads were shifted to reflect critical services. The CRA is unable to provide the data that is being requested, as the CRA did not create a system indicator to determine which files were put on hold due to the COVID-19 suspensions. Throughout the pandemic, the CRA has worked to design and implement COVID-19 related benefit programs. The CRA has also redeployed many auditors to assist with the verification activities associated with these new programs. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and redistribution of workloads, the CRA’s volume of files under audit is lower than expected</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650776">With regard to part (c), due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several programs were temporarily suspended as they were considered non-critical services. Employee workloads were shifted to reflect critical services, such as the COVID-19 benefit programs, COVID-19 related call centre activities and operation activities. Audit activity continued throughout the pandemic, but was limited to high-risk audits and exceptional circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650777">With regard to part (f)(ii), between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the latest data available, there were 40 referrals from all CRA audit programs to the CRA's criminal investigations program. The CRA cannot provide a breakdown of referrals from each program in the manner requested, since CRA systems do not track this level of detail. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650779">Mr. Speaker, audit data on the Canada emergency wage subsidy, CEWS, program is highly sensitive information. Providing detailed information regarding the specific number of audits planned/conducted for a given compliance program could embolden some taxpayers to cut corners and take aggressive positions in the hopes that they will avoid detection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650780">With regard to parts (a)(i) and (ii),the total number of Canada emergency wage subsidy applications that have been approved is available on the CRA website on the “Claims to date: Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy” page at www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-statistics.html/. As of March 7, 2021, 10,670 initial CEWS applications were cancelled/disallowed, i.e., denied. Of that figure, 7,020 were cancelled whereas 3,650 were disallowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650781">With regard to parts (b), (c) and (f), the CRA does not capture the number of corporate CEWS applicants that had a subsidiary or subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions of concern in the manner in which the information is requested for this benefit program. The majority of taxpayers that are likely to have a subsidiary or subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions of concern have not yet filed their current corporate income tax return and all related information returns covering the qualifying periods for which CEWS claims were made. As such, the CRA will be applying its risk assessment systems to these required tax filings, and will identify the highest risk taxpayers for its core compliance programs and for its CEWS post-payment audit program, which can include an examination of subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions of concern, depending on the compliance risks identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650782">As a general matter, the CRA does use the presence of subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions of concern as a risk factor in selecting files for audit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650783">With regard to part (d), compliance activities are still ongoing. A notice of determination will be sent to the taxpayers when, as a result of a post-payment audit, it is determined that the taxpayers’ claims should be reduced or denied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650784">With regard to part (e), as noted above, compliance activities are ongoing and it is premature to report on this, however, the total amount that has been denied through claims either fully or partially disallowed is just over $800 million as of March 22, 2021.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650786">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is fully committed to delivering on its commitment to plant two billion trees over the next 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650787">Natural Resources Canada is looking to engage those interested in growing Canada’s forests as a nature-based solution to support national climate change actions. The growing Canada’s forests program has recently launched two new processes, and expression of interest and a request for information, to identify the desire and capacity of organizations to plant trees across Canada over the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650788">A future participants request for information launched recently to identify interested organizations and learn about their vision and capacity to implement or contribute to large-scale, single or multi-year tree-planting projects across Canada. This will help to determine the design of the growing Canada’s forests program, develop future processes to maximize program participation and strengthen collaboration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650789">Existing federal programs are already supporting tree planting, with approximately 150 million seedlings expected to be planted by 2022 through the low-carbon economy fund, working with provinces and territories, as well as trees planted through the disaster mitigation and adaptation fund, working with local communities. The Government of Canada also continues to support the Highway of Heroes tree campaign, which has planted more than 750,000 out of a planned two million trees in Ontario between Trenton and Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650790">As part of its commitment to supporting Canada’s forests and forest sector, the Government of Canada took early action in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing up to $30 million to support small and medium-sized forest sector firms, including tree-planting operations, and defray the costs associated with COVID-19 health and safety measures. This funding helped ensure a successful 2020 tree-planting season and the planting of an estimated 600 million trees, while protecting workers and communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650898">Mr. Speaker, the request for an emergency debate is related to the dispute at the Port of Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650899"> Longshoremen at the Port of Montreal have been on strike since this morning. Yesterday, the government gave notice that it would be introducing special legislation before the strike had even begun. Today, the parties are having one last mediation session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650900">I am requesting an emergency debate to make sure that our government did everything it could before introducing a special bill that would put an end to negotiations and legislate working conditions for the longshoremen. I think there are other potential solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650901">The union has even pointed out many times over the past several days that it would have put an end to all of its pressure tactics had the employer withdrawn two measures that imposed new working conditions. I think solutions can be found if we want to take action. Special legislation is not a solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650902">There is a way to debate this issue in the House. We have a major responsibility to ensure that every effort will be made before special legislation is introduced. I am calling for this emergency debate because the government is supposed to introduce that legislation in the coming days, maybe even as early as tomorrow. It is therefore important to first debate in the House the steps that the government could take to guarantee the negotiation of a collective agreement and get everyone back to work. No one wants this dispute, but there are solutions. We cannot accept the introduction of special legislation as a solution because it is not a solution but a sign of failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650903">This merits an emergency debate in the House to determine how to act with equanimity on this issue. I am rising now under the provisions of Standing Order 52 because I know there is a particular time to do so. I am asking that the emergency debate be held as soon as possible because special legislation could be introduced in the very near future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650906">Measures were taken to inquire as to how the deplorable incident occurred. On Wednesday, April 21, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252602" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> stood in the House to admit that it was he who had taken the screenshot and to apologize for his action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650907"> The point of order raised by the <Affiliation DbId="253375" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> is a serious one. All members of this House should be able to rely on their colleagues and staff to respect each other in conducting themselves in the chamber, whether in person or virtually. It is in everyone's interest that this practice continues to be observed rigorously. As such, the events of that day are a clear breach of our rules and, more important, an affront to the authority and dignity of the House and its members.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6650908"> You are undoubtedly aware, and my predecessors repeated it on numerous occasions, that it is strictly forbidden for anyone, except photographers authorized by the House, to take photos during our proceedings. There is no need to remind members that the virtual nature of the proceedings of the House and its committees has brought with it many changes and required many adjustments from everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650909">However, that in no way affects the validity of the rule. Respecting the rule has never been more crucial than it is at a time when members are participating in proceedings from their office on the Hill or in their electoral district, or even from their residence. I would add that the ease with which it is possible to share and disseminate information using the tools at our disposal only increases the risk of the rule's being broken. I reminded all members of this at the beginning of the session on September 28 and 29, 2020. The staff members of each party with access to the system that facilitates the virtual deliberations were also informed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650910">So, the Chair wants to remind all members and everyone with this privileged access that screenshots, photos of a screen and visual recordings of the proceedings of the House or any of its committees, whether open to the public or not, are absolutely prohibited.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6650911">I am therefore counting on everyone's collaboration to respect the rules in the new operating environment. As far as the House is concerned and the procedural aspect of this issue, I consider the matter closed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650914">Mr. Speaker, Canada needs a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who sees where the solutions to our country's challenges truly lie. It is not in the government; it is in the people. It is Canadians who are the problem solvers, the solution makers and the wealth creators, not the government. We need a leader who sees the potential for the greatness of this nation in a free and self-sufficient people, again, not a big, bloated government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650915">I am grieved by the ongoing patronization of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and so many of his ministers when addressing Canadians as if they are weak and helpless and in need of ongoing supports and handouts from the government, as if they do not have the ability, in and of themselves, to be a creative and strong part of the solution as we move forward. If they would only see Canadian people for who they are and let them do what they are best at doing, generating solutions, solving problems, designing equipment and technology, pursuing innovation, building businesses, creating jobs and securing our future, then we would be headed down a much better path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650916">Canadians are fair, they are reasonable and they are generous. What they are looking for is a road map. They are looking, first and foremost, for an ethical and competent leader at the helm and then they are looking for a plan, one with decisive action that is outlined, that can be measured and will be followed through on. We need to unleash the power of our workforce and let the ingenuity of the people map a course forward. Canadians want a secure future. They do not want to be handcuffed by an overwhelmingly bloated government or debt load or high taxes. Canadians deserve better than what is currently on offer and they want to be a part of the solution, moving forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650938">Madam Speaker, I would like to pick up where the member was referencing leadership. It is hard not to laugh internally when I hear members say, “It's about leadership”. Let me give a good example of what leadership really is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650939">Just over five years ago when we formed the government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that the environment was an important issue for all Canadians. Back then, over five years ago, the Liberal Party of Canada said that we needed to put a price on pollution. For days, weeks, months and years we heard the Conservative party yell from their seats how terrible it was, and that it was a carbon tax. For years this went on. Now, we see that the Conservative Party has adopted the need to have a price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650940">Do not get me wrong. I am glad that the Conservatives recognized, on the road to Damascus, the need to change and better reflect what Canadians are thinking, but this is regarding leadership and that vacuum prior. Why did it take the Conservatives five years to recognize what Canadians and the government have been talking about for the last five years? That, to me, is a lack of leadership. It goes beyond the present Conservative leader to speak to the type of leadership that was there with Stephen Harper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650941">We have seen strong leadership coming from the Government of Canada working with many different stakeholders during a difficult time. It is because we have worked with Canadians, listened to what they had to say and brought in some bold initiatives over the last 12 months that Canada is well positioned to generate jobs into the future and ensure that we can provide the types of programs that Canadians have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650942">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and my colleagues often talk about building back better, and I can tell members that each and every Liberal member of Parliament is committed to building back better, because we understand—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6650945">I was talking about the strength of leadership that we saw at the national level and in provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Stakeholders came to the table with that team Canada approach and, as a result, Canada is in a much better position to build back better. I referenced the sense of commitment that I know every Liberal member of Parliament in the House of Commons has to ensure that we have a better economy and a better social environment. There are many examples of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650946">I am very proud of the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the first female national Minister of Finance, who did a fabulous job of presenting a plan that is going to take us into the years ahead. It will protect health care. We are investing in science to build domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity, something that we learned we needed. That is one aspect of building back better. We are investing $5 billion to create national standards for long-term and older adult care. We know that is a priority for Canadians. We have seen a good rationale for the arguments presented through the last 12 months. We are improving mental health services. We will continue to push for a national pharmacare program, at the same time recognizing that we need buy-in from the provinces to provide the type of pharmacare program that Canadians expect of all levels of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650947">We talk about putting people first. It is something I often reference. We see that in the budget, with an extension of income and business supports such as the CRB and the CEWS through to the fall. I find it amazing that members of the opposition criticize the government because we fulfilled a campaign promise. I am sure many of my colleagues will remember the campaign promise that if Liberals formed government, we would increase OAS for those 75 and over by 10%. That was a campaign promise. We are fulfilling that campaign promise, and the Conservatives are criticizing us for it and asking about other seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650948">In 2015 and 2016, this government lifted hundreds of thousands of seniors out of poverty. It increased the GIS for the poorest seniors in the country. In Winnipeg North alone, hundreds of seniors were lifted out of poverty because of direct action by this government. These are the types of things that are making a difference. It is a way that we are putting people first. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650949">We are giving children a head start and adding value to our economy by reducing the cost of regulated child care by 50% by 2022, with the goal of it costing $10 a day by 2026. What a bold initiative that is. We want the so-called gold standard in Quebec to be applied across Canada. Not only those who have children, but all of society will benefit from that because we will have more value in our economy as a direct result. We are investing close to $30 billion over the next five years to build that permanent national system. We are committed to working with the provinces to make that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650950">I talked about the price of pollution and the lack of leadership from the Conservative Party on that issue. Planning for a green recovery is an important aspect of the budget. We are fighting climate change with a price on pollution, helping more than 200,000 Canadians make their homes greener. </ParaText>

Building a net-zero economy by investing in world-leading technologies, not to mention the legislation we brought forward and conserving 25% of our lands and oceans by 2025 for future generations, are the types of initiatives that are going to make a difference when we talk about planning for a green recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650952">Jobs are important. Many sectors have been hit hard. Programs such as the emergency wage subsidy program, the emergency rent subsidy program, the emergency business account, the credit availability program and the relief and recovery fund, not to mention the CERB, combined with other programs during this difficult time have put Canada in an excellent position. We are on track to create a million jobs before the end of this year. We are supporting almost 500,000 new training and work opportunities. We are helping small businesses to transform for a digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650953">These are the types of initiatives that are making a difference in the lives of all Canadians. We are in this position today because we have taken seriously the priorities Canadians have had over the last 12-plus months: minimizing the negative impacts of the coronavirus and being there for Canadians during this time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650954">The Government of Canada, with the support of many, has done just that.

              <ParaText id="6650970">I am going to start with a reflection on the historical nature of this budget and with a thought that comes to us from the late Jane Jacobs, one of the most remarkable thinkers in Canada and a great urban planner. In her last book, <I>Dark Age Ahead</I>, she mentioned that we as a society seem to have collective amnesia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650971">What I am going to say next will probably result in some heckling. I apologize for that. I mean I apologize for possibly provoking heckling, not for heckling, as I have never heckled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650972">I do find it important, as we look at this budget, which has, finally, a historic commitment to child care, to look at the last chance we had for child care, the last chance we had to actually live up to our Kyoto targets and the last chance we had to make substantial progress toward reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650973">I am speaking of the 2005 achievements that were brought to an end. I am not going to refer to the political parties or the leaders at the time, but I will say that those opportunities were snatched from us by our first-past-the-post electoral system. This is why I say that, and I will just preface this by saying I was not a member of any political party at the time. I was the executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada. When I think of November 28, 2005, I could weep. I have wept. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650974">We had a really good plan to reach the Kyoto targets. When I speak of collective amnesia, this include the Liberals, whose plan it was, but who seem to have completely forgotten that this was a historic reality. We had a very detailed budget from Ralph Goodale as finance minister. The minister of environment at the time was Stéphane Dion. It was found that it would have gotten us to within striking distance of 6% below 1990 levels. We now stand, in our last reported emissions, at 21% above 1990 levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650975">Ken Dryden was the minister who delivered the child care plan, which was phenomenal. It had something that we do not have now in that it had signed agreements from 10 provinces. It really mattered. Members can ask Martha Friendly. It mattered, and it also had funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650976">We also had five major indigenous organizations in this country representing first nations, Métis, Inuit, native women and so on working on a very strong agreement, which was called the Kelowna accord, of $5 billion over five years. It was never enough, but it was a good start. These were all brought to an end because of first past the post and because of looking ahead at what would happen if a minority government was supported again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650977">Earlier in this House there was a bit of a debate between the member for <Affiliation DbId="252898" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252646" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> about the budget that year. Let us be clear. The budget that year did carry. Paul Martin's government did not fall on the budget. The budget, as some of us will remember, was brilliantly rewritten by Jack Layton. The budget included close to $5 billion in increased social spending, money for affordable housing and more money to end global poverty. It actually would have put Canada on track to hold to 0.7%, to meet that target known as the Pearson target. As I said, I could weep.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650978">The budget passed, but then the Conservatives under Stephen Harper engineered the fall of the government by putting forth their own non-confidence motion, with the support of the other two parties in this House today, the Bloc and the NDP. It brought down the government because of first past the post. This is because, if an opposition party is looking forward, it really does not want the Liberals to be all that popular, and it would be popular if it were delivering on Kyoto, delivering on Kelowna and delivering on child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650979">If it were not for that fateful vote on November 28, 2005, our emissions would now be measured against 1990 levels, not 2005 levels, and we would not be 21% above 1990 levels. We would be below them. Child care would have been a reality for Canadian working mothers and, I should say, parents, as dads take responsibility too, but as we know, it is mostly moms. Child care would have been a reality for the last 15 years, not five years away, as the new <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> states. I believe she fully intends and is fully committed to delivering on child care, but as a provincial jurisdictional reality, the money will not be enough without the agreements. We have to hope that child care deal gets done, but we would have had it for a very long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650980">Here we are with this budget, and what do we like about it? Again, I have to say that if this budget is back to the future, we will never get those years back. It was a political calculation that it was worth defeating Paul Martin's government to put Stephen Harper in place because everybody, the Bloc, the NDP and the Conservatives, would do better later on.</ParaText>

We want to see that succeed, and we would love to support that. However, this budget is missing pharmacare. Why are we not moving ahead on pharmacare? The Hoskins report is sitting there gathering dust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650983">What happened to guaranteed livable income? We heard the Liberal convention and the NDP convention both support having a basic income, and that means a guaranteed livable income. It is not here at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650984">What happened to speaking to the opioid crisis that is taking lives across this country? Where is decriminalization? Where are the really significant plans to deal with the opioid crisis? What about those who are really being left behind here. Youth and post-secondary students, and people living with disabilities are being left behind. There is nothing for people who are dealing with low income and renting their places. There is so much missing here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650985">What of overseas development assistance and that one little promise from 2005? We have not heard anybody in the government talk about 0.7% of GDP to overseas development assistance since. This budget does very little on overseas development assistance, a surprisingly small amount. NGOs and those in the development community have asked for at least put 1% of what industrialized countries are putting into COVID relief to be put into overseas development assistance. This does not come close. It comes to less than half of one per cent, and it is spread over many years. We know the developing world is going to face a food crisis as a result of COVID. There is a need for more help than ever to developing countries, and, yes, there is an increase, but it is not nearly adequate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650986">There is money for the Canadian water agency, which is terribly important, but years ago, in 1986, when I worked in government, there was the Inland Waters Directorate, which is essentially what the Canada water agency is now being created to replace because it disappeared through cuts through years. It had over 1,250 employees and I think a budget of $16 million, if memory serves. Just a drop in the bucket is going into this new agency. It needs far more than $8.5 million a year for two years. That is just not adequate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650987">On climate, the budget itself says it will get us to 36% below 2005 levels by 2030. That is debatable. There is a lot of spending in here that is really laudable. I love the green bonds idea. That is great. It is very exciting to see $4.4 billion go into what they are calling “deep home retrofits” to do more with renewable energy, but there is a lot in here that is masquerading under titles like “clean technology”, but it is dirty technology, such as small and medium nuclear reactors. If we are making hydrogen, that is great, but we have to make sure it is 100% from renewable energy, not from fossil fuel sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650988">The big elephant in the room is how we can have a budget that claims to do something about the climate crisis, but that keeps the subsidies in place, the billions of dollars a year, to produce more fossil fuels while promoting and building, as a Canadian Crown corporation, a pipeline to deliver a product that does not have a market, is uneconomical and threatens to destroy ecosystems all along the route it is being built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650989">It has already been halted because just last week they realized they were cutting down trees and endangering the habitat of migratory birds. They were, in fact, destroying the habitat of migratory birds. Our Crown corporation, which is our tax dollars at work, is building a TMX pipeline that should never be built and which is a direct threat to the climate. The Parliamentary Budget Office says that if this project has any more climate limitations imposed upon it, it will lose billions of dollars, and that was before this budget, which does have new climate limitations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6650990">There is much to like in this budget. There is much that one would want to support, but how do we get around knowing that, if we are serious about holding onto a livable world for our kids, we have to reduce greenhouse gases far more rapidly? We have to reduce them more rapidly than even the new announcement of 40% to 45% below 2005 by 2030 the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made at President Biden's climate leaders summit last week.

              <ParaText id="6650995">I find something perplexing.

              <ParaText id="6651015">We could talk at length about this budget, but I will focus on a few aspects and elaborate on those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651016">The deficit for 2021 is $354.2 billion. It is astronomical. This is the biggest deficit in Canadian history. The projected deficit for 2022 is $154 billion. If someone had told us this two or three years ago, not knowing that we would go through a pandemic and all its consequences, we would have said that it was impossible, that it would never happen. It just goes to show that we must never say never, because it did happen. Looking at all this, it may seem like it is the end of world for public finances for the Government of Canada and that we will never be able to catch up, especially with a government that has historically been considered a big spender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651017">In the press release issued with his “Fiscal Sustainability Report 2020”, the Parliamentary Budget Officer said, “Federal finances [are] sustainable over the long term—but most provinces and territories are not”. Despite this major hiccup, the Parliamentary Budget Officer tells us not to worry, that in the long run, things will turn out all right for the federal government. The reason is simple: the fiscal imbalance, which is the fundamental problem with the current federation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651018">Some people will say that the fiscal imbalance was invented by separatists complaining about the big bad federal government. However, this term was used in the 2002-03 annual management report tabled in November 2003 by Yves Séguin, a true Liberal. I have nothing against the Liberals, but in the interest of calling a spade a spade, I wanted to point out that Mr. Séguin is not a member of the Parti Québécois. He is a Liberal, just as Liberal as Mr. Gerretsen, but that is okay. Mr. Séguin mentioned the fiscal imbalance in his report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651019">This is yet another example of how Quebeckers are pioneers and trailblazers. If the rest of Canada wants to know what will happen in 20 years, it should just look at Quebec. In this case, the rest of Canada wants to copy Quebec's day care model, which has been around for 25 years. The Liberals noticed that Quebec's day care system was working well, so they woke up. That is how it goes. There are many ways in which Quebec has been a trailblazer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651020">When Quebec started talking about the fiscal imbalance, the other provinces figured that if Quebec had a fiscal imbalance, they must be in the same boat, because we all live in the same country, unfortunately. The provinces started digging and realized that they had a fiscal imbalance as well. It took them long enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651021">However, what is the cause? Was it what the Liberals did in the 1970s or the 1990s? Neither. The cause dates back to 1867 and Confederation. Even then, there was already something amiss, as the Constitution of 1867 created a fiscal imbalance. The responsibilities and spending were assigned to the provinces and Quebec, but the tax base favoured the federal government. Furthermore, under the Constitution, the federal government was given very large fiscal powers, but it could also go get money in any way it liked. That was the federal government's grounds for interfering in income taxes. When it noted that this seemed to be a paying proposition for the provinces, it took over that responsibility from them and Quebec and grabbed the cash cow for itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651022">Getting back to the fiscal imbalance and its cause, let us look at health spending. In Quebec, my country and the area I know best, health care takes up 50% of the operating budget. Half of what the Government of Quebec spends goes to health care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6651023">I see that my Conservative colleagues are wondering whether that is also the case in their provinces. It probably is, but I did not check the numbers. However, it is probably close to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651024">I am going to ask my colleagues to do some math. To keep the health care system afloat, taking into account inflation, demographics, the aging population and the modernization of equipment, Quebec needs to spend 5.2% a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651025">There is a correlation between the revenues of the Government of Quebec and nominal GDP. I looked into it and we are talking about somewhere around 3.8%. That means that Quebec is bringing in 3.8% in revenue and spending 5.2% on health care. Who is paying the difference? There are two options. Either Quebec makes cuts elsewhere or it runs a deficit in order to keep the system afloat. That is when a structural deficit occurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651026">The federal government says that it contributes to health care. People are saying that it should contribute 50%, but it actually contributes 21.7%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651027">According to the Canadian Constitution, given that the federal government has more revenue and does not have many expenditures, it needs to contribute to the provinces, ideally with no strings attached. The provinces are responsible for areas under their jurisdiction. I am not the one that said that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651028"> The member for Outremont said that it is disgraceful to hand out blank cheques. Why would she say that? It is written in the Constitution. Her country is governed by a constitution. As the Constitution says, she should just hand over a blank cheque with no strings attached. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651029">The Liberals know nothing about this field. Even in areas they are familiar with, it is frightening to see them at work. It is not hard to imagine what will happen if they get involved in something they know nothing about. They should give us the money. It would put an end to all of this, with no hard feelings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651030">As I was saying, the federal government contributes 21.7%. The Liberals are saying that is going to increase. If we look at the figures more closely, we see that health care spending represents 5.2%, but the federal government contributes an average of 3.7% or 3.8%. The federal government is not paying its fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651031">Will the current 21.7% increase or decrease? It is going to decrease. What will happen? Who will pay the difference? If the federal government does not give 5.2%, if it gives less, who will have to make up the difference? It is the provincial and Quebec governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651032">Health care is costing the provinces and Quebec a lot of money, which means there is a deficit. There is also an additional deficit because the federal government is not contributing as much as it could. That much is obvious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651033">The solution put forward by the provinces and Quebec is for the federal government to contribute 35% instead of the original 50%. That would add $26 billion for the provinces, including $6 billion for Quebec. That would help us make up the difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651034">It is about as easy for the federal government to understand that fact as it is to eat an apple through a tennis racquet. It makes no sense to the federal government, but it is perfectly obvious to everyone else. Something has to be done because the fiscal imbalance is not going away. It is going to get worse. Basically, there is nothing for Quebec and the provinces in the budget. The fiscal imbalance is going to get even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651035">Last year, the deficit was $354 billion, and this year, it is $154 billion. The Liberals budgeted nothing for this. They say they are going to wait until the pandemic is over. For every $100 the federal government spent during the pandemic, $1 went to the provinces and Quebec to help them with health care costs. That is a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651036">We cannot support this budget, because the government is condemning Quebec and the provinces to an endless deficit spiral as a result of its failure to assume its responsibilities.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6651060">Madam Speaker, I rise today in the House as the Bloc Québécois critic for families, children and social development, but also as a woman, mother, worker and, naturally, Quebecker, to discuss what I believe to be the government's key measure in this budget, the federal child care program. However, we should not be blinded by this program, nor should it cloud our critical thinking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651061">In 2021, it makes no sense, whether we consider it from a feminist, economic, educational or other viewpoint, that a mother or a father has to make the impossible decision between starting a family or staying in the workforce. It is our responsibility and our duty, as citizens first and foremost, to ensure that children and their parents have what they need to thrive and freedom from want. Child care services should be available to all for the benefit of all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651062"> Quebec realized this decades ago. It has already been 25 years since we decided to expand our social safety net by introducing a quality and, above all, universal child care system, known as the network of early childhood centres, or CPEs, in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651063">I will give a brief history. In 1997, Quebec developed an innovative family policy that led to the creation of a family allowance, a parental insurance plan, and educational and day care services for young children. The day care network was championed by women leaders, feminists, visionary leaders and, most importantly, I cannot not mention our former premier Pauline Marois, who was then the minister for families and children. I humbly commend her today and sincerely thank her on behalf of all Quebeckers and all those she inspired and continues to inspire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651064">To get back to the subject at hand, Quebec's family policy, centred around CPEs, had three objectives: ensure fairness through universal support for families and increased assistance for low-income families, help parents balance their parental and professional responsibilities, and foster child development and equality of opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651065">It is possible to reconcile those two objectives: to promote parents' economic activity and to ensure equal opportunity by providing all children in Quebec with a quality early learning environment, since those years are crucial in a child's development. This is not an impossible feat, and Quebec has made that abundantly clear. It was with these ideals in mind and by putting children at the heart of our choices, as the title of our child-focused policy at the time indicates, that Quebec implemented its child care system in the late 1990s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651066">I am a mother of three, and I have to say that my children greatly benefited from that system, as did I, my family and all of society. This child care system quickly proved its worth. Let us remember that, once it was implemented, Quebec mothers quickly caught up with and then surpassed Canada's average participation rate. The overwhelming effectiveness of this child care system and its immeasurable value to Quebec society made it a model, not only for Canada but also for other countries. I therefore have to admit that the budget presented by the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is quite right in praising the merits of our Quebec child care system and indicating that the Quebec model will serve as the foundation and model for the federal program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651067">That said, while I am certainly empathetic and happy for parents in other provinces, which will be able to follow Quebec's lead toward a more egalitarian society thanks to this investment, I have to admit that I have two major concerns about the federal government's announcement.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6651068">As I have said, Quebec chose long ago to invest in its children. The experience Quebec has gained over the past 25 years quickly made it the foremost expert in this area. We are proud and rather protective of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651069">What worries me is the federal government's systematic tendency to use its spending power to encroach on areas under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. Family policies and all related programs fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651070"> Not that I would ever need to, but if I did, I might take comfort in the government's constant attempts to take over our powers and interfere in matters that are none of its business if I thought it had any idea of what to do in its own sandbox and did not have way too much sand in the first place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651071">I would like the government to give Quebeckers their tax dollars. They know how to spend it and govern themselves. We are not short on ideas. We even dream of having our own country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651072">What also worries me, aside from this question of “everyone in their own sandbox”, which will have to be addressed at some point, is that this desire to colonize our jurisdictions might end up being more than just an idea. These so-called national strategies, whether dealing with long-term care or mental health, to speak only of this budget, are intended to Canadianize what is unique to Quebec and, worse still—although I do not really believe there can be anything worse—they are intended to substitute inexperience, even ignorance, for experience and knowledge. Quebec knows, in every sense of the word, what is good for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651073">Ottawa, of course, plans to reach an asymmetrical agreement with Quebec, an agreement that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada has quaintly described as pretty much unconditional. As Alfred de Musset wrote 200 years ago, and this is still today an apt metaphor, a door must be either open or shut. The Prime Minister likes to say one thing and its opposite, and, logically speaking, that is just nonsense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651074">If the Prime Minister has no idea of how to handle his own jurisdiction or is not thinking clearly when he tries to interfere in others' jurisdictions, if only with respect to this asymmetrical agreement, I cannot even imagine what he has in mind for child care other than to hold the provincial governments hostage. He is placing the burden on them and polishing up his image in a budget that, make no mistake, is the announcement of an electoral platform, if not an imminent election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651075">In closing, I would like to reiterate that I am happy for the improved quality of life for Canadian children and their parents that a child care system would hopefully offer and I am sure that Quebec will be generous enough to share its expertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651076">However, at the risk of repeating myself, it is imperative that Quebec gets the compensation it deserves—and I would even say more, the compensation it is due—free from conditions. Freedom is unconditional. We are not talking about “pretty much free from conditions”, but “free from all conditions”. That is what we are asking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651077">The Bloc Québécois unreservedly supports the National Assembly of Quebec, which unanimously called on the federal government to give Quebec its fair share with no conditions. Any other scenario is unacceptable. It would be an affront, and not the first one, to Quebeckers' autonomy and their right to make their own decisions. We decided that our institutions are secular, that our common language is French and that Bills 21 and 101 represent who we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651078">It is up to the National Assembly of Quebec, that is, Quebeckers and no one else, not even and above all not the Prime Minister of Canada, to decide what will happen with our child care centres. Quebeckers can—</ParaText>

Even though we live on almost opposite ends of the country, we have something very important in common and that is that we are both extremely proud of the farming and dairy production in our ridings. I am pleased to share my time with him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651099">I look forward to finding out whether he is committed, as I am, to opposing the government's budget a few hours from now. That is the purpose of my speech. Over the next few minutes, I would like to explain the three main reasons why I do not intend to vote in favour of the budget presented by the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651100">The first reason is that, as we all know, the Chaudière-Appalaches region is currently in heightened lockdown because it is in a zone that has been identified as particularly susceptible to a resurgence of cases. That is why we want as many effective measures as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651101">One very effective measure is vaccination. I am pleased to inform the House that many people over the age of 45 in Chaudière-Appalaches are getting vaccinated. Vaccination centres are operating at full capacity. We are a bit behind because of delays in vaccine distribution, for which I blame the government's poor pandemic management and its failure to sign contracts with western vaccine manufacturers in favour of cozying up to the Chinese. We ended up not getting the eagerly awaited vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651102">The good thing is that, for now, we are trying to use vaccines to rein in the pandemic, but if we had received vaccines earlier, maybe more of us would be able to gather around our barbecues on warmer days like today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651103">This failure to manage the pandemic can also be seen in how government business and the financial response to the pandemic have been managed. We Conservatives have always been in favour of effective measures to combat the adverse effects of the pandemic and to support businesses. Unfortunately, there are businesses in my riding that have been left out of this latest budget. It is on their behalf that I will be voting against the budget and will continue to work to ensure that there are specific measures for the businesses that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. That, then, is my first reason for opposing the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651104">The second reason is that the budget does not address the needs of businesses. There is a business in my riding that I greatly respect that operates in the tourism and transportation sector with a fleet of buses. I received an email this afternoon from the owner. He told me that extending the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which still has an expiration date, as proposed in the budget, is a real joke for businesses like his. Many businesses will not begin to recover for at least 12 months. For example, he relies on educational school trips and international tourists to charter his buses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651105">Some businesses are having a field day during this pandemic. Just look at our grocery stores. That sector certainly has not been hit hard by the pandemic. On the contrary, their sales are up. However, there are businesses in the tourism, culture and transportation sector that have been grappling with an almost total decline in their revenues for months now. Even if vaccination does the job and things open up, people are not going start chartering buses and taking package tours, including to our beautiful national capital. Tourists are not going to come to the Quebec City region or start travelling here from overseas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651106">There will still be a buffer period, and these people are counting on the bit of breathing room provided by the government to support them while the public health measures and guidelines remain in place. However, the government is taking a one-size-fits-all approach. The government is putting mechanisms in place and gradually removing the assistance measures, but it did not target the sectors that had specific needs, like the tourism business with a fleet of buses, of which we are very proud.

              <ParaText id="6651107">These are all businesses that have been hit hard by the pandemic, but no specific measures were created for them. The ill-conceived one-size-fits-all measures that the Liberals decided to implement backfired. Today, the labour shortage is even more acute. I am thinking in particular of restaurant owners who are looking for workers. In some instances, the measures implemented by the Liberals actually made the crisis worse instead of better. That is why I cannot support this budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651108">Not only are there no specific measures, but the government wants to spend recklessly because of the promises it made. We must remember that the Liberals had been in power for almost five years when the pandemic hit. They had made all kinds of promises and had not kept them. Today, we are in the midst of a pandemic, our economy is being battered, and the government is undertaking ambitious reform programs that will have a significant impact on the debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651109"> The third reason is the debt. People often say that all the Conservatives talk about is money and debt. Economists are saying that the debt is not that high and that we can go into debt. The only reason that is possible is that previous governments were responsible and managed taxpayers' money as though it were their own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651110">Marcel Boyer, a professor emeritus of economics at the Université de Montréal and fellow at the Center for Interuniversity Research and Analysis of Organizations, said today that, based on the figures in the budget, the federal debt is in the range of 30% to 50% of GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651111">Earlier, some of my Bloc Québécois colleagues spoke about the level of debt in Quebec. Based on the methods used by major international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, a Quebecker's debt would be 116% of GDP. There is provincial debt, federal debt and municipal debt. Mr. Boyer says that these three levels account for the 116%, with the federal share being 50% of it. However, before the pandemic and before the Liberals' obsession with racking up deficits, that figure was below 25%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651112">The Liberal government has mismanaged public funds, so I have to give it a failing grade. These same Liberals were in Washington last week telling us that they care about the environment, climate change and sustainable development. Our friends in the government need to be reminded that sustainable development is about striking a balance between the environment and the economy. Creating structural deficits will only move us further away from sustainable development and deprive future generations of the tools they will need to adopt measures to fight climate change. That is the second reason I will be opposing this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651113">I will recap the three reasons I will be opposing this budget. First, the government is spending huge amounts of money. Second, it has not created targeted measures for businesses like Autocar Excellence, the company I mentioned. Third, this budget demonstrates fiscal irresponsibility that leaves a burden on future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651114">In closing, I want to quote two different sources. Obviously, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the FADOQ, the organization that represents our seniors. It believes that this budget takes our seniors for fools and discriminates against them. Those between the ages of 65 and 75 are out of luck. The winners are those who are over the age of 75 because they are entitled to a $500 cheque from the federal government. The FADOQ is wondering why the federal government created two classes of seniors and why it thinks the cost of living and rent is higher for those aged 75 and over. The FADOQ is also wondering what the basis is for this public policy that discriminates against seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651115">The government claims to be the champion of diversity, but now it is engaging in ageism and discrimination against our seniors. Members need to hear the felicitous comments of a 95-year-old senior who managed his fortune so well that it is now worth an estimated $2 billion. He wants to know why the government does not manage Canadians' money as though it were its own and why it is acting childish and failing to make responsible decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651116">What is shameful is that this budget does not meet the objectives that taxpayers have the right to expect. That is why I intend to vote against it.</ParaText>

Right now we are focused on taking care of Canadians, as we have been over the last year. This comes down to a very simple decision: Do we want society as a whole to take on the burden of the incredible sacrifice that has come with COVID-19, economically speaking, or do we want to let individuals take on that burden by themselves?

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6651142">Madam Speaker, it is a real honour to be back in Ottawa and to have the opportunity to respond to the budget. Today I will be speaking on housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651143">I want to begin by sharing a personal story. In 2016, I distinctly remember reading in the Abbotsford News that house prices had increased over 30% during the spring season. I was filled with anxiety and the fear of missing out, the fear of being unable to provide a safe and affordable place to raise my kids, and the fear of losing hope of ever owning a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651144">When I recently hosted a telephone town hall in the tri-cities region, it was reiterated that the concerns I personally held are now the norm and they are growing. During the course of that discussion, the message received again and again was that young professionals do not see a pathway to home ownership. Hope is being lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651145">As the Conservative Party's shadow minister for housing, I scoured the budget for a plan to meaningfully address the ongoing housing affordability crisis plaguing this country. However, the budget includes nothing for young Canadians or first-time homebuyers trying to get into the market. The document barely mentions Canada's housing supply crisis. Urban indigenous people seeking long-promised support for, and autonomy over, their housing requirements were snubbed as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651146">Even though the Liberals admit that our real estate market is better for foreign investors than for Canadians trying to find a home, their proposed solution is to further consult and maybe implement a foreign buyers' tax in 2022. When it comes to addressing money laundering, the Liberals, again, turn a blind eye to this insidious problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651147"> All in all, there was an opportunity before us not to be reactive, but to respond to the needs of those trying to secure new homes, those looking for stable places to live and those seeking more security in their lives. We are not there as a nation, and the anger and frustration is growing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651148">These are serious issues with significant impacts on Canadians' futures, and they deserve far more time than I have in my 10 minutes today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651149">Housing prices exploded during the pandemic. According to the Canadian Real Estate Association, the national average rose 31.6% compared with March of last year, to a record price of over $716,000. The reasons for these skyrocketing prices are many, and if there were an easy fix we would not be having this discussion. Indeed, even in my critiques, I will acknowledge there is no easy solution to the housing problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651150">Among the new factors are the Bank of Canada's quantitative easing practices. Its manipulation of interest rates is increasing real estate and asset inflation, encouraging high debt levels and punishing savers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651151">The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate three times in the early days of the pandemic, when Mr. Poloz was governor. The current governor indicates that the bank will keep rates low until at least 2023. Mr. Poloz has stated that, “If the side effect is a hot housing market, that's one I'll take every day.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651152">I am sorry, but what about the 30-year-old renter in Coquitlam with two university degrees and a good job who is on the brink of giving up on ever owning a home? She followed all the rules and we are failing her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651153">We must not forget just how wrong CMHC's predictions about the housing market were in the early days of the pandemic. From spring 2020 all the way through winter 2021, CMHC claimed we would see a decline in average home prices of between 9% and 18%. This was despite the Canadian Real Estate Association's statistics showing a vastly different story. Members have likely caught on that the difference between CMHC's predicted 18% decline and the actual 31% increase is almost 50%. This is the Crown corporation we are entrusting with Canada's housing future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651154">As an opposition MP, I am often asked what I would do differently, and what my party would do differently. Here are some ideas today. First, the Liberals should address our housing supply gap by unlocking private capital and incentivizing municipalities to take action. We need a tax policy that encourages housing development in Canada. Increasing the ability of entrepreneurs and developers to construct purpose-built rentals is both a more elegant and more responsive approach than the tired tax-and-spend standby of the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651155">The Library of Parliament found that the tax provisions of the 1970s and 1980s, under the multiple unit residential building program, or MURB, led to the creation of 195,000 units at the lowest estimate, but potentially as many as 344,000 units.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6651156">This cost $1.8 billion in today’s dollars, about $9,000 per unit in forgone government revenue, as opposed to the Liberals' rapid housing initiative, which spends 23 times that per unit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651157">Too often I hear from entrepreneurs, developers and city councillors that municipal bylaws and NIMBYist zoning practices are keeping homes from being built. Look at the many Vancouver neighbourhoods still zoned for single-family homes that no local family can afford. Federal infrastructure dollars should be directed to municipalities that increase zoning densities and amend restrictive bylaws around transportation corridors to get more housing built. Federal support should be directed to communities that remove backlogs on development permits so builders are not waiting years for approval. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651158">The second point is that the Liberals should do what was promised and give indigenous people more autonomy. The Aboriginal Housing Management Association, or AHMA, has stated in no uncertain terms that it is outraged. Its CEO, Margaret Pfoh, said she has “never been as shocked or as disappointed” as she was when reading the budget. She went on to relay that there has been virtually no progress on the creation of an urban indigenous housing program and that this budget does not even make mention of it, despite the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> included it in the mandate letters of both the <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253775" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651159">The Conservative Party of Canada wants to increase autonomy for indigenous people and support them as they strive to meet their housing needs. It is puzzling that the government does not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651160">The third point is to have a robust plan to address the role of foreign buyers in Canada. Budget 2021 proposes consultations on the implementation of a foreign buyers' tax, which is actually an old Liberal campaign promise. The <Affiliation DbId="253812" Type="18">parliamentary secretary for housing</Affiliation> has admitted that Canada is “a very safe market for foreign investment, but not a great market for Canadians looking for choices around housing”, so I am a bit shocked the Liberal budget response is so weak. Does the government not understand just how much it dismayed Canadians to hear it finally acknowledge that the system is rigged for foreign buyers? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651161">I remember, in the summer of 2019, a homeowner on Grewall Crescent, in Mission, B.C., talked about the busloads of foreign buyers coming to neighbourhoods and dropping asking offers on homes without conditions. How is this good for a Canadian family trying to get into the market? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651162">Dr. Kershaw of Generation Squeeze appeared before the finance committee last week. He said that such a tax would only be a minor tool and is ultimately insufficient. SFU’s Dr. Josh Gordon has written about the need for continuous and comprehensive tax measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651163">We need to signal to foreign buyers that Canadian housing is for Canadians first. What about a higher capital gains rate for foreign investors? What about penalizing quick flips to avoid rampant speculation? The government needs to address this from multiple angles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651164">The fourth point is tackling money laundering. It is not only foreign buyer activity that artificially inflates the price of home ownership and puts it out of reach for Canadians. Criminals who clean illicit funds through residential property are yet another factor. There is a reason terms like the “Vancouver model” and “snow-washing” are used by global law enforcement. These problems arose in Canada and are embedded here. Yesterday on the way to the airport I heard on <I>The Roy Green Show</I> that $100 billion is laundered in Canada every year. Despite mounting evidence and recommendations from experts, we continue to see minimal action from the government. For instance, the Expert Panel on Money Laundering with a focus on B.C. real estate found a significant disconnect between FINTRAC and reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651165"> What did we get from the Liberal budget? Only $4.6 million over four years for minor FINTRAC projects when, according to experts, the organization itself is ineffective and the legislation guiding it needs to be updated. Canadians are losing trust in the institutions that are meant to protect them. We need to bring them into the 21st century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651166">The fifth point is having mortgage policies that work for Canadians. Current rules allow for the removal of $35,000 from one's RRSP for a down payment. This is not anywhere close to covering a down payment in most of Toronto and Vancouver. The Liberals' first-time home buyer's shared equity program has failed for many reasons. This becomes especially evident when we realize that increasing amortization periods to 30 years on uninsured mortgages would achieve the same goals but would cut out all the administrative costs of the shared equity program. Mortgage stress tests play an important role in protecting lenders from defaults, but when they are as divorced from reality as they currently are from interest rates, they only serve to cut out those who are struggling the most to enter the housing market.

              <ParaText id="6651192">Since the beginning of the pandemic, women have faced job losses, reduced work hours and have had to take on most of the additional unpaid care responsibilities at home. In the early stages of the pandemic, women lost jobs at almost twice the rate of men. This was particularly true for young women and younger people in general. More than a year later, women are still struggling. During the second and now the third wave of COVID-19, as the public restrictions have tightened again, women have lost jobs again at nearly double the rate of men. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651193">In times of greater isolation, we have seen an increase in intimate partner violence as well as unprecedented barriers for those seeking help. Let us pause and think about what this really means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651194"> When the world shut down, it took away safe locations for women to access outside their homes. It created new barriers for child care, employment loss and took away community supports. In the third wave of the pandemic, the problem is only getting worse for these women. Rates of gender-based violence have increased somewhere between 20% to 30%, and the severity of violence experienced by women has intensified. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651195">The prevalence of gender-based violence means that it is happening or has happened to someone near us. It means that it is happening in my community and it is happening in other members' communities too. If any of the women or girls we know are indigenous, living with a disability, lesbian, bisexual or trans, then they are at an even greater risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651196">From the onset of this pandemic, our government has been there for Canadians. We have provided the support they need to continue to make ends meet while staying safe and healthy. We also took action in providing $100 million in emergency funding to women's shelters and sexual assault centres to help them accommodate public health measures and to keep their doors open during this crucial time. This funding supported over 1,000 organizations and another 500 are receiving long-term funding. Six million people have benefited from their important work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651198">This budget includes significant, historic investments to address and prevent gender-based violence. We are committing $601.3 million over five years to continue work on the national action plan to end gender-based violence. This includes $200 million over two years to support gender-based violence organizations; $105 million over five years to enhance a gender-based violence program with a focus on initiatives that engage men and boys, combat human trafficking, support at-risk populations and survivors and provides support for testing and implementing best practices; $14 million over five years for a dedicated secretariat to coordinate the ongoing work toward the development of an implementation of a national action plan to end gender-based violence; $11 million over five years for gender-based violence research and knowledge mobilization; $55 million over five years to support gender-based violence prevention programming led by indigenous women and LGBTQ people; and $30 million over five years for crisis hotlines to serve the urgent needs of more Canadians to prevent the escalation of gender-based violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651199">It is impossible to speak about gender-based violence without acknowledging the disproportionate violence, systemic racism and the long-standing structural and inequalities faced by indigenous women, girls, two-spirit, and LGBTQ2 people in Canada. It is an injustice that simply cannot continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651200">This budget includes $2.2 billion over five years and $106.9 million ongoing to support initiatives to preserve, restore and promote indigenous culture and language, foster health systems free from racism, support culturally responsive of policing, develop an indigenous justice strategy to address systemic discrimination, enhance support for indigenous women and LGBTQ organizations, and work with indigenous partners to monitor and to measure the progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651201">We are also taking action to support a more diverse and inclusive Canada through targeted measures to promote LGBTQ equality, promote LGBTQ rights and address discrimination against LGBTQ communities both past and current. This includes investing $15 million over three years for a new LGBTQ2 projects fund. This will support community-informed initiatives to overcome key issues facing the LGBTQ communities, such as assessing mental health services and employment support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651202">Earlier this year, courageous women have been sharing their stories of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces and unfortunately, these stories are not new.

              <ParaText id="6651203">This budget also includes $236.2 million over five years and $33.5 million per year ongoing to the Department of National Defence and Veterans Affairs Canada to support the contributions to the national action plan to end gender-based violence and expand their work to support survivors and eliminate sexual misconduct and gender-based violence in the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651204">Our government had committed that there was no recovery without child care, and we are delivering on that.

Women and women alone have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. To provide every person in Canada with equal access to sexual and reproductive health resources and services, no matter where one lives, budget 2021 commits $45 million to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care support, information and services for vulnerable populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651206">Since we know that being able to stay home and stay safe is not an option for everyone, we are investing $2.5 billion in additional funding over seven years and $1.3 billion in reallocating funding to support a wide-range of affordable housing initiatives. That includes $1.5 billion to address the urgent housing needs of vulnerable Canadians; $315 million over seven years to help low-income women and children fleeing violence with their rent payments; and $250 million in reallocated funding to support the construction, repair and operating costs of an estimated 560 units of transitional housing and shelter spaces for women and children fleeing violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651207">Women still face unique and systemic barriers to starting and growing businesses, so to help women entrepreneurs adapt their businesses to meet current and future challenges, we are committing up to $146.9 million over four years to strengthen the women entrepreneurship strategy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651230">In my province of Newfoundland, there is supplemented day care, but it is not reaching farther afield into the really rural communities. That is where it needs to be, and working with the provinces and territories, we will develop a plan that provides choices for individuals and families to best meet their needs when coming up with a child care program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651231">We have heard a lot about this at the FEWO committee. For the plan, we need to work with all provinces, territories and municipalities and take into consideration cultural differences and, of course, the impacts of being in really rural and remote areas and urban centres.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651232">Mr. Speaker, I will start by acknowledging that budget 2021 was presented in the House by Canada's first female Minister of Finance. I congratulate the <Affiliation DbId="263832" Type="96">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation> for continuing to break down the barriers faced by women in the workplace. I thank everyone involved in the creation of this budget, including the <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">Minister of Middle Class Prosperity</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="272434" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, for their hard work to support all communities represented in the House and to create this comprehensive recovery plan for jobs, growth and resilience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651233">It is hard to know where to start and what to highlight in this extensive plan. Budget 2021 contains something for everyone. It has everything from proposing an early learning and child care plan to extending COVID support to supporting foreign workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651234">Over the last few months, I have asked the constituents of Surrey Centre to write to me with their top concerns for our community, which I will highlight today. I would like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to this request. The pile was high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651235">The top five concerns included affordable housing, support for seniors, the environment, public safety and addressing gun violence, and mental health and addiction care. I am very proud to say that budget 2021 addresses each of these issues and many more that are important to Canadians, especially those in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651236">I am going to begin at the end of my list because addressing the mental health of Canadians is an all-encompassing issue for which budget 2021 lays out a comprehensive plan to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651237">We have seen across the country the impact that the pandemic has had on the mental health and general well-being of Canadians. The budget provides a plan for wide-ranging support that will contribute to the overall well-being of Canadians and is going to be extremely important as we move forward with recovery from the pandemic and with ongoing efforts to create a more equal Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651238">By some estimates, the rates of anxiety and depression in Canada during the pandemic have been some of the highest we have ever seen. We also know that there has been a sharp increase in drug use and overdoses reported in British Columbia and other regions of the country. The loss of jobs, economic decline, isolation and an overall sense of uncertainty have left many Canadians trying to cope the best they can with the grief and loss of loved ones and with losing the way of life we lived only 13 months ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651239">The release of the Wellness Together platform has supported millions of Canadians with their mental health. I am sure all of my colleagues in the House can agree that the $62 million proposed for the continuation and expansion of this successful resource is a very important investment as we continue to find ways to support the mental health of Canadians across the country. However, we know that this mental health support needs to come in addition to improving well-being across a broad range of issues for Canadians. That is why I am pleased to see that this budget is using both social and economic factors to address the mental health challenges faced by Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651240">Social and economic factors like good jobs, the environment, safe and supportive communities, social inclusion, income equality and high-quality health care are highly important to the overall well-being of Canadians. To address the opioid crisis and problematic substance use, the budget is proposing additional support for the substance use and addictions programs that support harm reduction, treatment and prevention at the community level. The budget also proposes working toward a crisis hotline, as well as an extension to funding for a kids helpline. I know this funding would lend significant support to organizations on the ground that are working to reduce drug use in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651241">Finding and securing affordable housing has been a long-standing challenge for many individuals and families in Surrey. Over the last year, we have seen an increase in housing prices and The Economist has recently said that Canada has the fastest rising housing prices in the G7. That is a concern for many of my constituents who are looking to find affordable housing in a market where the demand exceeds the available supply. Funding for the national housing co-investment fund and the rental construction financing initiative, as well as $612 million to end homelessness, will help Canadians find safe and affordable homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651242">The past year has been challenging for seniors across the country, and I have heard from many seniors in my riding throughout the pandemic who are having a tough time. Our government is committed to supporting seniors, and I am receiving some great feedback regarding the support in budget 2021 directed toward seniors, which includes $90 million to help seniors stay in their homes and increasing old age security for pensioners 75 and over. Many of the seniors who reside at Kinsmen Lodge, many of my friends at the Royal Canadian Legion's Whalley branch and countless others will benefit from the additional $500 payment and the 10% increase to OAS for pensioners aged 75 and over, which starts in July 2022.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651243">The urgency to address climate change has only become more apparent as a result of the pandemic, and we know that we must continue to change the way we live and how much we consume in order to slow down global warning. The budget contains a plan to create a centre for innovation and clean energy to scale up clean technologies and help Canadians make their homes greener with retrofits. We have promised to conserve 25% of our lands and oceans by 2025, create jobs in a green economy and reduce pollution, and will provide $5 billion over seven years to the net-zero accelerator. Also, the $56 million in funding proposed for working with countries like the U.S. to create standards for zero-emission vehicle charging and refuelling stations will be beneficial as we expand our access to EV charging stations at community centres and ice rinks, building more green infrastructure for our communities, like those right here in Surrey Centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651244">Budget 2021 also includes $101 billion in proposed investments as part of the Government of Canada's growth plan to create good jobs and support a resilient and inclusive recovery. In March, I had the opportunity to host the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> at a round table discussion with organizations in Surrey that work to address and prevent gang violence in the city. They emphasized the need for more funding for local projects that address the particular needs of the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651245"> As a member of the justice committee, I have learned about the urgent need to address domestic violence and controlling and coercive behaviour. The budget proposes more than $60 million to advance a national action plan to end gender-based violence, $200 million to support gender-based violence organizations and more than $40 million to implement legislation to address gun violence and fight trafficking and smuggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651246">A broad-based plan that supports Canadians in all aspects of their lives is what we all need to recover from the pandemic. I believe that this budget lays the groundwork for a comprehensive and inclusive recovery plan for jobs, growth and resilience in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651249">Mr. Speaker, that is a great question from my hon. colleague across the way. Our approach has differed from the Conservatives' approach. What the member and members of his party proposed would have meant people taking on huge debts through their credit cards and lines of credits and borrowing against their homes at higher interest rates than are available to governments, or the provinces would have had to deal with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651250"> Our government chose a direction that cost the lowest amount for Canadians with the lowest interest rate. We took the burden upon ourselves as a taxpayers' government to help those who needed it the most: SMEs and people who lost jobs. The recovery has been working so well that most of those who lost jobs in the biggest recession or contraction we have seen since the Second World War have gotten their jobs back. However, we have more work to do, and we will continue to fight for Canadians and make sure they have a recovery.</ParaText>

Sorry, that may be true, but that is like me buying my son a geranium for his birthday when he asked for a bike. This budget may contain something for everyone, but it is not what people wanted. The federal government is using this budget to meddle in everyone's business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651252">First, there is the matter of day cares and the fact that we still do not know whether Quebec will receive unconditional compensation. Then there is high-speed Internet, an issue on which the Liberals recently joined forces with the Government of Quebec, since the latter had a better plan. The Canada-wide standards that the federal government wants to implement in long-term care homes are yet another example of interference in provincial jurisdictions. Quebec and the provinces wanted just one thing from this budget: an ongoing, unconditional increase in health transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651253"> I will speak candidly to my colleague and give him an opportunity to take back what he said, correct himself or clarify. What, exactly, does this budget contain for Quebec and the provinces?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651263">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the chamber to take part in one of the most basic responsibilities of Parliament, which is to discuss the authority of the Crown's government to spend its citizens' money. It has been a long time, over two years. The last budget was seven months before the last election, which seems like a lifetime ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651264">It is easy to forget that in the third quarter of 2019, the Canadian economy was then teetering on the brink of recession. The economy had stopped growing in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 was grim, even without the pandemic. Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio was rising, our triple A credit rating had been cut, and the government had already racked up $100 billion in new debt during a booming global economy. All of that was before COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651265">We were then expecting Bill Morneau's deficit targets would be significantly blown in the 2020 budget, but then the pandemic was declared and the budget was cancelled. We had to wait 13 more months for this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651266">There was no question that the government then had to support those who had been ordered, or even recommended, not to work. Businesses that were being asked or told to close needed to be supported. Massive emergency spending was necessary public policy at the time, from the moment public health orders took away people's paycheques and business revenues, yet that is not an excuse for refusing to table a budget, and it does not forgive the lack of fiscal discipline and lack of financial stewardship in this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651267">The borrowing contained in this budget staggers the imagination. Another $330 billion over the next five years, on top of the $355 billion in the last year alone, and there is no end in sight, merely a hope that this will mean, eventually, a return to a declining debt-to-GDP ratio starting next year. This anchor is one that had already been discarded before COVID and has no credibility coming from the government in this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651268">I do want to mention that I had intended to split my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="253037" Type="2">Steveston—Richmond East</Affiliation>, so I hope it is all right to bring it to your attention now, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651269">We have heard the government say over and over again, both before and during COVID, that deficits are all right because interest rates are so low, but Canada's accumulated debt, the majority of which is not locked in long-term, is extraordinarily vulnerable to interest rate volatility. To this, the government also responds that it expects interest rates to stay low for the foreseeable future, so there is really nothing to worry about until there is an economic recovery. Therein lies the threat to the sustainability of Canada's public finances. The sustainability of this unprecedented debt is jeopardized if interest rates rise, and yet economic recovery is precisely what will trigger interest rates to rise. Having to service such high debt at higher rates will threaten the economy all over again and eventually necessitate higher taxes or cuts to services that Canadians depend on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651270">This budget is claimed to contain over $105 billion in stimulus to ensure economic recovery, but that is not true. The single largest line item in the $105 billion of stimulus is actually emergency support funds for this year's continuing payments alone. In other words, more than a quarter of the so-called “stimulus” is really just emergency response spending because the government could not get its act together to protect Canadians from a third wave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651271">That is perhaps the biggest criticism I have about this budget. The budget does not contain what Conservatives have been asking for since last May: that the government have a plan rooted in measurable data to have a safe and permanent reopening of the economy. The very reason that this budget contains tens of billions of dollars in continued emergency COVID spending is that the government has failed to use the tools that already exist to help Canadians live safely in a COVID-19 world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651272">When the economy first shut down during the first wave, there was no other sensible option based on the information available to policy-makers in March 2020, but since then the government has failed to procure vaccines in time. It has failed to procure, approve and ensure the wide distribution of rapid, at-home test kits approved for screening purposes. The only meaningful and timely response that the government has had to COVID is to spend, while hoping that things will get better.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6651273">There is no question the government's vaccine procurement is a disaster. Canada is taking surplus vaccines from other countries and raiding the COVAX system for developing nations. This is because even its terribly slow delivery schedule from the manufacturers is not coming through. The inadequate health response is what is driving the dangerous levels of debt contained in this budget, and the absence of a plan that would have avoided the ravages of a third wave threatens to destroy thousands more small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651274">I have said it before in this House many times. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our communities, they are the backbone of the Canadian economy, and the owners, workers and customers are our neighbours and our friends. These small businesses are the ones that have borne the brunt of COVID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651275">Yes, this budget contains extensions to the supports many small businesses need just to survive through the summer, but that is not what small businesses want. They want their customers back. They want to be open. They want to serve the needs of their communities. They want to give their own friends and neighbours their jobs back. They want to at least try to put the hopes and dreams of their business shattered by COVID back together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651276">Small businesses do not want to take on more debt. The average small business has already taken on $170,000 in debt since the pandemic began, and these debts threaten their recovery. Some of this debt is in the form of low or no-interest loans from government aid programs, but the majority of this debt actually comes in the form of bills that small businesses just cannot pay, things like their rent or their suppliers' invoices. These debts threaten to cascade throughout the economy and prevent recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651277">By the end of last year, 60,000 small businesses had failed, and now nearly 200,000 more are hanging by a thread. There is one particular group of small businesses that has been completely, and at this point one must even conclude deliberately, ignored by the government, and that is the small businesses that had the terrible misfortune to have opened their doors in late 2019 or early 2020. In most cases, the owners of these businesses put their life savings into their businesses and incurred significant debt to pursue a dream to open, start or reinvent a small business, but these businesses have nothing, and there is nothing in this budget that will help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651278">The <Affiliation DbId="241633" Type="4">Minister of Small Business </Affiliation> and her <Affiliation DbId="253771" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> have been saying for months that new businesses will be supported, but they have done nothing. This once-in-two-years budget still ignores these businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651279">Just this weekend, I received an email from the owner of a business who opened an auto service business in Calgary in October 2019. This business cannot even acquire a CEBA loan, which is among the easiest ones to qualify for, never mind access to the other aid measures. This small business is not going to be sustained by words. It needs cash, or better still, its customers from a fully opened economy and a vaccinated population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651280">Between platitudes such as “we have your back”, “we will stop at nothing” and “we will continue to work for new programs for new businesses”, the government will occasionally mention it is concerned about the integrity of its programs and is making sure businesses do not suddenly materialize and take advantage of its programs. Of course nobody wants anyone to game the system, but with all the red tape in this country, it takes months to even get a building permit to start a new restaurant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651281">Somebody who opened in March of 2020, spending their own money and exhausting their finances long before COVID began, is left out of the programs. There are thousands of these businesses. They are in every riding. I know every MP in this House is getting emails from these kinds of businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651282">There is so much more I could say, but I will end by pointing out there are many necessary economic support measures contained in this budget, but they are necessary precisely because the government has failed so spectacularly to protect Canadians from the third wave. It would be imprudent to support a government that adds so much debt without a coherent plan to manage this debt and reduce it over time. There is just no fiscal anchor or even any credibility with the government concerning its fiscal anchors.</ParaText>

The reason why governments are okay with taking on and having deficits is because as long as they are growing their economy at a pace that outpaces that debt, it is realistic to take it on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651284">Members do not need to take my word for it. They can ask Brian Mulroney or Stephen Harper. Out of the 16 years that they were in government, they ran deficits 14 of the 16 years. In fact, the Conservatives' own plan says that it will take them 10 years to get back to balanced budgets. This is the current Conservative leader saying that he will run deficits for 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651285">On spending, the member is absolutely correct. It is all happening right now because it is to help Canadians get through this. Therefore, on the other end of this, as soon as it is over, the deficits are going to drop considerably. Why do the Conservatives need 10 years to bring it back to a balanced budget then?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651286">Mr. Speaker, I do not know where to start with that. Has the member even looked at the chart that shows the deficit projections? The government will never balance a budget. There is no plan anywhere to come even close to it. The Liberals' plan, which is contained in this budget, hopes that they might get below 50% debt-to-GDP by the end of its projections. That is if nothing goes wrong between now and 2026.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651293">Mr. Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="253771" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Small Business</Affiliation> has complained that I complain too much about how the government spends like there is no tomorrow. I am here again to do just that. After all, having seen the recent budget, how could I not. Let me point out a few points beforehand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651294"> Budget 2021 proposes overspending by $143 billion, enough to sign up every Canadian for nearly $4,000 in extra debt, an equal albeit an unwanted opportunity for each man, woman, child and senior. A deficit of $143 billion for one year is already an unfathomably large number. To put that into perspective, 143 billion years ago, not even time existed. Cosmologists say that our universe and the time that goes with it only came into being about 14 billion years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651295">Let us pull ourselves back from fantasy and to reality, a reality where the Liberal government says to the average Canadian that the government knows best how to spend Canadians' money. A whole-of-government approach from cradle to grave might be a valid and perhaps worthy discussion in this chamber when our nation is drowning in budgetary surpluses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651296">However, when we are looking at the immediate future, figuring out how to get the millions of struggling Canadians back on their feet, it is clearly not the time for introducing utopian, socialistic, imagineered and unproven projects. We owe that to our future generations when we are deciding to subject them to the evermore massive debt burdens to not surrender to our reckless binge spending desires on their credit card.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651297">Instead of this reasonable and responsible approach, we see an effort to blindly push forward policy to grow the state and the state's control over our lives. To paraphrase Khrushchev, we will be fed small doses of socialism until we finally wake up and find we already have communism. I, for one, will fight to keep that from happening, and as a parent, I would say parents know better than politicians what is best for their families. Canadian families do not need an Ottawa-knows-best, one-size-fits-all child care system. For those who support this idea and do not share my concerns, be prepared to be let down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651298">For decades, Liberal governments have been promising a government regulated child care system but have not delivered. This promise will be no different than the promises to introduce electoral reform or holding off Canada's carbon emission, having the budget balance itself or planting two billion trees. I bet that if money did grow on trees, we might finally see the government start planting those trees. It is no wonder the Liberals have not updated the “promises kept” page on their website since 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651299">What do they have to show besides making people feel let down? With budget 2021, unemployed Canadians hoping to see an atmosphere for new job creation and economic opportunities for their families are going to feel let down. Workers who have had their wages cut and hours slashed, workers in industries like forestry, tourism and hospitality or work within the B.C. fisheries industry who have lost jobs and were hoping to see a plan to reopen the economy are going to feel let down. Families that cannot afford more taxes, that are struggling to save more money for their children’s education or to buy a home are going to feel let down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651300">Additionally, they will suffer from the inflationary effect of pumping hundreds of billions into the economy. Costs will go up, interest rates will go up and we will see the social spending dry up. When that happens, feeling let down may be overshadowed by more imminent threats such as staying afloat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651301"> Budget 2021 is not stimulus spending focused on creating jobs but spending on Liberal partisan priorities. What has been proposed is a reimagined Canadian economy that dabbles in risky economic ideas, like abandoning Canada’s world-renowned and sustainable natural resource industries, leaving our economy in a precarious position.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6651302">We must approach COVID emergency spending with a lens of compassion, recognizing that what we do now will have lasting effects on the lives of countless Canadians. Acting responsibly now will save them from suffering later in the medium and longer term. Unfortunately, this budget does nothing to secure long-term prosperity for Canadians, and when I say “unfortunately”, I mean it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651303">Conservatives do not want to see Canadians let down. Yes, we critique the government for spending too much and we critique it for spending not enough, but this is obviously not a contradiction. Surely even the Liberal members can see how the government is spending too much on its pet projects and not enough on what matters to ordinary Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651304">Conservatives represent the real people this government has lost touch with. We give voice to their concerns and align with their priorities, which I emphasize include putting food on the table and keeping resources like gas and electricity affordable so that people can continue to drop off and pick up their kids from soccer or hockey games once the pandemic is over. We need to focus on keeping families safe and keeping Canadians gainfully employed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651305">My home province of British Columbia is in the middle of an opioid epidemic, which occupies merely half a page among the 725 pages of the Liberal budget. It does not do much to enhance opioid addiction treatments. The Liberals have failed to deliver a comprehensive, recovery-oriented plan to tackle Canada's addiction crisis. This is an area of life and death where help is needed. This is a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651306">Conservatives had been advocating for mental health supports long before this budget was introduced. Many Canadians are facing mental health challenges as a direct result of the pandemic. Many wonder why budget 2021 has not provided much-needed support for provinces to tackle mental health issues or other direct COVID-19 consequences. These are two areas that could be greatly expanded. Canada would benefit from seeing comprehensive approaches taken to these issues and seeing them treated as priorities now and going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651307">Like the George Massey tunnel replacement project in Richmond, Canada's infrastructure is in desperate need of reinvigoration, but new spending on ideological Liberal vanity projects does nothing for it or for projects like the SkyTrain extension or further diking in low-lying, populated urban areas such as Richmond. These are real, on-the-ground priorities. B.C. is a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651308">I believe that Canadians can be confident that the Conservatives know what their priorities are. With a Conservative recovery plan, we will secure their future by recovering millions of jobs and introducing policies that result in better wages and help struggling small businesses get back on their feet. We must show progress in safely reopening the Pacific cruise routes, classical tourism and associated industries, which employ, by the way, tens of thousands of B.C. residents directly or indirectly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651309">Canada's Conservatives kept Canada from being dragged into the pits of despair and brought us out of the last recession. Canadians who are worried about their future know that we will do it again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651310">Let us stay down on earth with our budgets, away from grandiose and intangible, undeliverable promises. If the government keeps spending as it is, there will be no bright tomorrow for our future generations. Canadians deserve a government that brings hope and confidence in the future. I intend to work with my Conservative colleagues to deliver them such a government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651326">I want to take these last few minutes to talk about veterans in this budget. There are over 15,000 veterans waiting for their disability claims to be processed. Last year we know that the Parliamentary Budget Officer did an in-depth review of this wait time, and I want to be clear: it is up to two years for some of our veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651327">The feedback was very simple. The just-over 300 people who VAC has hired temporarily need to be put in place permanently. To address this backlog, even more need to be hired very rapidly. We are already behind. With the government opposing the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report, I am not sure when these veterans are actually going to see the resources they rightly deserve delivered to them. The budget does list $29 million for VAC to hire permanent case workers, but this is a reannouncement of money set aside in budget 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651328">Now we have the budget offering veterans yet another program to fill in the gap. The veterans I hear from are very clear. They are tired of new programs. What they want is simple: one case worker who stays with them. They want to call that one person who knows their file and understands their situation, their family and the situation they are in, so they do not have to keep repeating themselves, starting over from the beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651329">This budget would provide $140 million for this program to fill in the gap, but I have a lot of questions. Will this new program simply be available to everyone who is stuck on the backlog of the disability claim? If it can do that, why can they not just approve the original claim and make the actual resources available, instead of another patchwork program? Are we just going to see another program that has to be applied for and takes a really long time to process, putting people on another list, waiting?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651330">Another important gap in the budget is that there is absolutely nothing to deal with the “marriage after 60” clause. The gold-digger clause was created in the early 1900s to prevent women from marrying older veterans and getting their pensions when they died. The reality is that this has always been unfair and very sexist. Many veterans live well into their 80s or more, and their loving partners care for them. I think most Canadians support love when it happens, and we should respect that. We now know that some veterans are living in poverty because they married after 60 and are giving up part of their current pension to put aside for the future. Why are we punishing veterans for getting married at any age?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651331">I want to remind everyone in the House that the RCMP is included in this. Recently I spoke with the RCMP's veterans association and heard loud and clear that this issue is urgent and needs to be dealt with now, so I hope this gets on the Order Paper for the minister very quickly, and I want to thank members for allowing me these very few minutes to talk about how underserved our veterans are, and how the government needs to do so much better.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6651342">Mr. Speaker, ensuring that vaccines are available for all vulnerable people around the world is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. I do not want to be an alarmist or want this to be seen as a partisan attack. Rather, I am speaking from my heart in the most urgent way I can to say that we, as human beings, are facing an existential, ethical, moral and intellectual threat. I am deeply afraid that the Liberal government is making the wrong choice to protect Canadians and the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651343"> As we all know, we are in the midst of the third wave of the COVID-19 global health pandemic. COVID-19 has killed close to three million people so far worldwide. Countries have had their economies crippled and their health care systems demolished. Of course, we have spent countless hours in the House debating the impacts on our economy and the measures we need to take to address those impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651344">What we have not addressed, and what the government refuses to address, is Canada's critical role in combatting COVID-19 around the world. This is a global pandemic that will require a global solution. It will require that wealthy countries do what they can to protect the health and well-being of citizens and the economy. Perhaps more importantly, it will require that wealthy countries such as Canada recognize this and work to help citizens in every country to ensure we can all recover from COVID-19. That is simply not happening in Canada with the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651345">Instead, we know the government is refusing to support a proposal to the World Trade Organization that would waive certain intellectual property rights and allow low-income countries to manufacture their own vaccines and medicines to combat COVID-19. While millions suffer and die, variants develop and the global economy crashes, the government delays and deflects. It has been over six months since the intellectual property waiver proposal was first made to the World Trade Organization by NDN South Africa. Over those six months, the government has delayed providing a concrete response, instead asking questions for which it already has the answers and tiptoeing around its refusal to support the measures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651346">We do not have the luxury of time. While the government is delaying and taking the side of big pharma, ensuring record multibillion-dollar profits for these companies, the virus is evolving. It does not care whether one lives in a low-income or high-income country. It does not care about big pharma's profits. It will continue to spread around the world and continue to evolve as long as we fail to recognize that this is a global crisis that requires a global response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651347">This is the proverbial tip of the iceberg. We are in a global race between vaccines and variants right now, and the variants are winning. The intellectual property waiver is not just about giving poor countries the tools they need to combat COVID-19 for their own citizens. It is also about protecting Canadians. Our health, well-being and economy depend on defeating COVID-19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651348">Canadians are not asking the government to protect big pharma. Canadians are asking the government to protect them. When will the government sign on in support of the intellectual property waiver at the WTO?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651349">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague opposite from <Affiliation DbId="252961" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> for this opportunity to deliver my first remarks as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651350">The Government of Canada is committed to a comprehensive global response to COVID-19 that leverages the entire multilateral system in supporting the research, development, manufacture and distribution of safe and effective COVID-19 diagnostics, equipment, therapeutics and vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651351">With respect to the proposed COVID-19-related waiver from certain provisions of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, Canada has not rejected the proposed waiver and is working with an range of WTO members to seek to understand the specific nature and scope of any concrete intellectual property, challenges experienced by WTO members related to or arriving from the TRIPS agreement such that concrete and census-based solutions can be found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651352">Canada also continues to engage WTO members on the use of existing public health flexibilities under the TRIPS agreement and as affirmed by the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health and continues to share its own experiences in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651353">As the Doha declaration emphasizes, the TRIPS agreement is part of the wider national and international effort to address public health problems. In addition to ongoing discussions on the waiver, Canada is actively engaged in the work of the WTO Ottawa Group on the trade and health initiative, which aims to strengthen global supply chains and support the delivery of essential medicines and medical supplies around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651354">Canada is highly supportive of the access to COVID-19 tools accelerator and its vaccine's pillar, the COVAX facility. In parallel to the ongoing TRIPS waiver discussions, Canada has also encouraged the WTO director-general's efforts to enhance the WTO's role in dialogue with the pharmaceutical sector toward accelerating the production and distribution of affordable, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and other medical products in coordination with the World Health Organization and other relevant organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651355">The Government of Canada remains actively committed to a robust, multi-faceted and global effort to address the pandemic that draws upon all the necessary resources and tools available in the international rules-based trading framework as well as new mechanisms for global co-operation on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and other medicinal products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651356">As equitable, timely and affordable access to testing treatments and vaccines will be critical for controlling and ending this pandemic, Canada looks forward to continued engagement with all members of the international community to find solutions to these global challenges.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651357">Mr. Speaker, the member says that the Liberals have not rejected the TRIPS waiver, but by delaying, by deflecting, by asking for more information that they already have, they are failing to support us. They are failing all of the people who are looking for the COVID vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651358"> Now, when the world needs Canada to step up and support global efforts, the government is failing. I am beyond frustrated. I am beyond exasperated by them. I am tired of these excuses. Over 280 European parliamentarians support the waiver. Even members of his own party, their own members of Parliament, have called upon them to support the waiver. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651359">There are no more questions left unanswered. The government needs to do what is right. It needs to support Canadians. It needs to support our lives, our economy. It needs to stop supporting big pharma at the risk of so many people being able to get the COVID vaccine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651362">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak this evening on behalf of women and men who have been victimized by sexual misconduct in the military. Each case of sexual misconduct is significant, and addressing this issue and the systemic causes behind it must be a top priority for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651363">Our women and men in uniform, as well as our veterans, entered into our military with the highest ideals of service. They understood that they were going to be asked to serve in the most difficult of situations and perhaps give up their lives. What they did not expect or deserve was conflict and assaults from within our own ranks. They deserve a fair hearing and meaningful action in response to their trauma, not half measures, lip service and shameful attempts to sweep allegations under the rug.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651364">On March 12, I posed a question to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. I framed my question around the March 11 edition of <I>The Fifth Estate</I>. In the segment “Broken honour”, Sergeant Jessica Miller revealed her experiences of sexual abuse by a superior while at sea. Under the guise of Operation Honour, Jessica hoped for justice. However, it was revealed that Jessica's abuser received a mere code of conduct discipline violation, no criminal charges and a move to a posting of his choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651365">Jessica Miller is only one of the victims who have come forward in an effort to expose systemic issues of sexual misconduct within the Canadian Armed Forces ranks. What is more, the lax consequences applied to Miller's perpetrator are just one example of the lack of seriousness with which they are being addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651366">We have recently come to learn that this pattern of impunity can be found all the way to the top. For three years, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> knew about the sexual misconduct allegations against General Vance and did nothing to address them. I asked for a justification from the minister, but the response I received was troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651367">How can the government claim that it has “no tolerance for misconduct”? Clearly that is not the case when a perpetrator received no criminal charges and was given an alternative posting of his own choice. Where is the accountability in that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651368">I heard words from the member who responded that rang with excuses and indifference, like “institutional culture is complex and change takes time”. It does not have to be that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651369">My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253002" Type="2">Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill</Affiliation>, recently wrote about military sexual misconduct in the context of a similar situation in the U.S. Tailhook, of course, involved up to 83 women and men sexually assaulted by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers at an event over the course of a weekend. The U.S. military response was swift and decisive. Top brass were fired and a policy of zero tolerance was established. As my colleague wrote on the fallout from Tailhook, “There was to be no doubt that the U.S. military would be a place where women could serve equally and with pride.” My colleague wrote that this is Canada's Tailhook moment, and I wholeheartedly agree with her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651370">We need a wholesale change of perspective and culture within our military, and we need it now. Sexual assault and harassment go largely unreported because of fears that complaints will not be taken seriously or that victims will face repercussions. As I mentioned earlier, Jessica Miller is just one example of a service member who has voluntarily come forward, but she is an exception. As it stands, women and men are not comfortable with coming forward. It is saddening to realize that there are far more victims sitting in silence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651371">At the outset of Operation Honour, General Vance stated, “Any form of harmful sexual behaviour has been and always will be absolutely contrary to good order and discipline.... It is a threat to operational readiness and a threat to this institution.” Clearly Operation Honour is a misnomer when our top soldier is not a part of the solution but a part of the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651372"> I hope and pray that continued exposure to this systemic issue will encourage more victims to break their silence and that this critical mass will persuade the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to undertake wholesale reform and fire those who need to be fired.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651373">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252542" Type="2">Yorkton—Melville</Affiliation> for bringing such an incredibly important issue to the floor of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651374">Let me start by stating our position in the clearest possible terms. Our government does not, and will not, accept any form of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence from anyone, regardless of rank or position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651375">We are committed to ensuring that survivors and affected persons have access to a range of supports, and are treated fairly and compassionately. We must take care of our people, providing them with a workplace free from harassment and discrimination. It is written into our defence policy. It is written into the minister's mandate letters, and it is my personal belief system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651376">Everything that we do must be informed by those with lived experiences. Sexual misconduct is harmful beyond measure. Our government has worked hard, first by responding to Justice Deschamps' report. We put measures in place focused on understanding the issue, preventing harm from occurring in the first place, addressing incidents when they happen, and providing support to survivors and those impacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651377">We created the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre, completely independent from the chain of command. We launched new mandatory training and education. We partnered with Statistics Canada to conduct surveys so we could better understand the scope of the problem. We reviewed 179 old cases that had been categorized as unfounded. We created new specialized teams within our military police and our prosecution service to address sexual misconduct. We sought out expert external advice, and we implemented new programs and policies. Last year we released a preliminary cultural change strategy. All of this work was essential and foundational.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651378"> However, we have heard recent survivors, coming forward so bravely, with very traumatic and difficult stories. This is something that is heartbreaking. Those who have come forward, and those I have personally heard, have stories that have shaken me deeply. I will remember and carry them with me forever. It has to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651379">It is clear that Operation Honour has not produced the solutions we had hoped it would. It is extremely clear that we have a lot more work to do. We will learn from what has not worked and develop a deliberate plan to go forward. It must be an evergreen process, and it is urgent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651380">We need to make it easy and accessible for anyone, at any level and any gender, to report an incident. They need to have confidence in those reporting mechanisms. That is why we will be developing an independent reporting structure to look into all allegations. We must ensure that this kind of abuse of power, and that is what it is, an abuse of power, ends and never happens again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651381">As the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have stated, all options are on the table. We are listening. Eliminating all forms of misconduct, abuse of power and violence, and creating a safe work environment for everyone in the defence team has always been our top priority. We know that any organization, including the Canadian Armed Forces, must work hard to eliminate the toxic masculinity that creates an unacceptable culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651382">All avenues to a safer future for the women and men serving in the Canadian Armed Forces are going to be considered in order to change that culture. We owe it to our members and to Canadians to get this right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651383">Mr. Speaker, I have addressed the deep lack of confidence our serving members, veterans and Canadians have in the Liberal government's ability to deal with the military sexual trauma pandemic taking place within our military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651384">In this House, I called upon the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to extend the deadline for the CAF-DND sexual misconduct class action, currently scheduled to close on November 25. That is too soon. This is a painful experience for victims, who have to recount traumatic experiences in great detail. It is overwhelmingly difficult. Ultimately, the deadline is going to prevent victims from coming forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651385">Extending the deadline, at least until those responsible are held responsible, is one measure the government could take right now, in good faith, to indicate to our service members and veterans that justice will be served.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651386">Will the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and the Liberal government do the right thing and remove the looming deadline on the sexual misconduct class action?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651387">Mr. Speaker, I assure the hon. member opposite that all options are on the table. That is why budget 2021 committed over $236 million to eliminate sexual misconduct and gender-based violence in the Canadian Armed Forces, including expanding the reach of the sexual misconduct response centres and providing online and in-person peer-to-peer support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651388">It is clear that the measures we have taken already are not enough, and we will have more to announce in the coming weeks for the next steps. We know the solutions we have put forward have not moved fast enough, and we are listening to survivors and those impacted. Canadian Armed Forces members make enormous sacrifices to protect Canadians, and regardless of rank or gender, they have an undeniable right to be able to serve in safety. We can and we must do better, and we will.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253046" Type="2">Mr. Eric Melillo (Kenora, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6651389">Mr. Speaker, in March I asked the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> why his government is moving to confiscate legally purchased firearms from hunters and sport shooters instead of getting tough on real criminals. In response, the minister claimed that his government is putting “Canadians' safety first.” However, if the Liberals were trying to put safety first, they would not have voted against a Conservative bill to impose tougher sentences on criminals caught with smuggled guns. They also would not have introduced a bill allowing lighter sentences for people convicted of serious gun crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651390">In February, the government introduced a bill removing mandatory minimum sentences for crimes like weapons trafficking, using a firearm in commission of an offence, possession of a loaded handgun, illegally firing a weapon with intent, robbery with a firearm, extortion with a firearm and more. I fail to understand how this is putting Canadians' safety first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651391">The Conservatives have a plan to actually keep Canadians safe from violent crime. That plan includes strengthening anti-gun and anti-gang units, supporting the CBSA in cracking down on cross-border smuggling, supporting mental health initiatives and bringing in real consequences for real criminals. Our plan does not include cracking down on duck hunters while letting violent criminals off with a slap on the wrist, as the Liberals are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651392">The Liberals' plan to confiscate guns from law-abiding Canadians is, frankly, overreaching and incoherent. They hide behind vague terms like “military style” without ever defining what that label means, all the while passing legislation and moving forward on measures to ban many rifles used for sport shooting and hunting. With the latest firearm ban they announced last year, it was reported that several hunting rifles and shotguns were included on the list. This is truly not putting Canadians' safety first; it is only criminalizing lawful gun owners and law-abiding Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651393">I raise this issue again because I have heard from many in my riding who are deeply concerned about the government's approach to this. Aside from COVID, it is far and away the single biggest issue I have heard about in my riding. I get the greatest number of calls and emails about this, and people are writing by mail too. They are concerned about the government's approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651394">I have heard from countless constituents about this, who reached out to me from Weagamow, Fort Severn, Lac Seul and first nations across the region. They are concerned that the government is limiting their ability to hunt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651395">When I visited the Lake of the Woods Gun Club, I heard many concerns about the Liberals' misguided priorities. When I went shooting at the Sioux Lookout Handgun and Rifle Club, I heard about the already robust set of rules that members must follow. When visiting the Vermilion Bay Rod &amp; Gun Club, I was urged to stand up against the government's heavy-handed attack on our way of life in northwestern Ontario. I have heard similar concerns raised by members of the clubs in Ear Falls, Dryden and Red Lake and by residents across northwestern Ontario. Some residents who are not even living in my riding have reached out to me to share their concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651396">I will take this opportunity to ask the parliamentary secretary my question again. Will the government stop targeting law-abiding hunters and sport shooters and instead take real measures to fight real criminals?</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="253800" Type="18">Mr. Joël Lightbound (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6651397">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Kenora for this interesting adjournment debate. It is a topic that concerns us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651398">To answer the question he asked at the very end, I can assure him that there is nothing in Bill <Document DbId="11102978" Type="3">C-21</Document> that takes aim at the vast majority of law-abiding Canadians, whether they are hunters, sport shooters or collectors who obey the law and who have our respect. There is absolutely nothing in Bill C-21 that targets law-abiding Canadians who own guns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651399">As for the gun smuggling he referred to in his question a few weeks ago, which he addressed to the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, it should be noted that Bill C-21 includes tougher sentences for those who are involved in smuggling operations. The maximum has increased from 10 to 14 years. It is rather surprising to see the Conservatives oppose such a measure. As for the bill he talked about in his speech, there was nothing in there that addressed smuggling as such.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651400">Now let us look at what we are actually doing. Next Saturday marks the first anniversary of the measures we put in place to ban over 1,500 models of military-style firearms and their variants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651401">While the Conservatives listen to the gun lobby, we listened to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, which has been calling for such measures for decades, as have many civil society groups. Last May, we took extraordinary and necessary steps to ban more than 1,500 models of military-style firearms. These are weapons that were designed not for hunting or sport shooting, but for tactical situations for their effectiveness on the battlefield. They have a lethal character that makes them inappropriate for civilian use and makes them too dangerous in our society. That is why we decided to ban them on May 1, 2020, and I am very proud of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651402">Last month, we introduced Bill C-21 to make further headway in our fight against gun violence. This bill will complete the ban on military-style firearms, which have no place in our society as I mentioned. Once passed, the bill will help reduce domestic violence and prevent suicide with the implementation of a red flag and yellow flag regime. These measures will allow individuals and the authorities to act more quickly and remove weapons from individuals who are a danger to themselves, society or their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651403">The bill will help fight the criminal use of firearms and their diversion to the black market by requiring that a firearms licence be presented to import ammunition and by giving police organizations greater powers to share information when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a licence holder is supplying weapons to criminals. It is a measure that the Conservatives should support. We are surprised that they are not supporting these types of measures, which are enshrined in Bill <Document DbId="11102978" Type="3">C-21</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651404"> The bill will also create new offences for altering a gun's cartridge magazine and for depicting violence in firearms advertising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651405">In short, we believe it is essential to reduce firearms smuggling and trafficking in Canada to make our communities safer. I sincerely hope that our opposition colleagues will help us pass this bill, which, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, will also amend the Criminal Code to increase the maximum penalty of imprisonment for smuggling and trafficking firearms from 10 to 14 years. That is important. It sends a message to all judges about how significant these types of offences are and how seriously we take them because they have very clear impact on violence in our communities. I would certainly like to see my colleague from Kenora support Bill C-21.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651406">This bill will also prevent people who have been arrested for smuggling from entering Canada by amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651407">I see that my time is running out. We could continue to talk at length about the good things that Bill C-21 has to offer, as well as the investments our government has made in budget 2021 to provide more resources to police authorities, whether the RCMP or border services, to combat trafficking and smuggling.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651408">Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the parliamentary secretary once again used those terms, “military style” and “assault style”, without a clear definition of what those are. He claims that the firearms that the government has moved to ban are not used for hunting or sports shooting. However, in my riding, many people are seeing the guns that they do use for hunting and sports shooting on the Liberals' list of now illegal firearms. There is clearly a disconnect between his talking points and what is actually happening on the ground. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651409">Also, I am surprised that the Liberals, who claim to want to make Canada safer, voted against a Conservative bill that would impose tougher sentences on those who are found in possession of an illegally acquired firearm, a smuggled firearm. If the government is so committed to combatting gun crime, why did its members vote against this common-sense, Conservative motion?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6651410">Mr. Speaker, I am always puzzled to hear those types of criticisms from the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651411">When the Conservatives formed the government, they proceeded to make the biggest cuts to our intelligence services and our police forces, such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the RCMP, and border services officers. Their austerity plan included massive cuts to technical resources and staff deployed on the ground to fight smuggling or illegal gun violence. The Conservatives talk a big game, but do very little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6651412">In contrast, without looking back to the past five years, but simply looking at the investments we made in the past year, the 2020 fall economic statement provided $250 million to target the causes of violence and prevent it upstream by investing directly in our communities. More recently, just last week in the budget, we allocated $312 million over five years to the RCMP and the Canada Border Services Agency to better support their efforts to fight gun violence. All of that speaks much louder than the Conservative rhetoric. </ParaText>
