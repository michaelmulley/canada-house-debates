              <ParaText id="6368175">She said: Mr. Speaker, today, I have the honour to introduce a bill to amend the Canada Labour Code, the Official Languages Act and the Canada Business Corporations Act so that federally regulated businesses in Quebec respect the Charter of the French Language and implement measures to promote the use of French as the main language at work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368176">This is a matter of respect for one of Canada's founding peoples and a way to promote one of the things that makes Quebec unique. No one can deny that what makes Paris unique is the fact that people are welcomed there and able to work there in French. It only makes sense that such should also be the case in Quebec, the last great bastion of the French language in North America. We should be proud of this language and do everything possible to positively promote it every day.</ParaText>

The petitioners are calling for amendments to the legislation that would leave in place reasonable safeguards. Those amendments have been proposed, but the government has continually rejected these very reasonable amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368179">Amendments that the petition specifically references are for the 10-day reflection period. The petitioners want that left in place. They recognize that already the 10-day reflection period can be waived with the consent of the doctors involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368180"> The petitioners highlight their concerns with respect to Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> and the need for amendments to protect vulnerable people, which is what the committee has been hearing from experts and disability advocates.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368186">The petitioners are concerned about the safeguards that would be removed from that legislation, including the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of witnesses required for it to be carried out. The removal of the second requirement of independent witnesses would reduce the oversight of the procedure, leaving vulnerable persons at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368187">Therefore, the petitioners are asking the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia and put additional measures in the bill, which is being proposed and amended at the justice committee.</ParaText>

The petitioners say that we should ensure we do our best to save those who are vulnerable and disabled and ensure that they understand their lives matter too.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368208"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11, An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="3">Bill C-11. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="6368209"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to discuss Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the digital charter implementation act, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368210">As members know, data and digital transformation is completely changing the way we access information, buy goods and services, connect with each other and live in our communities and cities. This digital transformation has been accelerated by the pandemic, and we are seeing more Canadians moving their activities online. Canadians are using more digital services and sharing more data online than ever before. They want to know that their personal information will be safe and that they are protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368211">Recently, the Privacy Commissioner surveyed Canadians and found that the vast majority of Canadians, 92% of them, are concerned about the protection of their privacy, so this is an important issue to many Canadians. That is one of the reasons why last year I launched the digital charter, a set of 10 principles that lay down the foundation that will allow us to build an innovative, digital economy that is inclusive, people-centric and built on trust.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368212">The principles of Canada's digital charter give Canadians more control over their data while helping Canadian companies innovate, grow and create quality jobs for middle-class Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368213">I would like to take this opportunity to remind members that the principles of the digital charter were very clear, and they focused on control and consent. Canadians will have control over what data they are sharing and who is using their personal data and for what purposes, and will know that their privacy is protected. This is one of the key principles we laid out in the digital charter.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368214"> Transparency, portability and interoperability will enable Canadians to easily manage access to their personal data and to transfer it without undue burden.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368215">Data and digital for good is another principle that was laid out in the digital charter. The Government of Canada will ensure the ethical use of data to create value, promote openness and improve the lives of people at home and around the world. How can we harness data to solve problems?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368216">Another key element was strong enforcement and real accountability. There will be clear, meaningful penalties for violations of the law and regulations that support these principles so that Canadians can rest assured that their privacy will be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368217">As members will see, the principles of the digital charter are firmly embedded in the legislation before us today. On top of this foundation sits three pillars: consumer control, responsible innovation and a strong enforcement and oversight mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368218">Let me begin with outlining how Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would give Canadians more control and greater transparency in the manner in which companies handle their information. It would do this by introducing important rules for consent, the right to delete information, data mobility and algorithmic transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368219">With regard to consent, Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would enhance consumer control by requiring organizations to get meaningful consent from Canadians. This means individuals would get specific information in plain, simple language, not the 30-page legal document that no one reads. This, in turn, would allow individuals to make meaningful choices about the use of their personal information.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368220">To make consent more meaningful and move away from lengthy agreements that, as I said, no one reads, we are introducing a new exception to consent for the collection and use of information for standard business activities that would be reasonably anticipated by individuals.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368221">Here is an example in plain language. When a customer buys something from a company and gives that company their address, the company can give that address to a delivery company so the customer can get the product they paid for.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368222">Under the law, that company would need to be transparent about how it uses personal information so that consumers are made aware of this and that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner can review these practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368223">The second element I want to talk about is the right to delete information. Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would allow Canadians to withdraw their consent and demand that data be deleted. When individuals no longer want to do business with an organization, that organization must stop using their information and must delete it permanently if it is asked by individuals. This would, for example, allow a Canadian to demand that a social media site delete their profile. It is very simple, but very powerful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368224">The next area the bill highlights is data mobility. To improve their control further, individuals would also have the right to direct and transfer their data and information from one organization or entity to another organization or entity in a very secure manner. Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would do this by enabling regulations that establish frameworks for secure transfer and interoperability. This approach would support innovation in areas like open banking, where a common technical approach could allow Canadians to take advantage of the consumer-directed financial marketplace in a more secure way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368225">Another area the bill touches on, which was highlighted through extensive consultations, is algorithmic transparency. In the area of consumer control, Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would improve transparency around the use of automated decision-making systems, such as algorithms and AI technologies, which are becoming more pervasive in the digital economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368226">Under Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, organizations must be transparent that they are using automated systems to make significant decisions or predictions about someone. It would also give individuals the right to an explanation of a prediction or decision made by these systems: How is the data collected and how is the data used?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368227">This is a brief summary of what is found in the first pillar of this legislation under more consumer control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368228">The second pillar of Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> is enabling responsible innovation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368229">The digital economy creates significant opportunities for Canadian businesses. Digital activity accounts for 4.8% of Canada's GDP, and when it comes to research and development in this country, no other private sector industry outperforms Canada's information and communications technology sector.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368230">Investment in data has climbed as high as $40 billion. Across the economy, Canadian companies' data is worth as much as all other intangible assets, such as software, research and development, and mineral exploration rights combined. Therefore, we can see the potential of data not only today, but going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368231">Globally, we are seeing unprecedented growth in the technology sector, growth that is only going to pick up as artificial intelligence continues to grow and have a more meaningful impact in our lives. According to some estimates, AI is going to contribute an additional $13.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368232">The government also understands the importance of giving companies clear rules that enable them to innovate while still protecting Canadians' privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368233">Trust is the cornerstone of economic growth and innovation. When Canadians are assured that their data and privacy are safe and protected, it creates space for the kind of innovation that benefits everyone.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368234">Our government believes that greater trust and certainty in the digital marketplace will empower small businesses and entrepreneurs to create news jobs and opportunities, expand their operations and better access the global marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368235">It is also important to note that the new legislation would help small businesses prosper as well by ensuring that rules for data and privacy are fair, clear, enforced and flexible enough to meet the needs of smaller organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368236">One area that does that is the codes of practice and certification systems. To enable responsible innovation, Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would create a framework to recognize the use of codes of practice and certification systems. This would help organizations both comply with the law and demonstrate their compliance, which, in turn, would support innovation and provide an important balance to a strengthened enforcement regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368237">Organizations would be able to apply to the Privacy Commissioner to approve a code of practice outlining how the act's general requirements apply in a particular sector or activity. This would give businesses some certainty that if they are following the code they are in compliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368238">I also want to highlight de-identified information. Bill C-11 would also clarify how organizations are to handle de-identified personal information. This would enable an important mechanism for both privacy protection and innovative uses of data, which would benefit many small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368239">Lastly is data for good. In this area, it is important to note that under the second pillar of enabling responsible innovation, Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would recognize an exception to consent for socially beneficial purposes in order to clearly allow organizations to support innovative data initiatives such as data trust, which is pursued by a range of public institutions, including hospitals, universities and libraries. There is so much potential with data trust because it can enable us to unlock some of the opportunities that exist to solve some problems across our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368240">The next element I want to talk about is strong enforcement. Perhaps more importantly, the proposal would significantly strengthen the enforcement and oversight regime. This is critical.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368241">With this proposal, we will have some of the toughest financial penalties in the world for violating our laws.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368242">Currently, the Privacy Commissioner has little ability to enforce his recommendations on organizations that are non-compliant, other than seeking a hearing by the federal court. Under Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> this would change. The legislation would introduce a strengthened privacy regime that would be overseen by a more powerful Privacy Commissioner, with appropriate checks and balances in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368243">The Office of the Privacy Commissioner would have broad order-making power, including the power to force an organization to stop collecting or using information and delete it. If the Office of the Privacy Commissioner found out that data was collected without appropriate consent, he would have the ability to do this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368244">As well, the Privacy Commissioner would make sure there is strong and meaningful consequences for organizations that do not comply with the law. The Privacy Commissioner would have the power to recommend administrative monetary penalties of up to $10 million, or 3% of global revenues, whichever is higher. The range of serious criminal offences would also be expanded, with a new maximum fine of up to $25 million, or 5% of global revenues, whichever is higher. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368245">The legislation would introduce the new personal information and data protection tribunal, which would review appeals of the commissioner's orders and levy penalties.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368246">This new administrative tribunal will help ensure procedural fairness in how the commissioner applies the new and enhanced enforcement powers. It will provide individuals and organizations with easier access to justice through a less formal mechanism for appealing decisions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368247">This enforcement regime would recognize that early compliance with the act remains critical and that is the key part. Early compliance will remain critical for the protection of Canadian privacy. We need to build on the commissioner's existing abilities to secure early resolution through compliance agreements. We want to make sure that Canadian companies actually comply with the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368248">This new regime would see stronger collaboration between the Privacy Commissioner, stakeholders and implicated institutions, including federal organizations. When the commissioner is developing that guidance, it is important to have that level of collaboration. This will ensure there is a strong alignment between the law and how it is explained and enforced, and help avoid confusion for those trying to follow it. Again, this will provide further clarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368249">To summarize, the third pillar of Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, strong enforcement and oversight, would introduce an escalating model that provides incentives for organizations to comply early. The focus is on compliance. Strong penalties will exist if they do not follow through. There will be a new tribunal to ensure the process will be fair, transparent and accessible for businesses of all sizes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368250">The three pillars of Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> work together to provide what Canadians need to engage in the digital economy: strong and enforceable protections for personal information, along with clear rules for businesses to follow as they innovate and deliver new products and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368251">It is also important to note that the legislation would help protect the privacy of Canadians, while strengthening the ability of Canadian businesses to compete globally. This positions Canada to succeed internationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368252">When PIPEDA was introduced in 2000, it was considered a global leader among data protection laws. In 2002, the European Commission found that PIPEDA provided adequate protection relative to EU law. The finding of adequacy gave us an international edge by allowing us to have free flow of data between Canadian and EU companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368253">More recently in 2018, the EU brought into force its GDPR, the general data protection regulation. Since then, the EU has been reviewing Canada's adequacy against the GDPR. They have made it clear that we must reform our privacy regimes in order to maintain our advantage when it comes to this status. I believe the legislation would achieve GDPR adequacy while maintaining the made-in-Canada approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368254">Lastly, I want to conclude by mentioning stakeholder reactions. This approach reflects years of public study, consultations and collaboration. It builds upon the fundamental work of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, as well as important deliberations in the other place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368255">I can tell members the legislation has gained support from a wide range of stakeholders. Goldy Hyder, the president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, spoke positively about this. Michael Geist, who is well recognized in this area of expertise, said this is “Canada's Biggest Privacy Overhaul in Decades”. OpenMedia calls Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> “a big win for privacy in Canada.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368256">We know that Canadians will continue to use digital services that require the use of their personal data, and we know there is no turning back.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6368257">I will conclude with this last remark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368258">As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to increase our reliance on the digital economy, Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> will help Canadians embrace this new world, knowing that their personal information is protected and safe.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> talked about data portability and open banking. Currently, in Canada the insurance arms of banking companies are not allowed to share that information with their mother company, the bank. This creates a competitive playing field for small and medium-sized insurance companies. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6368261">Madam Speaker, as I highlighted in my remarks, the legislation is good for small businesses. It would provide them the ability to work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to create codes of conduct to enable them to be compliant with the act. The tribunal process is also less expensive and onerous for small businesses, particularly when we compare it with the lengthy processes they may have had to pursue in the past in the courts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368262">More importantly, I think the legislation gives control to Canadians, particularly in the area of portability, as the member opposite highlighted, by enabling small businesses to be able to take advantage of the fact that Canadians can now move their personal data from one organization to another. That creates more competition and more choice, which will have a positive impact on small businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368282">In the connect to innovate program, the government spent a lot of money, but it did not spend a single penny in southwestern Ontario to connect businesses, residences and Canadians with the Internet in order to give them proper service. This area represents 20% of Canada's economic output. In my own area of Norfolk County, over 30% are still underserved. There is no indication of a carve-out in the new program for funding.

              <ParaText id="6368285"> If we look at the digital charter, the first principle talks about access.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6368291">Madam Speaker, today I am rising on Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, an act to implement a digital charter for government. This is an auspicious moment for Canada, because we are well under way in the digital age, and the need for clarity and concrete action to protect Canadians' privacy is a paramount need. While it is critically important, we also have to remember the need to protect small and medium-sized enterprises and to ensure that Canada can remain globally competitive as a jurisdiction for technology, data and innovation. I am concerned by some of the trends we have seen over the past few years, with Canada falling behind our global competitors, and I am concerned that some parts of this legislation could put us behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368292">I am also concerned that we are falling behind when it comes to security. It is great to talk about protecting Canadians' privacy and putting in consent-based rules, but in an age of quantum decryption and computers that can break 120-bit encryption, if our security cannot be protected, then all the consent laws and privacy protections in the world are not going to mean much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368293">I want to break down this bill into simple terms. They talk about plain language in the bill, and so I am going to try to speak in as plain a language as I can, when dealing with a matter of this technical nature. I want to talk about some of the challenges and, I will grant the government, some of the opportunities that we foresee with this legislation. I want to also thank and recognize the work of the ethics and privacy committee in the previous Parliament, under the able chairmanship of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252750" Type="2">Prince George—Peace River—Northern Rockies</Affiliation>. Many of the recommendations we have seen in this legislation come from the committee's report, so I think that shows Canadians that committees really do matter in the House, and that they can make a positive impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368294">As I said, one of my chief concerns with this bill is its impact on small and medium-sized enterprises. It has been said for a number of years that data is the new oil. For many emerging enterprises, access to data and the ability to use this data will be the determining factor in whether they are successful or not. I do not need to say, but I will, that small and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of our communities, and increasingly we are seeing how vulnerable they are, especially during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368295">We have to consider the context of this legislation within the economy and the economic structures that the Liberal government has created over the past five years. We have seen an unrelenting attack on small and medium-sized enterprises, starting with hikes to Canada pension plan premiums. These hikes will continue even this January, in the midst of a pandemic. When companies are closing their doors and laying off workers, the government is looking at increasing costs even further for employers and employees. It is just not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368296">The Liberals in the past accused business people of being tax cheats when they utilized exemptions under the tax code. They decided to take it one step further by hiking taxes and removing these exemptions for many family-owned businesses, including for a lot of businesses and farm families in my riding. With this legislation, they are adding yet another layer of red tape that will force many onerous requirements on small businesses. I recognize that many of these requirements will be very helpful when we are talking about large businesses, and they have the resources to maintain these privacy requirements. I found it interesting that the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was talking about the right to delete oneself. On many social media platforms that has been the case for a number of years, so it feels like with this legislation the government is trying to catch up to what businesses are already largely doing. However, we see that small enterprises are increasingly reliant on technology and data.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368297">In this legislation, there are a number of new requirements. There is a certification requirement and a requirement for businesses to designate somebody in their business to be the privacy watchdog. Businesses have to maintain databases and be ready to respond to customer requests or investigations. When we talk about very small businesses, which could have only two or three staff or maybe a sole proprietor, to add this new layer of red tape is really going to create a lot of challenges for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368298">Ironically, it would actually benefit big businesses because when small businesses have more red tape, they might decide to no longer stay in business. Therefore, we will see even more consolidation among the big players: the Amazons, the Walmarts and companies that are large collectors of personal data. Our thriving, innovative start-up economy will start to be strangled under this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368299">I hope that when the government is considering amendments at committee, it consults with small businesses. I encourage it to consult with the CFIB to look at the challenges small businesses are going to face, and to try to come up with some sort of threshold to ensure that small businesses are not unduly burdened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368300">I appreciate that this bill is largely targeted at major corporations and tech giants that use massive amounts of personal data for everyday business. We know that these companies have the capacity to do better in protecting our privacy. I hope that this legislation can spur further commitments to protect Canadians' privacy. However, as I said, it concerns me that these large corporations largely have already implemented a lot of the things that the government is talking about. They have the human resources, legal departments and the endless ability to tap debt markets, bond markets and stock markets to finance these changes. Frankly, small businesses do not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368301">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> a question, which he really did not answer, about data portability and the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises. The minister couches it in terms of consumers having the right to ask for their data to be moved from one organization to another. It seems like a really great thing, but I cannot think of too many situations in which a regular Canadian would be the person initiating that conversation. However, I can see where a bank would, for example, when dealing with its insurance arm. Many large Canadian banks also have insurance companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368302">There has been a fence put around these companies to ensure they do not become too big and anti-competitive. Information cannot currently be shared between insurance companies and banks owned by the same company, but through this legislation, the insurance company just needs to provide a plain-language document asking clients if they want their information to be shared with its banking arm. With the massive amount of data that insurance companies and banks have on Canadians, we can see how quickly they could possibly use this as a predatory practice to increase, consolidate and suck customers away from small and medium-sized insurance companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368303">When I drive through my riding of Sturgeon River—Parkland, I am proud to see about a dozen small and medium-sized insurance businesses for auto, home and life insurance. There are tens of thousands of Canadians employed in this important industry, and they are not all working for the big banks. I really am concerned that this legislation could make our marketplace much less competitive, so I hope the government considers that impact as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368304">My next point is about enforcement. I am really skeptical about the government's ability to deliver for Canadians. We see, in spam legislation and other legislation, that a lot of words are not being put into action and there are consequences for actions that are not being followed through on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368305">Similarly, this legislation packs a lot of firepower. It talks about threatening $10 million in fines, or up to 3% of global revenues. It is the toughest in the G7, as the government has said, but I wonder what power the government really has to compel payment. When we talk about potential serial abusers of our private data, we are talking about massive multinational corporations with billions in revenues.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368306">I wonder if we can anticipate similar challenges as those faced by France when it attempted to collect taxes on digital giants from the United States. These included a challenge at the World Trade Organization and retaliatory tariffs on French products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368307"> I wonder if the Liberals have given any thought to the potential consequences of trying to collect large fines from these companies. Does the government anticipate that our trade competitors are going to let these challenges go unanswered when we try to collect? Have the Liberals considered the consequences that this could have on the Canadian economy, and are they ready to be open about this very real threat? I am not saying that this is not something they should pursue, but we need to know what the potential consequences are before moving too quickly on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368308">Canadian innovators are at the forefront of technological advancement, and I think that is something we can all be proud of. However, a concern that has been brought to my attention is the protection of proprietary algorithms by start-up tech companies that rely on data. Some of the provisions in the bill would enforce algorithmic transparency, which sounds great for consumers, but I see that it could be used by business competitors to expose sensitive, confidential and proprietary information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368309">Has the government considered the consequence of what these actions would do to our start-up companies that want to keep their algorithms proprietary and confidential? A company may be in a situation where it is looking for a buyout at a later date and needs to build up to the point where it can really get the value it believes the company is worth, but if this algorithmic transparency could be used by its competitors to investigate the use of its algorithms, it could possibly be used to steal things that are patent-pending or as leverage in a negotiation for a buyout. I would like to see more stringent protections for our nascent technological sector, to prevent their algorithms from being exposed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368310">Next, in the bill, the minister sort of alluded to the exemption for socially beneficial purposes. We need to drill down and explore the idea. The <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> provided some examples: government, health care agencies and education. I do not think many Canadians could really object to these organizations being exempted, but one point named organizations that exist to promote environmental protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368311">We believe in strong environmental protection, but are we possibly talking about environmental charities that may have a political arm or an agenda in an election? Are they going to be exempted to use Canadians' data in any way they see fit? What potential consequences could this have on keeping our elections free from foreign influence or ensuring transparency in political communications? I would really like to get a clearer idea of what the government means when it is talking about socially beneficial purposes, because we are living in an age, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> said, when there are data wars. If organizations are misappropriating this data, using it to influence our elections and our democratic process and being provided an exemption, we really need to explore that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368312">Next I want to talk about the 10 pillars of the digital charter that the government has brought forward. We know that a charter, as any statement of values, is really only as good as the resources and enforcement behind it, so I want to highlight a few of these pillars and address some concerns that I have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368313">Pillar 1 talks about universal access: “All Canadians will have equal opportunity to participate in the digital world and the necessary tools to do so, including access, connectivity, literacy and skills.” As my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="252564" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation> was saying, too many Canadians, the fourth coast as some would say, even in relatively urban areas, say that we are far from accessing high-speed and reliable broadband services.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368314">For years, successive governments have pocketed billions and billions of dollars from spectrum auctions. They have been announcing and reannouncing, and in some cases reannouncing a reannouncement, on enhanced rural broadband. The Liberals have promised the universal broadband fund as their solution. They even claimed that they topped it up by another $750 million a few weeks ago, but communities in my riding who recently applied for the universal broadband fund were told that they did not qualify.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368315">I come from a fairly rural riding, and people were basically told that, according to the data, the Internet in their communities is fast enough. That is not acceptable. They should try explaining that to farming families in Sturgeon or Parkland County, or try telling that to people living in Stony Plain, Gibbons and Morinville. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368316">We still have movie rental stores in my riding. I asked somebody how these movie rental stores stay in business, and the fact is, the Internet is so bad, the only way for people to watch movies is to go to their local movie store because they cannot access Netflix and all these other great things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368317">We are talking about a pandemic right now, and increasingly parents are wanting to supplement their children's education at home. They cannot access their education. A principal of my local high school, Onoway Junior/Senior High School, lives less than one mile away from the high school. The high school has high-speed Internet that is connected by the Alberta SuperNet, but less than a mile away the principal cannot get any Internet services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368318">The government is saying their Internet is fast enough, and that they do not qualify for the universal broadband fund, but, if we do not qualify, then I do not know who qualifies. This is unacceptable. It is time for the Liberals to put real funds behind real action to deliver broadband access to Canadians in rural and remote areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368319">Pillar two of the digital charter is safety and security. It reads, “Canadians will be able to rely on the integrity, authenticity and security of the services they use and should feel safe online”. This is yet another great promise that the Liberals have failed to deliver upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368320"> I remember over the summer, when scammers used Canadians' personal information on the Canada Revenue Agency website to access CERB payments. These were not foreign actors we were talking about. These were private actors using information that they could get their hands on to breach Canadians' accounts, and this breach was so bad that it even forced the CRA and the Service Canada websites to shut down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368321">Thousands of Canadians who wanted to were unable to access the CERB, and all the useful services on those websites, because the government has not put security as a priority. Security must be central to digital government and to our digital economy. I appreciate that the government wanted to get those programs out quickly, but we are increasingly seeing the consequences of not building in security from the foundation up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368322">It was not just the CERB program that was hacked. In February, news broke that the National Research Council systems were hacked, mainly the health research databases. This cyber-attack was caused by ransomware. The hackers used the ransomware to try to extract payment from the government. Every year the National Research Council collects information on more than 25 million health care consumers across the U.S. and Canada. The National Research Council was also hacked in 2017 by state actors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368323">This continues to be quite a substantial threat. Hospitals and other information technology services are increasingly being targeted by these kinds of crimes. Since 2016, according to a cyber-threat assessment, there have been 172 attacks on individual health care organizations with costs topping $160 million. Those are just the attacks that are known about. It causes one to wonder how many attacks have not even been discovered yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368324">It gets worse. Despite the multiple data breaches, the protection on critical infrastructure plan has not been updated in this country since 2009, despite major technological advancements. I alluded earlier to the Manhattan project of data decryption and quantum computing, which we are seeing out of countries like China. They threaten to blow open all of our current encryption technologies. It shows us that the plan is even more critical.</ParaText>

I have a story from my riding: A couple come to me who had used a third party tax service to apply for their CERB money. The tax service charged them $300 per CERB application, which is absolutely absurd when someone can just go to the CRA website and click a few buttons to access the money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368336">It just goes to show that sometimes when the government constructs something and does not think through all of the angles while trying to get the money out the door, there are people who will be hurt by that legislation. When I raised that to the government, its response was that it is not illegal. That is not acceptable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368339">Madam Speaker, there is a provision in the bill that says a small business has to designate a specific person responsible for maintaining these privacy databases. When we are talking about a small business with just a few employees, oftentimes a sole proprietor may be running the books, sales or the website, and they are now being told that they have to also be the designated privacy CO of their company. That is adding red tape for a small business. For a big business, it is not that big, as it probably already has those positions laid out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368340">Small businesses trying to maintain those databases and having the ability to keep all the data they are collecting, so as to be ready to comply with requests from the consumer and Privacy Commissioner to hand over the data at any time, creates a ton of paperwork for small businesses. We need to look at a better way to do this to ensure that we can protect the privacy of Canadians, but not put too many onerous requirements on small businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368354">I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge my colleagues who have been with me from the beginning of the first session of the 43rd Parliament. We immediately started looking into the matter of privacy breaches and fraud. The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology unanimously agreed to take into account the previous work done to study what action we should urgently take to prevent the kind of situation we are in now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368355">I salute my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, and I also want to point out that I very much look forward to studying this bill in committee. We had already unanimously adopted a motion to study privacy matters, and today a bill has been introduced. We spent a long time in committee looking into conflicts of interest. I had 40 hours, during which it was difficult to vote on a motion in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368356">That being said, prorogation did not do us any good. If Parliament had not been prorogued, we would not be where we are today. We would already be at the forefront when it comes to protecting our people from fraud and identity theft. I know that this happened to some people who work for the House of Commons. This is a complex and troubling issue. As the Privacy Commissioner said, the accounts of no less than 30 million out of 37 million Canadians were affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368357">I would like to tell everyone here and the people watching us at home that their personal information was used. We are talking about a privacy breach.

              <ParaText id="6368363">I provided a brief overview of this issue because safeguards have already been implemented in over 30 countries. Our friends in the European Union have been taking the bull by the horns since 2016, and I think we should follow their example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368364">I applaud the introduction of this bill. It was about time. I would also like to talk about a few things that I look forward to studying as soon as possible at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368365">It was proposed that the commissioner be given additional powers. This bill proves that this proposal was taken into account. The commissioner will be able to impose major penalties. Currently, as all those who grabbed the bull by the horns know full well, businesses are responsible for protecting personal information or face penalties, which vary from one country to another. This bill introduces a 3% penalty, which means businesses such as Facebook, a company worth several billion, could pay up to $10 million if they do not properly protect personal information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368366">I am also very happy with another part of this bill, which came up earlier, about consent to use and transfer our data. Businesses and organizations that have our data must always have our consent. That is crucial, and I am happy about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368367">Once again, I congratulate the government on giving the commissioner the power to issue orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368368">However, there is one thing I am very concerned about, and it has to do with organizations such as banks that are under federal jurisdiction. I think that if there is one organization that should lead by example and demonstrate that it is protecting data and working to prevent fraud, it should be the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368369">The first time I read the bill, I did not see anything about the government fulfilling its obligations. My hon. colleague talked about this earlier. Many people in Laurentides—Labelle have told me they are worried about finding out at tax time that someone claimed CERB using their name. People have even told me they tested it. They applied, and their application was approved. These are people who are receiving employment insurance benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368370">There are also those who, upon opening their account, discovered that they were victims of fraud. These people have followed up and filed a complaint. Unfortunately, it takes a long time for them to hear back, and some people never hear back. I feel that this bill should also include a requirement to support those who have been victims of fraud and help them through the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368371">Right now, it is about prevention and punishment. Let me explain prevention, which is very simple. Prevention is making sure all the necessary elements are in place to validate a person's identity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368372">However, this bill does not propose a complete reform of the ID authentication processes for individuals through organizations or the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368373">Several countries have already taken action and instituted two ID authentication processes. The first involves confirming what the person knows. However, if an individual's personal information is known and their data are open, anyone can immediately commit fraud using their name.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368374">The second involves confirming what the person has using various tools. Some apps already use text message authentication, for example. Sometimes the person has to place a call from their home. This is another important authentication process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368375">Several countries use other authentication processes based on even more personal information, such as voice recognition or fingerprints. Close attention will have to be paid to facial authentication to ensure that all rules are followed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368376">I look forward to taking part in the committee deliberations. I welcome this bill, but it needs to be amended properly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368383">Madam Speaker, since there are no other questions and comments, I believe that shows that my colleague was very clear. I will try to be clear as well. The bar is high, but I will try to meet it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368384">Generally speaking, as my colleague said, this bill represents a step forward and addresses several of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada's requests. Quebeckers were profoundly shocked by the Desjardins data breach. It was a very significant event. However, it was not the only one. Similar incidents occurred in 2017 and 2018, and there have probably been dozens more that we are not aware of. In fact, when a bank's data is stolen, the bank is required to inform the police and the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, but it is not required to inform the public or even its customers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368385">We like this bill because it sets out a series of principles relating to the collection and sharing of personal information by companies: free and informed consent for the collection and use of data; the ability to allow or deny the transfer of data to another company, such as between two financial institutions; the ability to withdraw consent or request that data be deleted; transparency about the use of algorithms that use personal data; and stricter criteria for the use of de-identified data. This bill also gives real powers to Canada's Privacy Commissioner, sets out significant penalties for non-compliance, and creates the personal information and data protection tribunal. All of that is great.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368386">Unfortunately, the problem is that the bill omits one extremely important element, and that is protecting people's identity online to prevent fraud due to identity theft, especially during financial transactions. We know that Europe has brought in a whole suite of regulations to force financial institutions to verify a person's identity before authorizing a transaction. There is nothing like that in Canada, and this bill does not have anything of the kind either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368387">The federal government is not properly verifying individuals' identity before authorizing electronic transactions. We know that the challenge is to prevent data from being stolen and used to commit fraud. Having personal data stolen is unpleasant enough, so all measures must be taken to ensure that the data are not then used for fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368388">The debate in Ottawa over the massive data breach at Desjardins mainly revolved around social insurance numbers. We know that several people would like to change their social insurance numbers, but under the current system, they cannot do so unless they become a victim of fraud resulting from identity theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368389">In addition, the federal government has received a number of requests to redesign the social insurance card to make it harder to counterfeit, similar to what Ottawa did with passports after the September 11, 2001, attacks, at the request of the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368390">These two requests are perfectly reasonable. The Bloc fully agrees and is asking Ottawa to follow up. However, that alone will not stop fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368391">The best way to prevent identity theft is to make sure that the person who is making the transaction is indeed who they claim to be. This goes without saying. There are three ways to verify a person's identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368392">First, a person can be identified based on what they know, namely personal information such as their name, address or social insurance number. However, as cases of identity theft are on the rise, it is getting harder and harder to accurately identify someone. In other words, our private information is no longer private when everyone can find out almost everything about us. Fraudsters can simply use this information to create a fake ID, and they are set.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368393">Second, a person can be identified based on what they have, such as their computer's IP address, which the institution can recognize if the transaction is being conducted from the person's home, or their cellphone, to which the institution can send a secret code via text message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368394">Third, a person can be identified based on who they are. The institution can use technologies that recognize a person's physical characteristics, such as their voice, their facial features, through the use of facial recognition, their digital fingerprints, which are increasingly being used by cellphones, or their handwritten signature.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368395">Europe adopted regulations in 2016 requiring financial institutions to use at least two of these three ways to identify someone before authorizing a transaction. Banks in Canada are under no such obligation. If they believe that the control mechanisms will cost more than the losses they are currently incurring in fraud, they are better off doing nothing. The banks will not pay for controls that would be more costly than the fraud. That is simply profit-driven logic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368396">Many members have probably had the experience of having a store issue a credit card on the spot, based solely on the personal information we provide. We just have to give our phone number, address, and so on, and that is all it takes. This practice really opens the door to fraud, and it has to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368397">We believe that the banks must be forced to tackle fraud. That is the solution that we are advocating. We are going to propose possible approaches. As my colleague was saying, we are going to support the bill, but we will be bringing forward amendments. We will have concrete, constructive and coherent proposals when the time comes to study the bill in detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368398">We will propose ways to combat identity theft, such as by drawing on the European regulations I was talking about, in order to force the banks to bring in robust processes to verify people’s identity before authorizing a financial transaction. We will also propose to increase fines in order to encourage banks to better protect their customers’ personal information. We will propose that banks be required to submit a detailed report, as part of their annual reporting, on the number of identity thefts and the resulting losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368399">We will also propose a requirement to contact any person whose identity has been fraudulently used within the organization, regardless of whether an account was opened or not. As I said earlier, there is no such obligation in place and it must be brought in. There is also an obligation to cover the costs paid by victims to recover their identity. These costs must be covered by the banks, which are rolling in a lot more money than individuals and most of their customers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368400">There also need to be anonymous tip lines for employees who are aware of unreported identity theft, as well as protection for whistleblowers. There is currently a void when it comes to whistleblower protection, as in virtually all areas. I am getting a little off topic, but the House will have to deal with this issue as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368401">Ottawa also has to look in its own backyard. Beyond the banks, the same anti-fraud controls need to be imposed on the federal government itself. Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> applies only to private businesses. It does not apply to the federal government. Currently, Ottawa’s online identity controls are clearly inadequate. Before authorizing a transaction, the government does not take all the necessary steps to ensure that a claimant is who they say they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368402">Since last spring, there have been numerous cases of identity theft. These include Canada emergency response benefit claims made in other people’s names and tax refunds being redirected to other accounts. Some people will not find out that they have been victims of identity theft until they file their income tax returns. It has not yet happened yet, but it will soon. In a few months, many people will discover that they have been victims of fraud. Right now, they have no idea. This is absurd, and it is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368403">Again this fall, thousands of taxpayers lost access to their Service Canada account, which prevented them from applying for employment insurance even though they lost their jobs because their region was going back into the red zone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368404">It is all well and good to introduce a bill on the management of personal data by private companies. I want to stress that we agree on this bill and that we will vote in favour of it. That part is settled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368405">However, Ottawa needs to clean up its own backyard as soon as possible and take immediate action to combat identity theft. We are saying yes to regulating private businesses, but we are also saying yes to regulating Ottawa and the banking industry.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6368427">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate from my office in this important debate on Canadian privacy. The bill would enact the consumer privacy protection act and the personal information and data protection tribunal act. It would also make consequential amendments to other acts. We are debating a fairly complicated subject, but one that has been warranted for many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368428">The New Democrats have been calling for a modernization of our privacy laws and our consumer protection laws for about a decade. Most recently, our efforts have resulted in a digital bill of rights' discussion across Canada in which we have been at the forefront and have pushed hard to have some of these rights discussed, not only in the public forum but also in the chambers of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368429">We have witnessed the world move on. We have seen the Privacy Commissioner identify Canada as backwater when it comes to protecting privacy and the capabilities of the modern world. With COVID-19, we see further online activity among Canadians and further vulnerabilities for not only individuals but for our families, schools, businesses and even Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368430">The New Democrats have a different position from other political parties. We believe that people's human rights are connected to their digital rights. People's online presence and the digital footprint they leave in the wake of the business they have to do is just as important as their physically enshrined rights as a human being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368431"> When we look at what is taking place, even with COVID, and the ability of people to participate online, we have seen the failings of two decades of Liberals and Conservatives to connect Canadians, all the way from Maxime Bernier's program, launched as a Conservative minister, to most recently where we are struggling and scrambling to get Canadians connected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368432">One of the other things the New Democrats talk about is the affordability of participating in this democracy and not only with respect to one's participation on a regular social basis. As governments have moved more and more services away from brick and mortar to online, we have seen the exposure of Canadian privacy. We have seen that even within government resources, everything from social insurance numbers to other types of breaches that have taken place. We have seen this in the private sector as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368433">Canada has often lagged in the private sector, not only in oversight but also in the punishment of those who take advantage of people in the new digital age. In our digital bill of rights, which we presented more than two years ago, we talked about not only personal data being protected, but also how people were being manipulated through the services provided online. For years and years our philosophy has been net neutrality. I will highlight a few new problems with the bill which could derail that type of philosophy and could stream Canadians to more vulnerabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368434">There are all kinds of examples of how Canadians have been abused. Whether it be Yahoo, Ticketmaster, Marriott or Equifax, the list goes on and on. Most recently, a heightened example of this, which created a lot of attention across the world, was Facebook and the outright manipulation of people's personal data. People were being used as pawns without even knowing what their rights were or being protected from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368435">Again, Canada's laws do not allow our Privacy Commissioner to come down hard on some of these giants. Governments in the past have been too close with the web giants and have not allowed Canadians to have the proper recourse when data breaches have taken place.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368436">The personal information and data production tribunal act being proposed by the government would create a number of potential false promises for accountability. It has a low threshold of involvement of those who would be appointed to the tribunal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368437">First, we have to get past the notion that these types of political appointments will be free and clear of all political and business-type leverages to select the tribunal. Second, we have to assume the tribunal can be fair, quick and just in its cases. Third, baked-in problems with regard to the role of the tribunal create some concerns. The first is that the tribunal could overturn the Privacy Commissioner in many respects and it would go to a judicial process, which could take years and years to settle cases that may no longer be relevant to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368438">There is also a low threshold for the inclusion of some of the appointments. There is no requirement for a Superior Court judge and only one judge is allowed in maybe a one-to-three-member panel or a one-to-six-member panel. These things need to be fixed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368439">Something I want to further explore is more powers for the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner has been very clear in asking for more resources and supports over the last number of years to deal with privacy breaches that have occurred and also to bring in more accountability. It is in our business interests, not only our interests as individuals, families and all of the institutions but in business interests, to have a clear process so the bad actors in this environment that are doing harm to Canadians and other businesses are not rewarded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368440">One thing I am most proud of accomplishing as a member of Parliament was ending the tax deductibility of corporate fines and penalties. That was about 15 years ago. In the past, if a business was caught doing something illegal, it was able to write off part of the government fine as a business-related expense. I was able to champion a change to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368441"> Businesses that were doing illegal activity and influencing competition were using it as a loss leader. They would essentially get millions of dollars in fines and penalties, everything from drug companies to those getting environmental fines and penalties, and they would apply for that money back at tax time. It was a way for them to undercut the competition that was doing the right thing. That is what I am concerned about with the tribunal. It would have the capability to influence market stability to some degree with regard to penalties and fines for the bad actors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368442">If it does not work right, if it is not seen as credible and if it does not flow the way it should, it can be an encouragement for some of those committing the breaches to be sloppy with personal information, disrespectful and also manipulative in taking information from Canadians, steering them to different purchases and activities, exposing them and then beating some of the competition. For some young entrepreneurs who have to go up against some of these established giants, it is very difficult for them to get a toehold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368443">A number of factors are in place, even in our general market economy, for young people and entrepreneurs to get busy and to compete. One most recently was in the retail sector. Businesses are being charged extra to get floor space in the real world. Amazon and other players have also used manipulative practices to steer consumers to particular products and services from preferred customers. That defeats our philosophy of net neutrality. It could also direct people and their families to making purchases or viewing activity with the time they have into different market conditions as opposed to exploring in a free and open Internet society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368444">Another thing is that Canadian federal political parties are exempt from oversight. We do not understand why the Liberals would allow this to take place. It should be clear and proper that their data and personal information be open and accountable in political parties as well. We will be looking at amendments to this activity because we strongly believe they should be accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368445">To bring faith and accountability to our democracy requires transparency. We have seen the sensationalism that has taken place in political advertising in the last number of campaigns and the favouritism that has been seen online. We have also seen the giant data assembly that has taken place which can manipulate voting and steer people to different discussion points.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368446">The personal privacy information collected by political parties should also be clear. This way there will be more faith in the information that political parties get. More important, our democracy will be strengthened by privacy protection, not weakened or exempted with regard to the model being presented by the government right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368447">We also want to be more technical and continue to have commercial activity defined under PIPEDA. This is more related to the business section aspect for fair and open transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368448">We want to deal with a particular issue in regard to algorithmic transparency. Algorithms can help direct purchasing and activity and can also manipulate someone. It will just get stronger because artificial intelligence is being introduced more and more into society in regard to all our products and services. This includes search engine searches, the types of purchases made with different corporations and a number of different activities that take place. It is important there be accountability and oversight for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368449">A number of different things have been going on with regard to Canadians and their privacy. There is no doubt there will be more challenges with this bill. We want to go back to a number of different structures that take place with respect to this. Again, the New Democrats championed a digital bill of rights for many years. I want to highlight a few important things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368450">If we cannot have a fair, open and just society with regard to our digital footprint, we believe our democracy is threatened, our economy is threatened and, more important, investments into this country will be threatened. We will not have the same oversight that Europe or the United States have. That is very important to ensure that investment in Canada will take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368451">It is important to note that if we are working toward things like access to telecommunication services all across Canada and we are investing in this, we need to think about the billions of dollars already spent on this, along with the additional money to be spent. We want this to be done right and proper, especially with COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368452">Over the years, as we have gone to more online services and invested in this, we have had opportunities. When we think about how we use this space for ourselves, whether it be commercial activity, entertainment or business, we sell off the spectrum. The spectrum is the infrastructure we can use. It is above us. It is the radio and capacity to move, most recently, the 5G network. We will see a spectrum auction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368453"> In the past 20 years, $22 billion of revenue has come into the public coffers with spectrum auctions. We have seen a patchwork of activity take place all across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368454">I previously mentioned Maxime Bernier, with the Conservatives, and most recently the Liberals. Several plans have emerged that are more a hodgepodge of applications. It is one program after another that is sought out. They are also providing massive subsidizations for those markets, which costs billions of dollars. Even the CRTC has a fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368455">I can list a series of them, but the point is that if we are going through all this trouble and investment to create a society space for our digital world and economy and we are heavily investing in this, then we need to do it right, especially with a geography like Canada, which is so large. This can be a challenge, but given our population size and the fact that we have dense populations along the border and other places, we can turn this into an advantage for business investment as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368456">The New Democrats believe this is part of our human right with respect to how people are treated online. This includes accountability from companies with regard to cyberbullying, privacy protection, speeds and affordability. They are combined. If we do not have this type of approach as a philosophical one, we leave ourselves open to having more winners than losers. It would be no different than having lost education opportunities for people and a requirement for the government to come in and do the right thing, which is to make things more affordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368457">I mentioned the concentration of our population. It is important we tie this into the bill as we finally expand to rural and remote locations, and the security and accountability for that information.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368458">We have talked a lot about preserving different cultures and providing business opportunities for areas that have been weakened because of their geography or lack of connectivity to large populations, but if we do not put a rules-based system in place that allows them to compete fairly, then they will fall to the wayside. Specifically, we could have a number of opportunities for smaller businesses to evolve, some scale-ups to take place, communities that could actually have some empowerment in getting to new markets and keeping the community stronger and together, but if it is not done in a way to have online privacy protection and so that businesses can compete in a fair way, then it is going to be lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368459">One of the concerns we have in general, not only with regards to ourselves as a country but also the rest of the world with some of the web giants, is the consolidation of services and how online services are used. In Canada, our competition has not been the strongest at some points, but there is an opportunity as we do this, which is why this legislation is so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368460">With the spectrum auction coming up, New Democrats have argued that charging as much money as we can to the telcos coming in and then seeing how things go results in what we have right now: less competition and higher prices, and prices that, quite frankly, limit people's participation in the digital world. This is a concern that we have, and so we have suggested to turn the spectrum auction around, like many other countries have done, and use it as a way to connect at lower costs by putting out expectations, such as an RFP-type model. When the bidding comes in, we may get a little less money coming in the front door, but the expectations are going to be higher and the requirements to connect rural or remote communities will be there. The telcos will use it or lose it. That is one of the things we believe could be a real benefit to move along the different programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368461">Basically, what we have now is a series of programs out there where communities almost have to go on bended knee to get access, to get support to actually lower the price points to make things more competitive and attractive. Our model would have a reverse role. The business community would already have the expectation that the spectrum is less, but the time frame to connect Canadians is high, with the expectation that they use it or lose it, for those things to happen relatively quickly. In fact, industry has indicated that the NDP plan could take place and connect Canada within four years: 98% in three years and the last little part in the last year, because it is more difficult in some locations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368462">This is important and critical, because this potential law would lay out the framework on how that activity takes place. It is one of the reasons we believe this tribunal is one of the more interesting curiosities, and there are other things to talk about regarding that. However, if we spend all of this money, time and public policy and then do not get it right, we would have a weak and irresponsible approach to oversight in making sure that Canada does not have problems with regards to this. It is already going to create a skew in the public policy laws that we have. I fear that the bill, in its current form, if it does not sharpen up on those points, would create a skewed market for some years to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368463">Parliament most likely will not deal with this again any time soon. It has taken far too long to get to this point. We have to get this through a minority Parliament, we have to get it through the Senate and we have to get it signed off by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> at the end of the day. That is going to take some time and commitment, which we have with the New Democrats. We want to improve the bill, we want to make sure that it is stronger, but if we do not get these points right, we are going to undermine things. This is why, when we think about how important this is with our current public policy and our resources, everybody out there has been concerned about COVID-19 and the effects upon the broadband and the experience for education, involvement and commitment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368464">To conclude, the difference for New Democrats is that we believe that our human rights and digital rights are enshrined just as our physical rights. As we move to this type of engagement, as we see hybrids take place within workplaces, schools and other types of activity, this bill is a step forward, but it needs to be strengthened, and we can be counted on to do that. It is our intent to make Parliament work, but, more importantly, to make sure that we have laws that are going to work to protect Canadians. </ParaText>

As we are expanding into rural and remote Canada, we want to make sure there is even more confidence for the personal protection of privacy. Also, there is a bit of cultural change. So many of us in urban centres who have had access to high-speed Internet and other types of services have been used to some of that abuse, whereas we want to put in protections for small and medium-sized enterprises. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368489">The incredible scale of data collection can be a powerful force, both for good and bad, so we need strong privacy and digital rights and a strong regulator to enforce them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368490">There is much in our government's Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, which is a serious reform of PIPEDA and certainly long overdue. I remember in June 2018, I introduced legislation simply to give the Privacy Commissioner new powers, which our privacy committee had twice unanimously recommended. We have come a long way since then with this substantive bill. OpenMedia said, “Bill C-11 is a big win for privacy in Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368491">While I have heard some reflections from experts and certainly from some parliamentary colleagues already about how the bill can potentially be improved, or some open questions about what might need to be fixed, it is certainly deserving of our support at second reading. I look forward to working with colleagues across party lines to improve the legislation at committee where we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368492">At this point, to work at committee across party lines something of a detour is required. I want to specifically commend my Conservative Party colleagues from <Affiliation DbId="252893" Type="2">Prince George</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="252919" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>, my NDP colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> and my Liberal colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252911" Type="2">Kitchener Centre</Affiliation>. We worked very long and hard on privacy issues in the last Parliament. We helped found the International Grand Committee, comprised of over 10 countries, to discuss these issues. We hosted the second meeting of the IGC in Ottawa. We tabled the report “Towards Privacy by Design” in February of 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368493">When we as parliamentarians talk about committee work and often the overlooked nature of the committee work, we do not always see that committee work turn into legislation. In this instance we have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368494">We recommended stronger consent rules and we see stronger rules in Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>. We recommended algorithmic transparency and we see in Bill C-11 a commitment on transparency where systems are used to make predictions, recommendations or decisions about consumers. We recommended data portability and interoperability. We see those commitments in Bill C-11.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368495">We see stronger powers for the Privacy Commissioner. I mentioned that need for a strong regulator, including order-making, auditing and the ability to levy fines. We see order-making powers. We see the ability to audit. We see a new tribunal, and while I understand some of the caution or questions members are raising in respect of this design, it is consistent with the competition commissioner and tribunal operations and worth looking at more seriously to see if it can be approved. However, through the tribunal, we see the ability to levy significant fines, in the magnitude of $10 million to a maximum of $25 million for more serious fines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368496">In terms of the course of that committee work, I want to reflect on a couple of stories about why this kind of legislation is so important and critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368497">I think it was in the fall of 2017, when we were in the midst of the study on PIPEDA reform, that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252919" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>, the former member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley, I believe I am getting that right, and I went down to Washington and met with other elected representatives there. We witnessed some of the hearings in relation to the Equifax breach, but we also met with Facebook officials. At that time, when a question was put by I think the member for <Affiliation DbId="252919" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> as to what Facebook's views were on the potential new regulations, they said absolutely no new regulations were required in Canada due to the strong framework through PIPEDA and, if there were new rules, that might affect Facebook's willingness and interest in investing in Canada. Certainly, we have come a long way since those kinds of conversations and push-back by big tech companies against stronger privacy rules.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368498">We saw that Mark Zuckerberg unfortunately did not attend before the IGC, though he said he would like to work with parliamentarians around the world, but we can certainly say that the days of self-regulation are over and asking for regulation. Here is that kind of regulation in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368499">On consent, I have to tell one other story that happened at committee. Again, we had Facebook officials there. We were in the midst of going down the rabbit hole of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the Canadian context of that third-party app, which had shared so much information. I think it was under 300 Canadians who had used the app, but thousands of Canadians had their information shared. I put to Facebook at the time, “How is it that on the basis of meaningful consent thousands of Canadians could have agreed that their friends share their information through this third-party app and then share it with Cambridge Analytica?” With a straight face somehow, a Facebook representative said to me that it was in their terms and conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368500">That speaks to the problematic nature of consent in the existing law and the lack of meaningful consent. Thankfully, our Privacy Commissioner, despite his current lack of meaningful powers, pursued that line of inquiry and found that Facebook violated our current laws and took the matter to court. We know that with stronger consent rules, there would have been no ability for a Facebook representative to say with a straight face that there was meaningful consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368501">Plain language is important. I would go further, though, and say that as we think about consent, particularly in a consumer context, I think we ought to be more wary of privacy by default. We have to be more concerned about privacy by default. Where there is a reasonable expectation of the consumer that information is going to be shared and used in a particular way, then explicit consent, obviously, ought not need to be required, but where there are secondary uses, where there are uses beyond a reasonable expectation of that consumer then, certainly, we need explicit opt-in consent. It needs to be very clear to consumers how their information is to be used, if at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368502">I want to emphasize the consumer context because it is a curiosity of privacy legislation and a curiosity of consumer protection legislation that when I purchase my phone I do not have to read the terms and conditions. There is no expectation by government that I read the terms and conditions, yet I am protected. There are implied warranties pursuant to consumer protection legislation. I do not need to read those terms and conditions in order for my rights to be protected as a consumer, yet there is an expectation when I download any app on my phone that I read the terms and conditions. That cannot be a tenable state of affairs if we want to protect consumers. We cannot expect consumers to read every term and condition, and every consumer contract in the course of downloading applications, and in the course of living their lives, as I said, increasingly online. Our laws need to reflect that reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368503">There are obviously some straightforward fixes for this legislation. The membership of the tribunal should obviously have greater privacy expertise. I think that is a no-brainer. We do have to think more deeply through some of these consent rules and how we can strengthen them potentially further. I would like to see us go beyond algorithmic explainability to some kind of algorithmic accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368504"> I know that others have mentioned political parties being left out. I do not know that political parties need to be subject to PIPEDA specifically, but they ought to be subject to privacy legislation. If there is no further effort under way by the government, then I think PIPEDA may well be the place to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368505">Lastly, I think we have to focus on children, in particular, when we look at consent rules and protecting kids on the Internet. Previously, I have written and spoken publicly about my support for our right to be forgotten, but I do think we have to be more focused on our rules and protection for kids as they grow up with the Internet and live their entire lives online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368506">I will close by simply saying that this is a big bill. This is second reading and, certainly, all of us ought to support this in principle. I look forward to working with experts and colleagues to strengthen the bill at committee and get into the details.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368509">Mr. Speaker, I would say a few things. First, the concept of proportionality is really important in this regard. Second, it is a live concern that should be addressed by the committee in some respect, but I would also note and would present some caution in response that there are some small companies that collect mountains of personal information. It is not necessarily the size of the company but the activities of the company that we ought to be most concerned about.</ParaText>

I felt I should have written it with him at some points, because we spent so much time together studying this and pushing the government for action. There are some key elements in this legislation that certainly come from our work together on the ethics committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368511">I am interested in the issue of algorithmic accountability. I think that is something the ethics committee was way out front on. When I look at the other legislation, about having Facebook and Google under the CRTC, I feel it was the best idea for the 1990s. When we are dealing with algorithmic powers that are pushing extremist content, that are pushing Holocaust denial, and when we have seen how that is the real driver on the big social media platforms, and the inability of parliamentarians to actually look inside that black box, I would like to ask my hon. colleague how he would suggest we actually get some stronger accountability mechanisms on the algorithms that are pushing the content and driving people to certain sites and certain conversations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368513">When we look at the use of algorithms and the use of algorithms combined with just the scale of data collection that we see today, we can narrowly focus in on consumer privacy on the one hand, but on the other hand there are bigger conversations about how that information is used to target messages to us and the implications for our democracy. There is a reason, when we hosted that meeting in Ottawa for the IGC, that it was on big data, privacy and democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368514">In terms of algorithmic accountability specifically, I would say I am not certain yet what the perfect solution looks like, but I have always been interested in the work of the Treasury Board in respect of algorithmic impact assessments. It is clear enough, and I am glad to see in Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> that there is a commitment to algorithmic transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368515">Going further and having some body, potentially the Privacy Commissioner, able to look under the hood and audit algorithms and their potential positive and negative impacts is important. We need to figure out a way to do just that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6368520">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in speaking to the digital charter implementation act, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368521"> In today's ever-changing digital environment, Canadians have demanded better protection of their personal information. They have also demanded that organizations be held accountable for misusing their information. Stakeholders have told us that they want flexibility to innovate responsibly and want consistency with privacy rules everywhere else in other jurisdictions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368522">I am proud to say that the digital charter implementation act, which would enact the consumer privacy protection act, or CPPA, represents the most ambitious overhaul of Canada's private sector privacy regime since PIPEDA was first introduced, in 2000. CPPA would introduce significant changes to better protect the personal information of Canadians in the way they have been demanding, including, of course, with strong financial consequences for those who do not follow the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368523">Prior to PIPEDA, in the 1990s, other countries around the globe introduced new laws to ensure that privacy was protected and that the opportunities afforded by e-commerce and the flow of information around the globe flourished. In particular, the EU introduced a privacy directive for its member countries to implement into their national laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368524">Inspired by the EU law, Quebec introduced the first private sector privacy law in Canada in 1994. This was an important step forward, but it also raised the potential and, of course, the prospect for a patchwork of provincial privacy laws. With the prospect of multiple, possibly conflicting, rules and gaps in privacy protection that could harm Canadians, the federal government needed to act. Canada required a national privacy standard to ensure consumer confidence and regulatory certainty for businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368525">At the outset of the new millennium, PIPEDA was created to address the privacy concerns arising from a period of technological disruption fuelled by the rise of the Internet. It provided a framework with robust privacy protections and the flexibility to support the legitimate needs of businesses to use personal information. It also provided a mechanism by which the provincial private sector privacy laws could be considered substantially similar. This meant that where such a law is accorded that designation, PIPEDA does not apply to an organization's activities within a province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368526">In 2004, Alberta and British Columbia passed private sector privacy laws that are considered substantially similar, as is Quebec's law. A number of newer provincial health information laws have also passed, since 2005, that have been appropriately designated as substantially similar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368527">PIPEDA would continue, however, to apply to the federally regulated sector in a province and to any personal information collected, used or disclosed in the course of commercial activities across provincial borders. This provided a stable regulatory environment and flexibility for the provinces, and supported Canada's trade interests for many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368528">However, today we are faced with a changed environment. Today, in many ways, history is repeating itself, but the risks have evolved. The role of digital technologies is considerably more central to our lives than it was 20 years ago. Just consider our experience in recent months with the pandemic. To harness all that the modern digital world has to offer, we clearly needed to modernize our federal private sector privacy law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368529">In a globally connected economy, our laws needed to be consistent with those of other jurisdictions. Internationally agreed privacy rules, such as the OECD privacy guidelines, first introduced in 1980, were updated in 2013. So too, I might add, more recently, was the APEC privacy framework. Indeed, privacy laws based on these international norms have been changing and advancing in Europe, Japan, South America and New Zealand.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368530">What have these changes entailed? Core privacy principles have remained, though some have been expanded, such as accountability and breach reporting. New elements, such as enhancing rights of erasure and mobility rights, a greater emphasis on transparency, more certainty for businesses and consumers through codes certification and stronger consequences for non-compliance, have been the principal hallmarks of many of these evolving changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368531">Closer to home, this summer, Quebec introduced amendments to its private sector privacy law, and B.C. recently conducted a study on its own laws. Ontario too is considering introducing a new private sector privacy law. Stakeholders have told us they are worried about the burden of multiple laws with different requirements. They demanded harmonization here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368532"> There is a clear need for the progress and reforms included in the digital charter implementation act, 2020. If we do not act, there is a risk of further fragmentation of privacy rules across the country. We need to keep up with changing technology and business practices, and incorporate the best international practices, protocols and safeguards in our own domestic laws. We also need to set a common standard for privacy protection for the private sector across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368533">Like the current PIPEDA, the new CPPA would be grounded in the federal trade and commerce powers. It recognizes the very importance of doing business on a national basis and in an economy that must work across provincial boundaries. Also, like PIPEDA, it would provide for a mechanism to recognize provincial laws that are substantially similar. These regulations would set out the criteria and process for such recognition or for reconsideration of it, and would continue to provide the provincial flexibility that has been important to PIPEDA's success. CPPA, like its predecessor, would maintain the Privacy Commissioner's ability to collaborate and co-operate with his or her provincial counterparts, an important tool to ensure consistency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368534"> As the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> emphasized earlier today, the focus should always be on compliance. Some ask why we cannot have just one national law. The answer, of course, is that Canada is a federation; there is a division of powers. Indeed, the provinces provide important coverage that a national law cannot, under our Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368535">I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge the international context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368536">We live in an interconnected world. Data are constantly flowing across borders. In 2002, the European Commission recognized PIPEDA as providing adequate protection relative to EU law, allowing for the free flow of personal information between Canadian and European businesses. However, in 2018, a new EU regulation came into effect: the General Data Protection Regulation. It updated many of the existing requirements and added strong financial penalties for contraventions. The EU is currently reviewing its existing adequacy decisions, including the one applying to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368537">That is why the government launched Canada's digital charter in 2019. Its 10 guiding principles offer a firm foundation on which to build an innovative and inclusive digital and data economy. The principles of ensuring interoperability, a level playing field, strong enforcement and real accountability are clearly reflected in the digital charter implementation act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368538">I want to thank members for their attention today, and I can assure them that our approach to privacy protection respects the privacy rights of Canadians. It is pragmatic, principled, meets our trading needs and provides a consistent, coherent framework that Canadians and stakeholders can rely on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368539">With Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, we will continue to encourage trade and investment and grow an economy that extends across provincial and international borders alike.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368551">Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to rise again today to address Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>. This bill, when printed, is nearly an inch thick. It is a monster bill for around here. It is a timely bill, as well. I am looking forward to delving into it. I have not had the opportunity to read through it in great detail to this point, but I want to speak to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368552">This is a top-of-mind issue for many Canadians. One of the things I want to point out right off the top is that when someone is online and a virtual persona, if they think they are getting a free product, they are actually the product. That is the thing to remember and many folks do not seem to realize that. That is something I have not seen in this bill, which is important. I think it is missing from this bill, although this bill may not be seeking to address that specifically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368553">There could be some sort of public awareness campaign, much the same as we have done with cigarettes. In the past, the public was trained that if someone smoked cigarettes, they would get cancer. We could do this for online profiles and show the dangers and what is going on out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368554">As well, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253135" Type="2">Port Moody—Coquitlam</Affiliation> mentioned what is actually happening with our data. We think we are filling out a fun game or personality test, but we are actually giving away data. It can be harvested commercially to send advertisements and promote certain products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368555">We continue to see more invasion of our privacy. I do not know about other members, but the thing that jumped out at me, during my first cursory read of this bill, was the term “algorithm transparency”. That is something I am really fascinated by.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368556">On the weekend, my friend was telling me that he took his phone, laid it on the table and he and his friends talked about white rabbits for three to four minutes. They just said the words “white rabbits” often. Then they opened up his phone, went to Facebook and the advertisements he was getting were about white rabbits. Our phones are listening to us and there are algorithms that are promoting certain things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368557">We can probably turn that feature off and mute the microphones on our phones all the time if we know how to do that, if we care enough about it or are concerned about that kind of thing. There is a joke that the Chinese are listening to us. It is just an assumption that is being made. I do not think there is actually somebody listening on the other end, but there is an algorithm that is obviously listening to what we are saying and trying push products toward us that we are interested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368558">The white rabbit story is interesting. It is not necessarily something that would come up in day-to-day discussions. However, I know that if we connect to someone else's WiFi then suddenly we start getting different advertisements. My cousin has a CNC plasma cutting table for cutting metal. It is really cool, but what is interesting is that when I go to his house and connect to his WiFi, which is also connected to that CNC plasma table, I start getting advertisements for CNC cutting tables. That is wild and fascinating. The algorithm transparency piece is one of the most fascinating pieces of this law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368559">Sometimes on Facebook, we get ads. We can click on the “X” to get rid of the ad. When an ad comes up, one wonders why they are seeing it. If I could get an answer for that, that would be amazing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368560">I am interested in that. What is being fed into the system that is promoting this particular ad to me? That is something I am really interested in knowing. At this point, there seems to be no recourse whatsoever to know why these ads show up. In my virtual personality that lives out on the Internet and in the data collected on me, what recent actions in particular have I undertaken that have driven this particular ad into my feed? I am fascinated to see if we are going to be able to bring that transparency with this bill. I am not necessarily convinced we will be able to do it, but I am fascinated by it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368561">The other piece I do not think this bill addresses at all is the question of social media platforms or Internet platforms being message boards or publishers. This continues to be a sticking point. There have been committee hearings with the major social media platforms, and we have seen countries around the world seek to grapple with this issue. This is precisely what governments ought to be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368562">What it means to govern and to legislate is to come up with a system that balances the interests of all people in a way of our choosing. That is what it means to be in a democracy. That is what it means to be governed by ourselves, so to speak. In many cases we see effective lobbying efforts by organized groups, and in particular commercial interests, that do not necessarily allow the government to get that balance right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368563">We see in the news how we grapple to enable this. Some large social media platforms have amassed a wealth that exceeds that of many nations. Some of the largest nations in the world are able to compete with this, but many smaller nations do not have the resource capacity many of these large media companies do, so there is tension there. I compliment this bill in that it is attempting to have that discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368564">Do I trust the Liberals to get it right? No, typically not, but I commend them for bringing this forward and beginning the conversation. This is going to be a long conversation. Like I said before, this bill is an inch thick. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368565">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252849" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge Park</Affiliation> just made a comment. I do not quite know what he said, but I am sure he was complimenting me on my speech. I thank him and appreciate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368566">Around algorithmic transparency, the piece that is really important, and that I do not think this bill quite grasps, is whether platforms are curating content, publishing it or choosing winners and losers. The algorithmic transparency of that is a big concern for me, and I know it is a big concern for many people across the country. It is interesting this is a concern for people both on the right and the left. It is a concern for all the political parties. It is a concern for ideological differences, and in general for what is curated and what is deemed to be on the platform. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368567">This is also a concern for the platforms themselves, in that one particular message that comes from a platform can then become part of a mob mentality. People could then really go after it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368568">There is no protection, necessarily, for platforms because there is ambiguity about whether they are responsible for messages on the message board and, if they are, whether they are liable as a newspaper would be. That is the major challenge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368569">While I am not convinced, at this point, that we will get algorithmic transparency in that sense, it is important to be able to tell people, “This is our algorithm, this is how messages get on the board. We are not responsible for the messages and, therefore, this is how the system works.” There is no human input. It is just a sophisticated method of getting messages in front of people that they want to see, that they think are interesting and that they find helpful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368570">For the most part, I would say we are getting that right. Where there is some concern is about political messaging. We have already seen that Facebook has worked hard on that, but there is always a spectrum, I would say, of political messaging. There is explicit party messaging, which is relatively easy to monitor and manage, but then there is political messaging that goes farther afield. When it is a random, individual Canadian doing political messaging, how is that managed? That is when it will be really important for us to get the algorithmic transparency piece right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368571">There is another thing I am interested in seeing and have not seen. Part of the government's rollout on this bill has been pushing freedom from hate and from violent extremism. That is important to me. The managing of the Internet and platforms around violent and degrading sexually explicit material has been something I have worked on in this place. It was in 2017 that the House unanimously passed a motion for the government to study the impacts of violent and degrading sexually explicit material. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368572">This was something that had not been studied since 1985. I was not even born in 1985, so that tells us it was a long time ago. The member for <Affiliation DbId="253092" Type="2">Fleetwood—Port Kells</Affiliation> is shaking his head at me. I am not sure what that belies about me or him, but it was a while back, before I was born and before the Internet existed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368573">A study on the impacts of violent and degrading sexually explicit material was done in 1985. I remember distinctly, in 1991, going to my uncle's house. He had gotten the Internet. I had heard about it and said I wanted to see the Internet, so he showed me where the phone line plugged into the wall. I asked if that was it and he said we should look at it. He turned his computer on. It had a giant monitor and a big tower beside his desk that hummed. Members may remember the sound coming through the speaker of dial-up Internet. I remember, for the first time ever, seeing the Internet. We went to dogpile.com, which was an early search engine. That was the beginning of the Internet for me, in 1991. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368574">Here we are nearly 30 years later, and we are still grappling with how to manage this. It is a public information highway. There are public highways all over the country, and the government manages a licensing system for folks who get to use the public highways and roads. There is no controversy around that. It seems like an effective way to manage it. Given that it is tangible and we can see it in front of us, that is a manageable thing. In reality, we are dealing with the information highway. Up to this point, there has been very little direction on the role of the government in managing the expectations of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368575">Many parents who I have talked to are looking for tools they can use to protect their children online, and they are not satisfied with being told they should just be better parents. They say they want help from the Internet service providers. They want help from their government. They want the ability to have some recourse with these large platforms. I am interested to see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368576"> The government says the Internet should be free from hate and violent extremism. That is something that I support notionally. Video imaging is the area where I am most concerned. In the other direction, I am concerned about free speech, and particularly the use of words and typed messaging. That, I guess, is a little harder to manage. However, particularly with images and video content, I think there is a lot of room for the government to operate in, especially with the violent and extremely degrading sexually explicit material that we have seen since 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368577"> Since then, we can chart the impacts of those on Canadian society on a number of different indicators, and they have gotten worse. We see this particularly with our children in terms of the loneliness index going up and the isolation index going up. All of these things are exacerbated by the COVID lockdowns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368578">These are all things that we need to ensure come into this. Freedom from hate and violent extremism is necessary, and we have to get that right. This is what governments are built for. This is what we need to do, and we have to get it right, so I am looking forward to continuing debate around that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368579">The last thing I want to point out, which I find to be a little interesting, and I am hoping for some answers on from the government side, is this bill, the procedure of the House and how this bill will roll out over time. I must say this bill was unceremoniously dumped on Parliament. I was not anticipating it. I have been working on these issues for a while, and it was not something that was clearly on my radar. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368580">I had written to the <Affiliation DbId="253406" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> around this issue, and I was wondering how he was going to manage it, because I do remember seeing in his mandate letter that he was to try to remove hate and violent extremism from Canada through the Internet. I had some ideas and concerns around that, so I had written to him about it. I did not receive any feedback back saying the bill is coming, so I was a little surprised that this bill came when it did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368581">The other thing that I am really looking for an answer on is why the rumour around here is that this bill will be going to the ethics committee. I am wondering why the bill is going to the ethics committee. This seems like a bill built for the industry committee. That is typically where this would be dealt with, so I am left wondering. The ethics committee is seized with a number of other issues, and I am wondering why this bill would be rumoured to be headed toward the ethics committee, when industry seems like the committee that would be more in tune with where we would like to go with this particular bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368582">I am going to be continuing to monitor the debate around this bill. I am looking forward to having a robust debate. I know that, given the size of the bill, we will be discussing it for a while, whether in this place, in the other place or in the committee, as well as out there in the general public.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368611"> At the outset, I want to thank the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> and his team for bringing forward Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, an act to enact the consumer privacy protection act, CPPA, and the personal information and data protection tribunal act. These are important aspects as we, as a country, address the issues of privacy in relation to the enormous amount of information that is constantly gathered, and exists about all of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368612">We are in an age when with a cellphone we have more information at our disposal than several libraries put together. We are able to access personal information about virtually anyone who has a public profile, and certainly about anyone who has created a profile in one of the major platforms, whether it be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or LinkedIn, and the list goes on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368613">These have posed obvious questions for all of us as policy-makers or even as individual consumers in terms of how this information is used, how it is reproduced, copied and misused. We have seen the worst of it over the years in platforms like Facebook where information may have been reused over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368614">At the centre of this legislation are three major aspects. First and foremost is consumer control over individuals' personal information that is out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368615"> Second, it is about innovation. I know the previous speaker spoke about the balancing act that we need in order to ensure free speech and privacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368616">The third element is to make sure that innovation continues. Innovation is absolutely important for a country like Canada. I know many innovators in my community who have done exceptionally well. I have spoken about many of them here. The University of Toronto Scarborough campus has a hub in which many local innovators have come forward and have developed in my riding of Scarborough—Rouge Park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368617">Members may know of the company, Knowledgehook. It is a company founded by my good friend Travis Ratnam. The company was just given additional funding of $20 million to expand the program. It is a platform that allows students and teachers to work together to use AI, devise curriculum and make sure that the weaknesses of each student are highlighted to the teachers so that the teachers can respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368618">In all of these new forms of technology, there are questions of privacy. We worry about the relationship between, for example, companies gathering data for the purpose of insurance, whether health, life, or auto insurance, and the data that sometimes is readily captured in our day-to-day use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368619">All of these issues have become pronounced during COVID. We see that education, for example, is now online for many students whose parents choose to have their kids study from home via the Internet; or for many post-secondary students who are studying virtually. I always go back to the University of Toronto Scarborough campus, which is located in my riding, but there is also Centennial College, where most of the students are learning virtually. These again have complicated the challenges for ensuring that privacy is maintained.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368620">The digital charter that is before us does really allow for consumers to have control over their personal information, and it allows for innovation and a strong enforcement oversight. Sadly, the enforcement aspect has been quite weak in Canada over the years. We do not have adequate enforcement. In fact, technology itself is hard to enforce, whether in Canada or other parts of the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368621">The enforcement mechanism that is built into this legislation is critically important for us to look at. It is what makes this legislation accessible to individuals who may have a complaint. The enforcement mechanism looks to have individuals appointed through the order in council process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368622">I want to speak about the way our government, since taking office in 2015, has managed to put together proper processes to appoint individuals to these important bodies, including judiciary and administrative tribunals, but also other bodies that make critical decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368623">We are focused on ensuring a merit-based system that ensures the individual is fully qualified to make decisions on a particular issue. For me, my work on the Standing Committee on Immigration and Refugees was a great learning experience. I saw first-hand how the IRB was transformed from a patronage-based appointment process to one that is merit-based. We see decisions coming out of the IRB that are fully reflective of the quality of candidates we put on those boards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368624">When we look at appointments, it is meritocracy, but also diversity. We note that in previous governments, judicial appointments have often been focused on men. In fact, in the last several years, we have now achieved gender parity. We are looking at enhancing that and we are working toward greater diversity among other groups in Canada, including people with disabilities. I believe the enforcement mechanism is critical and we have taken concrete steps in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368625">To note, there are monetary penalties that this tribunal could issue. For example, there is a penalty of 3% of global revenue or $10 million for non-compliant organizations. For a company like Facebook, Google or one of the major outfits, 3% of their global revenues is significant. The maximum penalty is 5% of global revenue or $25 million for certain types of contraventions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368626">The government and the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Minister of Innovation</Affiliation> have brought forward a very important piece of legislation.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6368640">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak about the digital charter implementation act, 2020. I want to talk specifically about the balanced approach to the compliance and enforcement set out in the consumer privacy protection act, also known as the CPPA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368641">Canadians have told us they want to see strong consequences for those who mishandle their personal information. Financial consequences can be an important tool in protecting Canadians’ privacy, but so is helping organizations comply with the law at the outset. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368642">I am pleased to say that the CPPA takes a very balanced approach to compliance and enforcement. It would help companies get privacy right from the ground up, and takes a phased approach to enforcement to correct problems as soon as they are discovered. The CPPA would incentivize organizations to get their practices right from the start, and the Privacy Commissioner would have a prominent role in supporting these organizations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368643">Under the CPPA, businesses would be able to approach the Privacy Commissioner for a no-risk review of their privacy management program and help them comply with the law. The commissioner could also ask to review their business programs, without using what he finds in an enforcement action. This is a very important step in early correction of problems. Under the current privacy regime, companies subject to the law are already required to establish a privacy management program, which would be maintained in the CPPA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368644">Privacy management programs can cover a wide range of issues, such as how companies handle service providers or third parties that support their businesses, how they respond to security breaches, privacy risk assessments, mitigation measures undertaken, and so on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368645">However, what is new is enabling the Privacy Commissioner to have a look at these policies and practices outside of an investigation. This would provide a safe space in which the commissioner could provide advice and companies could quickly take action. At the same time, the commissioner would benefit from examples of the challenges organizations are facing and their needs in the privacy space.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368646">We know Canadian companies, especially smaller ones and those starting out, will be very interested in these changes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368647">The CPPA would also recognize not all organizations are the same. Some deal with minimal amounts of personal information, and for others it is central to their business model. Therefore, the CPPA would allow organizations to develop their programs according to the volume and sensitivity of the personal information they handle, as well as a company’s revenues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368648">The Privacy Commissioner has had a long-standing role in undertaking research and publishing guidance. The <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> has also long had the ability to ask the commissioner to conduct research on privacy issues. This ability would remain in the CPPA. However, the minister would now be able to ask the commissioner to conduct research into the implementation or operation of the act. This would help the government know how well the law is functioning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368649">The Privacy Commissioner has prepared a lot of guidance materials over the years. We support this vital role. We want to reinforce a long-standing practice of the Privacy Commissioner to consult with stakeholders in guidance development. This practice would now exist in law so that guidance can be informed by what is happening on the ground. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368650">The Privacy Commissioner would also consult with government institutions where relevant. There may be times when government policy may be implicated, such as with trade policies or public health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368651">These past months have shown us how vital it is for federal organizations to have a unified response on our most pressing challenges. By legislating, we are providing certainty to Canadians that guidance has been discussed with those on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368652">I have stated how the bill would ensure organizations build privacy considerations from the start. Working with organizations and giving guidance individually is a fundamental role of the Privacy Commissioner. We want to avoid any problems, but there will be organizations that do not get things right. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6368653">The law provides individuals with the right to challenge an organization’s compliance with the law, and it allows them to file complaints with the Privacy Commissioner. This is an important exercise of their privacy rights, and the Privacy Commissioner retains his ability to initiate a complaint investigation where there are reasonable grounds to do so. The CPPA would also encourage the resolution of problems as early in the process as possible, and the bill would provide for dispute resolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368654"> Compliance agreements, a new tool introduced under PIPEDA, would remain in the CPPA. Companies are encouraged to come to the table to work out an agreement with the commissioner, without resorting to more formal measures such as orders. If no resolution is possible under PIPEDA, the commissioner would make recommendations at the end of an investigation and the matter may go to court. The court would then start again, with a new proceeding, and maybe it would issue an order. Few cases have gone that route, however.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368655">Under the CPPA, the commissioner would be able to issue orders as well. To ensure fairness, a new process, called an inquiry, internal to the Privacy Commissioner’s office, would be introduced prior to issuing orders. Once the inquiry is over, the commissioner would issue his findings and decisions and may make orders to an organization to change its practices to bring it into compliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368656">The Privacy Commissioner may also recommend administrative monetary penalties, or AMPs, to a new tribunal for certain contraventions of the CPPA. The personal information and data protection tribunal would hear any appeals of the commissioner’s decision and, if required, would decide whether to issue an AMP and, if so, the amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368657">In our consultations, many industry stakeholders expressed concern over AMPs, which have the potential to significantly affect an organization’s bottom line and even put smaller companies out of business altogether. By introducing an inquiry phase before issuing orders, and by separating the imposition of AMPs from the commissioner’s other responsibilities, the CPPA would support additional due diligence in decisions to impose AMPs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368658">We anticipate that some organizations will challenge the commissioner’s orders and recommendations. We do not wish to burden the courts. This is another reason for introducing a new tribunal. It is intended to be less formal than the court and ease access to justice for organizations and individuals. After the tribunal issues a decision, if an organization or individual wants to, they could proceed to federal court and request judicial review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368659">As my colleagues can see, overall this is a very balanced and phased approach. The CPPA would place strong emphasis on proactive compliance activities, such as reviews of the privacy management programs, guidance development and consultation. When there are possible contraventions, the goal is resolution. If that cannot be achieved, matters would become more formal. This graduated approach to enforcement is built on the foundations of fairness, transparency and meaningful opportunities on all sides to achieve compliance, which is what we know Canadians want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368660">Many have said that Canada’s private sector privacy law needs more teeth. The digital charter implementation act, 2020, would give it that, and it would do it in a way that organizations that want to do the right thing have the incentive to do so from the start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368661">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak about how this important bill works to address Canadians' concerns in a measured way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368675">We are surrounded by data that seems to be out of control, lost by corporations, sometimes stolen from governments. Data that we voluntarily give up about ourselves is being collected billions of bytes at a colossal rate. It has a tremendous impact on our privacy and what is being calculated or inferred about us in our daily lives, such if we have a good credit rating, or if we can buy a car or when we go for drinks with a colleague. All of this is very much apparent today, particularly during this health crisis when people are definitely at home and using the Internet to a greater extent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368676"> Everything we do today has some impact on data. Whether we take an Uber or order a meal, that data is collected. Quite frankly, we need to ensure people's privacy is protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368677">Why does privacy matter? It is a question that has arisen in the context of this global debate, made worse by this pandemic, where millions around the world have come to rely on computers to carry out a function for their very lives. When we hear arguments about Internet privacy. A lot of what we hear about this mass surveillance is that there is no real harm due to this large-scale invasion, that people have nothing to hide. Those engaging in bad acts have a reason to want to hide and care about their privacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368678">This is presupposed on the assumption that there are good and bad people in the world. Bad people who plot to take down governments and plan public attacks are the people who have reason to care about their privacy. By contrast, there are good people, people who go to work, pay taxes, care for their children and use the Internet, not to plot civil destruction but to read the news and find recipes. These people are doing nothing wrong and have no reason to hide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368679">In a 2009 interview of the long-time CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, when asked about the different ways his company was causing the invasion of privacy for hundreds of millions of people around the world, he said, “If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.” There are many issues with this statement, one being that this is the very Eric Schmidt who blocked his employees at Google from speaking with the online Internet magazine CNET after it published an article full of personal private information, which was obtained exclusively through Google search and Google products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368680">A few short decades of the Internet, once held as an unparalleled tool of democracy liberalization, have been converted into an unparalleled zone of mass indiscriminate collection. Enter 2018, when the EU has set the global standard for privacy regulation with the flagship general data protection regulations, known as GDPR, signalling to Canada that our 1990s era of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act did not have the teeth to take on big tech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368681">Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would bring in additional privacy regulations. Replacing PIPEDA with CCPA would provide an opportunity for greater detail within the law rather than just relying on the interpretations of the Privacy Commissioner. This is a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368682">The structure will include a personal information and data protection tribunal that will play a key enforcement role by reviewing all commissioner decisions and issue penalties for non-compliance. There will be an expert tribunal composed of three to six members, but interestingly enough it says there may be only one expert, which may be a deficiency in the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368683">What are these new privacy rights? One is data mobility. Subject to regulations, on the request of an individual, an organization must, as soon as feasible, disclose the personal information that is collected from an individual and to an organization designated by the individual. Data mobility is a fact of life and this is a good thing. What format that data will be transferred in will need to be discussed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368684"> On algorithmic transparency, if the organization has used an automated decision process to make a prediction or recommendation, then the organization must, on the request of an individual, provide an explanation of the prediction, recommendation or decision and the personal information that was used to make the prediction. It seems like a reasonable intent and is something it should be able to do without giving up the code.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368689">In some cases, the recommended penalties are the highest in the G7, so they are significant. The expanded range of offences for contraventions of the law are a maximum fine of 5% for a global revenue of $25 million. There are administrative penalties as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368690">One of the issues I see with this is that the legislation and penalties invoke fear, but there will be a question of whether there is adequate teeth for enforcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368691">The law includes whistleblowing provisions that protect those who have disclosed alleged privacy non-compliance and a private right of action that will allow individuals to seek damages for loss or injury suffered through privacy violations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368692">There are new standards of consent. This has been a big issue for individuals. How many people have signed up to a site, with three pages of disclosure to which they are supposed to consent? I would argue that very few people will actually read that kind of detail. Therefore, there is an attempt within the legislation to use clear language and simplified consent. Given the depth of the legislation, that may be a difficult thing to achieve, but is a worthwhile goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368693">Deceptive practices to obtain consent with false or misleading information renders the consent invalid and individuals can withdraw their consent at any time. There is the question of whether people are providing consent for multiple activities or just an individual activity. That should be clarified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368694">The realm of data is largely uncharted territory and we find ourselves asking the question of who owns our data. Our opinion is that people own their data and they should own their data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368695">The word “consent” is mentioned 108 times in the GDPR. In the first reading of Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, it was mentioned 118 times. This sounds great. Who could possibly be against the consent of data? Challenging consent seems counterintuitive in the world of privacy because it is so linked to us and our autonomy. However, it is both impractical and undesirable and serves to explain why our privacy law is in such a sorry state. It is imperative the legislation is written with as little room for interpretation as possible.</ParaText>

It is one thing to consult in front, but now that we have legislation, we need to ensure we get it right. We need to ensure that industry, particularly small businesses, remain competitive. The bill is being sent for review to the privacy and ethics committee. There is a strong argument that industry committee should have a look at this bill as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6368736">Mr. Speaker, exactly one year ago, thousands of Iranians exercised their fundamental right to peaceful protest following an abrupt increase in the price of fuel. These peaceful protests were met by a brutal government crackdown, leading to the death of over 300 innocent civilians and dozens upon dozens of arbitrary arrests. Two months later, Flight 752, carrying 176 passengers and crew, was mercilessly shot down over the skies of Tehran by two missiles fired by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368737">This abhorrent pattern of behaviour is further reflected in the unjust treatment of the iconic Nasrin Sotoudeh, the human rights lawyer, and the horrific execution of Navid Afkari, a 27-year-old wrestling champion. These atrocities by the Iranian regime should not be ignored. No Iranian deserves to live amidst constant repression day after day, week after week and year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368738"> For all these reasons, I would like to thank our government for sponsoring a resolution at the United Nations condemning the flagrant disregard for human rights by the Iranian regime. The international community should never look the other way. We must continue to hold the Iranian government to account and demand that it immediately end terrorizing its own people.</ParaText>

However, as of September 30, the student loan moratorium ended, despite Canada's descent into a second wave. Extending the interest-free moratorium on student loan repayments could make the difference recent graduates need to get through the winter.

With the relief program, we assumed they might want to help the airline workers, 20,000 of whom have lost their jobs; the countless hotel workers who no longer have a paycheque; or, God forbid, the hundreds of thousands of energy workers out west who are now jobless. None of them got help. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6368994">Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to give my input on Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the digital charter implementation bill. I am happy to give this input. It is a timely bill for Canadians because this bill is about access to people's information and, more important, how that information is monetized by others. At a time when big corporations around the world are earning billions of dollars very quickly from information, getting in front of this issue right now for Canadians is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368995">What is being sold? Canadian information is being sold. What do Canadians privately own of their own data? This is the question that should be addressed in this bill. The converse of this, of course, is the targeted marketing and what Canadians get from the fact that they are giving away their information so they are getting back more services that might be tailor-made to them. It is one of those areas where the intent of Canadians not to give away their data and the result of that data that they willingly gave away, in many instances can be very contradictory. Let us tell Canadians first, as my colleague said here earlier, that they are the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368996">Phones are listening to us. Computers are listening to us. Sometimes, computers are watching us. Sometimes, when my sons at home have Siri on, they say, “Siri, turn on”. Siri comes on and I tell them, “Siri was listening the whole time because it just turned on when you told it to turn on.” A lot of information is being culled. We do not know which of that is resting with us, and which of that is public information to be monetized by somebody else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368997">When I read this bill, I saw a bureaucratic solution designed by bureaucrats for use by bureaucrats, with what will be minor effect for the Canadian population in general. As much as we would like to make sure that we actually do deal with the issue around Canadians' private information that is provided online, we do need to make sure that it applies consistently across our country. It is a bubble created by a bureaucracy, and that bubble is lacking any consequences for mistakes and those mistakes will happen within the bureaucracies of the Government of Canada. In essence, from the Government of Canada's level, everything in this bill shows a complete lack of accountability for the government about how it might misplace or misuse Canadians' data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368998">I recall, years ago, the government's approach to what was the no-call list. There was a lot of telemarketing going on at the time and the government came out with a solution. If people registered their phone number it would ensure they did not receive telemarketing. We all jumped on that because on our land lines at the time we were getting a lot of telemarketing. When that registration came up, of course my land line was registered and it said to put in my cellphone number too. I put in my cellphone number, and the next day I started receiving telemarketing on my cellphone where I never had before. What apparently happened is the Canadian government's site had been hacked and all that information was sold to telemarketers. It is a shame because it got no money for it. My information was given away for free and a whole bunch of telemarketers got something from the Government of Canada that was literally stolen from Canadians. Therefore, my data was somebody else's, without my consent, as a result of my contribution to the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6368999">Consumer pricing protection is something that would fall in the same type of realm. How do we make the Government of Canada accountable for what might happen with the data that we willingly give the Government of Canada? Will there be fines? Do we actually tell the Government of Canada that if it does not protect this information the Canadian government is going to fine the Canadian government and therefore the taxpayers are going to have to contribute to the government's fining itself? It is a bit of an around-the-world kind of trip, much like quantitative easing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369000">The problem is, who has this information about me? I do not know, but the party I am forced to disclose the most information to, that I know about, is the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369001">Let us discuss how stopping that government body in charge of the information I provide is mishandled. That would be the Canada Revenue Agency more than anybody else. It has my financial information, all kinds of dates and my social insurance number. Frankly, having dealt with it for years, it is a disaster of an organization. It has the wrong information. It processes information badly. It is the worst organization to try and fix bad information. That is the Canadian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369002">Let us look at what happened in the last handful of months here with the CERB. Data was pilfered and Canadian payments during a pandemic were misdirected. How much of the $400 billion spent is legitimate and how much is as a result of data hacks that went to the wrong entities? Canadians are paying for these mistakes. Canadians are paying now and Canadians are going to continue paying for generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369003">The legislation looks like it is designed for large organizations. Let us start with banks. Banks are another organization that we provide a lot of information to and they have a lot of information about us because they handle our financial information. They know how much we are worth, they know how much we have on deposit and they know how much we owe on our mortgages. They are pretty deep as far as what they understand about us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369004">There are all kinds of small businesses here, as well, that we need to apply. I want to read from this legislation something that should scare any small business person. This is about privacy management programs as required under this legislation. It states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369011">Let us get on the ground here. Someone can walk into a pharmacy and that pharmacy wants the Alberta health care number, which is private government information. The retailers want that information so they can continue to track certain things someone does. They know how much of a person's spending they have and they know how much they can market other products to that person if getting some kind of prescription. Government data is quickly translating over into retail data. That is not exactly something we want to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369012">I will go further here because seniors are the people most affected by this. There are so many seniors who are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. There are issues we go through as we age, including financial institutions, insurance companies and all service provides. Many take advantage of seniors in many respects because things get very complex. We want to make sure our seniors are taken care of in a system that continuously evolves, advances and gets more complex. That is something this legislation should take care of more than anything else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369013">I do not like being just critical. There are also good things in this legislation and I am going to point them out. The purposes of this legislation are that an organization must determine:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369015"> The information for consent is also required. Forms of consent are also defined within. The withdrawal of consent is there, as is the disclosure to cease that actual consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369016">Another good thing is there is a period for retention and disposal of data that we provide organizations. An organization must not retain personal information for a period longer than necessary. These are very good advances in the legislation. I thank the drafters of the legislation for that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369017">I have questions on some of the other parts of this legislation as well. On the transfer of information to service providers, organizations may transfer an individual's information to a service provider without the client's knowledge or consent. They would still be monetizing data that gets collected by one retailer or provider and—</ParaText>

These are going to be pretty significant organizations if we are talking about global revenue. To this point in time, I have not seen how the government calculates global revenue, but I am curious. These types of things do not apply to ma and pa shops and people on the ground collecting information. It is geared toward large organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369023">A question arises from that. We are talking 3% or 5% of global revenue that would flow to the Government of Canada for a transgression as opposed to an individual who lost data. Who still owns the data would be the big question.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369036">Madam Speaker, what I saw in the legislation did not indicate any penalties to the government for citizens whose privacy had been breached. I think for most Canadians, their number one provision of data is to the government, the party they trust the most. That is the party that should probably be the most liable to Canadians for any breach of data, yet there is nothing in the legislation that says that the government owes this duty of trust to Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369038">I am pleased to rise today to speak about the digital charter implementation act, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369039"> Digital technology is changing our economy and our society. Data is now a resource that companies can use to be more productive, to develop better products and services, which has unleashed a digital revolution around the world and which is even more evident during this time of COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369040">At the same time, the rapid growth of data-driven industries and technologies is opening the doors to the potential of new and innovative uses of data to support the public good. Data drives the development of many of the algorithms and protected models that are key to our understanding of societal challenges. Examples include the use of data to support sound public health outcomes; enable smart city technologies, such as dynamic traffic management; and promote greater energy efficiency and sustainability through smart grid technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369041">In Canada, public discussions around socially beneficial uses of data have focused on the emerging concept of the smart city in light of waterfront Toronto development proposals and other smart city initiatives considered by federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369042">The COVID-19 pandemic has recentred the discussion on the role of private sector data and innovation in supporting public health objectives. We are witnessing the central role that data is playing in managing the pandemic. Not only is data critical for tracking current outbreaks or predicting future outbreaks, it has also been used to inform how our health professionals manage critical supplies and ensure they are deployed where they are most needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369043">While data has proven to be of vital importance, stakeholders have identified the need for greater clarity around the legal frameworks governing data sharing between businesses and public sector institutions in the context of smart cities and public health.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369044">At the same time, Canadians' concerns over the protection of privacy and democratic responsibility underscore the importance of defining the conditions necessary to establish a certain level of confidence in any new framework. Data sharing can lead to innovative solutions that benefit society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369045">However, Canadians need assurance that their privacy will be respected and that their data will not be misused. That is why the act to enact the consumer privacy protection act introduces a clear framework for privacy protection in data sharing for socially beneficial purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369046">Under Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, organizations will also be obliged to obtain consent before disclosing personal information to other organizations. This is in line with the existing act and with most of the legislation on privacy protection in the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369047">However, in order to support responsible innovation, the bill makes one exception that will allow private sector organizations to disclose de-identified information to certain types of Canadian public institutions for socially beneficial purposes, without consent. This guarantees that businesses will be given the opportunity to participate in public sector initiatives that use data to contribute to the public good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369048">In addition, by abiding by this framework, private sector organizations can take part in these data sharing activities with full confidence that they are complying with the bill. At the same time, the bill underscores the importance of oversight by democratically responsible public authorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369049">As I mentioned, information that is disclosed in this manner would have to be de-identified, ensuring that individuals' privacy is completely protected. What is more, the act would prohibit using that information later to try to reidentify the individual. This prohibition would be tied to significant fines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369050"> This framework would allow Canadians to participate in initiatives directed at socially beneficial purposes without compromising their privacy. It would also ensure that Canadians benefit from the full power of data to create better solutions to some of the most complex policy challenges of our time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369051">The scope of socially beneficial purposes would focus on areas of public interest that provide broad public benefits supported by use cases and lessons learned that have been identified through years of engagement between government, business stakeholders and civil society organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369052"> For example, ride-sharing and transportation service companies could potentially disclose de-identified aggregate data on the movement of their users to municipal authorities as modelling traffic patterns to help improve traffic flow, plan for better public transit initiatives and to improve road user safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369053">The law would set clear parameters on which public institutions could receive information under the new consent exception, such as health care bodies, post-secondary institutions, public libraries and other public institutions or private organizations with the mandate to carry out a socially beneficial purpose. Many of these public institutions already have robust data governance systems in place to ensure the integrity of information and protection of privacy and would be ready to take on new responsibilities that would be in the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369054">The framework for socially beneficial purposes would also cover situations where different levels of government direct public institutions or certain private sector partners to carry out data initiatives. As highlighted in the reports of our colleagues on the policy implications of connected and automated vehicles, this type of public-private sharing of information would be critical to ensuring the safety and security of technologies that would bring incredible benefits to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369055">The approach proposed in the bill would ensure that the law would be adaptable as new use cases emerge and pave the way for innovative new uses of data that could provide broad public benefit while retaining trust and accountability. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369056">Canadians can also rest assured that the new act will protect their information before and after they communicate with these institutions. All personal information transferred will first be de-identified, which will ensure that privacy is protected in these data sharing activities. The consumer privacy protection act also contains clear rules that will prevent the identification of this information, as well as severe penalties for organizations that break these rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369057">The framework for socially beneficial purposes will allow innovative Canadian businesses and public organizations to take part in resolving the greatest social challenges in areas such as health and environmental protection. This could improve research on the pandemic, enhance environmental sustainability and conservation efforts, and make our roads safer for users.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369058">These actions will be based on clear democratic responsibility and the protection of Canadians' privacy, and will maintain the flexibility needed for future innovative uses of data for socially beneficial purposes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369067">This bill has no provisions to take notice of settlements in the United States to ensure there is parity in the treatment of victims on either side of the border.

              <ParaText id="6369075">The bill, which will replace the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, makes consumer protection a top priority to ensure that Canadians have confidence in the digital marketplace and trust that their personal data will be managed responsibly by the private sector.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369076">It is so important, in an era of global online commerce, for Canada to be putting in place a privacy standard that offers consumers increased control over their personal information as they participate in the modern digital marketplace. The act also includes several important changes to enable and support innovation in an increasingly digital marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369077">I am going to speak today about how our government is supporting business and protecting Canadians' privacy as they actively participate in the digital economy. Our government is working to establish an enhanced privacy framework where consumer protection is strengthened and where businesses are supported in their efforts to innovate in a rapidly changing digital landscape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369078">Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> marks all sorts of important changes to the privacy framework for Canadians, and it is long overdue. It sets out enhanced measures for Canadians to ensure that their personal information is protected, and it establishes new roles and new mechanisms for industry in a way that promotes innovation in a digital world.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369079">We understand the need to ensure that Canadians’ privacy is protected. We must also ensure that Canadian businesses have access to the support they need to grow and compete in a global marketplace based on digital technologies and data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369080">These changes are taking place at a time of great upheaval, namely the rapid evolution of digital technologies. They are also taking place at a critical time for businesses, which must adapt and innovate in a digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369081">The current pandemic has made digital solutions essential to everyday life. At a time when physical distancing is so important, consumers want solutions that give them access to the products and services they need. Moreover, companies must continue to do business and develop. Digital solutions have helped many of them stay afloat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369082">However, we all recognize that new technologies provide businesses with huge amounts of personal information, the kind of data they need to make business decisions and offer clients new services.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369083">We know that innovation and growth are critical, but we have to stand up for Canadians and ensure that this innovation in a digital world happens in a responsible way. Today I am going to outline some of the key elements of Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> that enable responsible innovation: innovation that is done right in a Canadian way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369084">One of the goals of our current law, PIPEDA, which Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would supersede, has been ensuring that companies are able to handle personal information to meet their own legitimate business ends. The other is to ensure that companies do this in a privacy-protective way. To achieve this dual objective, PIPEDA's framework is principles-based and technology-neutral. The framework ensures that this law continues to apply, even as technology has undergone rapid change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369085">Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the CPPA, retains this approach, continuing the success of a flexible and adaptive privacy law in the Canadian private sector context, but we have to recognize that “the times they are a-changin'.” To better reflect the realities of the digital economy, and the continued emergence of new big-data technologies and artificial intelligence, the CPPA would allow for a number of provisions that support industry going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369086">The bill would create a level playing field for companies of all sizes by reducing administrative burdens, which is critical for the vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises in Canada. It would introduce a new framework for personal information that is de-identified. It would establish new mechanisms, such as codes of practice and certification, with independent oversight by the office of the Privacy Commissioner, and it would address data for research purposes or purposes deemed to be socially beneficial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369087">I will outline how the bill would do all this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369088">The bill before us today includes a new exception to the requirement for consent regarding certain business activities. The objective is to allow Canadians to give meaningful consent by limiting it to specific activities that involve real choice. This is essential to prevent the use of blanket consent and lengthy contracts that—let us be honest—no one reads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369089">This will also reduce the administrative burden on businesses in cases where an individual’s consent may be less relevant. Let's consider the example of a third-party service provider that ships various goods. The customer wants the goods shipped, and the business should be able to meet that need. The bill should not add to the burden of providing that service.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369090">The bill would provide for new regulations to be developed for prescribed business activities and would introduce the concept of legitimate interests in Canada's privacy framework. This is something that industry has asked for, we have consulted about and the government has answered in Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369091">Second, we are better defining and clarifying how companies are to handle de-identified personal information: personal information that has been processed and altered to prevent any identification of a particular individual. The bill would allow organizations to de-identify personal information and use it for new research and development purposes. Businesses must undertake research and development to improve their products and offer customers the new and leading-edge services they are looking for. This provision would give businesses the flexibility they need to use de-identified data for these purposes, which would add value for customers and businesses alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369092">The law would also allow organizations to use data for purposes of serving the public good, specifically by allowing companies to disclose de-identified data to public entities. Such disclosures would only be allowed when the personal information could not be traced back to particular individuals and when there was a socially beneficial purpose; that is, a purpose related to health, public infrastructure or even environmental protection. This kind of provision would protect individuals while ensuring we use all the tools at our disposal to address the biggest challenges of our time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369093">Included in the bill is a clear set of parameters for institutions, such as hospitals, universities and even libraries that would seek to receive personal information for a socially beneficial purpose. These parameters would help clarify the rules of the road in new and important fields. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369094">These provisions would also permit organizations to share more data in a trustworthy fashion. They would allow the private sector to work with different levels of government and public institutions to carry out data-based initiatives in a privacy-protecting fashion. By taking this approach, the bill would accommodate emerging situations where collaboration between public and private sectors could have broad public benefits, while at the same time maintaining the trust and accountability that Canadians demand and deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369095">Third, the bill would provide the framework for codes of practice so businesses, especially those in specific industries or sectors of the economy, could proactively demonstrate compliance with the law. The bill would do this by introducing co-regulatory mechanisms into Canada's privacy landscape that would have businesses and the Privacy Commissioner working together. For example, there could be a code for de-identification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369096">I recognize my time is running short so I will simply mention that I would open the door to talking about the process the bill would provide for certification and certification bodies. I think this would be a very important provision that businesses across Canada would use regularly and that the Privacy Commissioner would have the opportunity to work on with businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369097">With that, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>. I look forward to taking the questions of my hon. colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369100">It therefore seems to me that this bill could also be applied to the federal government. Before imposing these sorts of measures, which I agree are desperately needed, on private businesses, perhaps the government should have a look in its own backyard. </ParaText>

They use this information for marketing and targeted advertising. They use it to direct users to websites or places where they can purchase and consume products. One of the fundamental aspects of that process is that companies can exchange and sell personal data, even if that data is separated from the person's information and packaged in a set of metadata. Companies rely heavily on selling and exchanging personal data. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369116">Today we are discussing Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, an act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other acts, which received first reading in the House on November 17.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369117">I am aware of the importance of the issue addressed in the bill. It is 2020. Who would have thought that, in 2020, we would have to come to grips with technology in such a hurry because of a pandemic?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369118">Technology was already evolving at a fast pace, but I can say that we have had to increase our knowledge at great speed. If someone had asked me three months ago if I was comfortable with teleconferencing, I would have said no, but today it is an everyday occurrence. It is important to address this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369119">I would like to remind the House that I represent the fantastic riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier in Quebec. In 2019, the personal data of 2.9 million Desjardins members were leaked. They were victims of identity theft. Their data were resold to people who wanted to use them to do business in the financial sector. Although the leak did not involve banking information, it still exposed the affected customers to identity theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369120">On June 20, 2019, Desjardins revealed that the personal information of 40% of its members had been illegally shared outside the organization by an employee, who had since been fired, of course. On July 8, Quebec's Commission d'accès à l'information and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada announced that they were launching investigations. On July 15, Desjardins broadened its identity theft protection and offered protection to more than 4.2 million individual members and 300,000 corporate members. On November 1, it announced that all 4.2 million individual members had been affected by the data leak. About 173 of the 350,000 corporate members were also affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369121">I will reveal that I am a Desjardins customer and that I was part of this group. Even before the pandemic, digital transactions were commonplace. The current context is speeding things up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369122">Today's bill comes from a good place, because we do need to keep up with the times, but will we be able to apply and enforce it? Are we not putting the cart before the horse? That is the problem with this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369123">Examples in my riding make me wonder. The government is trying to bring in legislation that would impose astronomical fines on non-compliant companies. The government is puffing out its chest, bragging that our country will be giving the biggest, juiciest, harshest and most lucrative fines, but will we be able to collect?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369124">What do we want? We want to protect Canadians and provide them with the necessary tools. Would it not make more sense to invest in a service that gives these tools to our businesses, so they can help Canadians and consumers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369125">I have mixed feelings about this bill. It obviously comes from a good place, but are we taking the best possible measures to ensure solutions for the coming days, weeks and months? We need something concrete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369126">My constituents often tell me that I must find it hard to be a parliamentarian, because I am pragmatic. We need concrete solutions. The goal is laudable, but are we taking the right measures? I am not sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369127">I hear from many businesses and citizens. They are still calling me to tell me they are having problems with Phoenix. They are federal employees who are having problems with their pay because of Phoenix. Phoenix is a problem that was never fixed. It has been around since the Liberal government's first term in 2015. It is now 2020, and nothing has been resolved.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369128">I agree that we need to enact a law to protect personal information, but there may be other priorities. We are seeing it now with the Canada Revenue Agency. I have constituents calling my office to ask if I can help them, because the CRA is claiming it sent them money that they never received, which is a sign that they are victims of fraud and their identity has been stolen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369129">Should we be enacting a law to punish large companies when we cannot even solve the problem in our own backyard? I am aware of the importance of this bill, but I wonder whether we are taking the right measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369130">I mentioned this earlier, but it is worth repeating: I am the member for Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, which is in the province of Quebec. Quebec has a program to help people who have a baby: The mother or the father is entitled to parental leave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369131">Here is another example that boggles the mind. One of my constituents meets all of the EI eligibility criteria, but his claim is being reviewed because there seems to be some problem factoring in the parental leave he took in 2019 and the Canada child benefit claim he submitted during the pandemic interfered with processing his claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369132">That only happens in Quebec. The Liberal government seems unaware of the existence of provincial programs, and its Canada-wide employment insurance system prevents it from fixing the problem. In this case, is it because it is a Quebecker? Is it because he is a father? I am asking because I want to stress the importance of finding concrete solutions to systems before we consider a bill that will punish big corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369133"> I completely agree that those who are at fault should be held responsible, should accept the consequences and should pay if they break the law. I completely agree with my colleagues on that point. However, I wanted to show how bizarre this situation is, a situation that puzzles me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369134">Clearly, we need to reflect on this and update the legislation, but is the version being introduced today the best one? I think we need to send this bill to committee for further study and consultation with specialists and experts. We did actually notice that there is only one expert regarding the tribunal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369135">I do not pretend to be such an expert. I am not computer savvy and, as I said six months or a year ago, I was unaware of my skills and adaptability to technology. Many members here in Parliament have managed to learn quickly, at lightning speed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369136">That is why we need to think about this bill and, as I said in my speech, not put the cart before the horse. We need to do things right to make sure that the bill really meets Canadians' needs. At the end of the day, the goal is the same: to protect society's interests and ensure that Canadians are respected and protected. We are all working toward this goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369137">I will now happily answer my colleagues' questions. On that note, let us be vigilant, because fraud is always lurking around the corner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369155">Madam Speaker, citizens are increasingly concerned with the information that is being collected about them, how that information is stored and how that information is used. When they like or dislike something on Facebook, where is that information stored and how is it utilized? When the bank asks them three important questions, to which they provide a security answer, where is that information stored and who has access to it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369156">As the digital world has advanced and expanded exponentially, regulations and oversight, unfortunately, have been rather lax. Now Canada is in a position where it needs to play catch-up. Like an untamed beast, bad actors have been given access to our information and now we are having to pull back in an effort to protect Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369157">The digital charter implementation act, which seeks to protect the country's aging privacy regime or bring it up to international standards, is much needed and I commend the government for that. However, there are a number of concerns I wish to address as we bring this to a vote. Of course, my hope is that appropriate amendments are made once this gets to the committee stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369158">Technology provides us with incredible opportunities for connectivity, influence and prosperity. However, in the midst of all of these positive components, there is also a dark side. By not seriously enforcing transparency and security measures, we run the risk of perpetuating our nation's technological vulnerabilities and we fail to protect our citizens' privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369159">I want to commend the government for acting on this file and crafting legislation that attempts to right some of these wrongs. It is unfortunate, however, that it took five years to bring this time-sensitive bill forward, but it is definitely a step in the right direction. The Privacy Commissioner has been calling for many of these changes, but the Privacy Commissioner would also urge the House to go further. It is no secret that Canada is lagging behind other countries and we need to get going. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369160">If we want Canada to be a leader in technology and artificial intelligence, it is important that we invest the time and resources to get this right. While some measures in the bill meet international standards, others are lacking. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that we do not just pass legislation that checks off a few boxes and makes a few provisions, and then pat ourselves on the back as if we accomplished something great. What we are dealing with is very complex, sometimes confusing and merits keen attention, as well as bringing all the experts to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369161">Jim Balsillie, the founder of Centre for International Governance Innovation and an expert in the realm of digital privacy, has rightfully flagged this for us. He has flagged the call for algorithmic transparency in the bill as something that is inadequate and ineffective in addressing the real problem. We do not just need transparency. He is saying that we need to go a step further. We also need full access to the information and an understanding of what it means, as well as teeth in the event that something needs to be done about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369162">In order to better understand the problem, let me take one moment to talk about algorithms. In simple terms, an algorithm is a set of codified instructions followed by our computing devices, whether that is our smart phone or television, etc. Basically, it instructs the device or the site that we are on to do something that the creator would desire it to do in order to anticipate our digital decisions and to direct us to the places it would like to direct us to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369163">We know that algorithms are being used especially on social media platforms to affect our shopping habits, as well as our human behaviour. They are used to evoke strong, primarily negative emotions from the platform user, which produce harmful results both mentally and emotionally. Algorithms determine what is shown on our Facebook timelines or Instagram feeds and the advertisements that come up on the pages we look at. Companies and organizations use patented algorithms to push their agendas, whether that is to boost sales or to elicit support for a specific cause. They study us, they follow us and they direct us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369164">As we navigate online, our behaviour is constantly monitored. The data is stored, commodified and then it is even monetized, often without our consent. That information is then used to manipulate and control future behaviours through other algorithms. This pattern is particularly harmful to young children, as well as young adults, who are susceptible to these tactics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369165">Algorithms are now using artificial intelligence, which means that they are in some ways scarier than ever. They can learn how to trigger negative emotions and keep the user online for hours upon hours by targeting them with enticing images, stories or videos, things that would be of interest to them, because, remember, these individuals have been preyed upon and studied for many years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369166">The legislation before the House would give Canadians a right to transparency, but it fails to provide a mechanism for action. It is like being able to see that someone is harming a child but not actually being able to take any action. Again, transparency is there, but what is the good of transparency if the wrong cannot be righted?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369167">Robert Mazzolin is the chief cybersecurity strategist for the RHEA Group. He explained that legislators must insist that AI systems are made comprehensible to humans. In other words, make them understandable. He went on to say, “Enhanced transparency is a precondition for the acceptance of AI systems, particularly in mission-critical applications impacting life and death”. Algorithmic transparency is not enough. Canadians must be able to access not only the algorithms that are being used but what the code actually means. They must also be able to act when the algorithms are being used in a harmful manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369168">Furthermore, when it comes to requesting information about the algorithms that are being used, the bill actually fails to legislate or give direction as to how the contact information for companies can be easily accessed. This might seem simple, but when was the last time members were able to just phone Google or contact it to inquire about something? It is not very easy. When was the last time members were able to get a hold of customer service at Facebook? Again, it is not very easy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369169">There is an opportunity within this legislation, a bare minimum within regulation, to tell companies where the information needs to be located and how it needs to be accessible to the Canadian public. For example, make it so that it has to be accessible on the home page, that it has to be size 12 font, that it has to be a certain type of font or that it has to be a certain colour of font. Make it so that the phone number, email and mailing address have to be listed. Make sure that we are caring for the consumer if this legislation is truly about Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369170">If we want to keep children safe on their way to school, we do not just reduce speed limits in the area. We put in a crosswalk, lights, signs and crossing guards. We issue speeding tickets and we might even have police control. The objective here is to protect the kids, not just put up a speed limit sign. It is imperative that we take a very comprehensive approach to protecting Canadians' privacy, their digital safety and their security. It is not just about transparency. It is about so much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369171">If the bill were to pass today, it would already be out of date. We are seriously behind in protecting Canadians' data, and foreign countries are certainly aware of that. By only addressing certain aspects of digital privacy and ignoring others, the government is leaving Canadians vulnerable and putting our national security at risk. AI technology is upending the international balance of power and shaping the geopolitical competition between nation-states. It would be naive for us to assume that foreign governments are not looking at Canada's vulnerabilities as an opportunity to upset information systems from within. This is extremely alarming and deserves for our attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369172">For example, there is Huawei. Countries like China are seeking to obtain information superiority by acquiring massive amounts of data and using it to their advantage. The Chinese Communist Party has been pushing for greater civil-military fusion, as it calls it, which is evident in numerous sectors but especially in telecoms and data harvesting. The Chinese president has stated that AI, big data, cloud storage, cyberspace and quantum communications were among “the liveliest and most promising areas for civil-military fusion”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369173">It is perplexing then why this government has not yet taken steps to limit the impact that Huawei can have on our nation. In fact, we are the only country out of the Five Eyes alliance that has not limited Huawei or banned it altogether. This is perplexing and troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369174">The legislation is akin to building a security wall around a city, but only one section of the wall is built high enough to keep enemies out. Meanwhile, the rest of the wall is only built maybe a few feet high. If enemies are looking at the part of the wall that is actually built to the correct height, they are intimated by it and stay out, but the moment they take a peek around the corner and realize that the rest of the wall is only built a few feet high, they are in. That is what the legislation is like. It means well, but it is not nearly as comprehensive as it needs to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369175">In closing, I am asking for an opportunity to work across party lines to address the concerns of Canadians to adequately serve their safety needs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369190">Again, I would certainly applaud the government for taking responsibility and putting within the bill the need for transparency around algorithms, but here is the deal: if, as a consumer or as a user, I ask for the algorithms that are being used when I am on a certain website, and those algorithms come back to me as numerous pages of scattered numbers and letters, what does that mean to me? What good is that to me?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369191">Therefore, in this legislation, we actually need to make sure it is not just the transparency of the information being used and the algorithms being used.

              <ParaText id="6369203">When we talk about consumers, we are talking about all of us. All Canadians deserve the peace of mind of knowing that their personal information is protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369204">As the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has said, the pandemic has accelerated the digitization of our lives, which inevitably increases risks to our privacy and the security of our data. This has raised serious concerns about our personal freedoms, our societal values, the public good, and the compliance and oversight measures required to manage this public health crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369205">Clearly, this crisis has laid bare the need for a certain use of available data, including personal information. In this context, we have seen many different approaches around the world. Different countries have deployed an array of technologies to support their efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369206">In some cases, their approach has focused on collecting location data for contact tracing or population monitoring or even for tracking an individual's movements. In other cases, telecom service providers have given the government location data from their network. On that, let me make it clear that our approach, Canada's approach, does not use those types of technologies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369207">This federal government will always defend our privacy and our personal data. Many stakeholders and experts have noted the potential impacts on the right to privacy arising from technologies being used elsewhere around the world. We heard those concerns, and that is why our Canadian approach does not involve these types of technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369208">For example, in the case of the COVID Alert app, our government worked with a variety of partners to support public health efforts to limit the spread of the virus, while also making sure we protected Canadians' privacy. The application was designed with this very objective in mind. As we have said before, the app has no way of knowing one's location, name, address, contacts or other information. In fact, following a review of the app, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner fully supported it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369209">I hope that this dispels any lingering myths about the app, and as we are very much still in the midst of this pandemic with rising community cases throughout the country, I would like to take this moment to encourage everybody to download the COVID Alert app.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369210">Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, before us today, would create a strong framework for the protection of personal information in the private sector. The new consumer privacy protection act would impose requirements for obtaining individuals' consent to collect and use their data. Consent must be granted prior to data collection, and consent forms must be written in plain language that absolutely everybody can understand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369211">While this is extremely important, I know from my own experience, the experience of my friends and speaking to my constituents, and surely this is the case for many Canadians across the country, that not everybody reads the disclosure and consent page before clicking “I agree”. That is why we have proposed in this bill to legislate that organizations can only seek consent for data that are strictly necessary for their purposes. They can collect credit card information if they are selling something; they can collect an address if they will be delivering something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369212">Critically, this bill also would further empower consumers. It would give us the unfettered right to ask what information has been collected about us, how it has been used, whether it has been shared, and whether it has been sold. We, as consumers, would have the right to access the information that an organization might have on us and request its immediate deletion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369213">Another groundbreaking provision involves AI and algorithmic transparency. We are all familiar with these algorithms which make predictions and recommendations with the aim of influencing and impacting our decisions. Whether our experience is seeing advertising on Facebook or Google, which, very strangely, resembles some searches we recently did, or recommendations of videos on YouTube, for example, Canadians are constantly being fed information and suggested purchases based on algorithms that we know very little about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369214">Without going on too much of a tangent, I watched a few weeks ago a documentary called <I>The Social Dilemma</I>. I imagine many of us in this House who are interested in the topic of privacy protection and the Internet are familiar with the documentary. Let me say it scared the you-know-what out of me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369215">This bill would make it mandatory for companies to provide answers and an explanation, upon request, about how any predictions or recommendations targeted toward us were obtained. Legislating that right, providing that opportunity for consumers, is itself a deterrent for companies seeking to make use of algorithms for nefarious purposes. This is a critical step forward.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369216"> This bill deals with a very complex issue for individuals and consumers and for businesses. It recognizes individuals' right to privacy as well as the need of organizations to collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of reasonable commercial activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369217">Our privacy bill is flexible enough to allow companies to apply the general requirements to practices specific to their sector. However, I want to make it very clear that good intentions on the part of private-sector organizations are not enough.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369218">We know that for the new protections included in the legislation to really be implemented, we need binding and effective mechanisms to protect the rights of Canadian consumers. That is why this bill includes serious penalties for those who try to get around it. We are talking about monetary penalties of up to $10 million, or 3% of global revenues, for large corporations that break the law. For more serious offences, fines up can go up to $25 million, or 5% of global revenues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369219">These measures would be among the toughest in the G7. Our government takes the privacy of Canadians very seriously, and the web giants must do the same. We have seen major innovations and digital solutions that not only serve the public interest, but also protect the privacy of our citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369220">The legislation would allow companies to innovate in a responsible manner and enable Canadians to have more control over their personal information. It is true that the digital environment presents many challenges, but we must not let that stop us. There are tremendous opportunities. Back home in Montreal, I am seeing the potential of AI and responsible data usage. I am thinking about Mila, Element AI, Hopper, AlayaCare and all the start-ups and small businesses that are opening every day in Mile End and Mile Ex. We must continue to encourage the development of this sector while ensuring that the public has confidence in the regulatory and legal framework governing these companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369221">As legislators, we must give Canadians our assurance that their data is safe and their privacy is respected. This assurance is necessary not just to foster creativity and innovation, which are essential ingredients for building a strong economy, but also to give us all peace of mind.</ParaText>

As the member for <Affiliation DbId="252701" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation> mentioned, there are many situations in Canada where privacy has already been a problem. I wonder what the member's thoughts are on this. We are like a sinking ship. We have many holes in the Canadian privacy ship. Meanwhile, the government is talking about a scheme that would make it perfect. Why not just plug the big holes, such as the infiltration by Russia, Iran, or even China through Huawei's 5G network? To me that is not the wisest way to handle our current situation. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369249">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to stand and resume debate on Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>, now at second reading, on the consumer privacy protection act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369250">This act, which replaces private sector privacy protections under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, PIPEDA, places consumer protection at the forefront in order to ensure Canadians have confidence in the digital marketplace and can trust that businesses are handling their personal data responsibly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369251">It is important in an era of global online commerce for Canada to put in place a privacy standard that offers consumers increased control over their personal information as they participate in a modern digital marketplace. The act also includes important changes to enable and support innovation in an increasingly digital marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369252">Today I will be speaking about how our government is supporting business and protecting Canadians' privacy as they actively participate in the digital economy. Our government is working to establish an enhanced privacy framework where consumer protection is strong and where businesses are supported in their efforts to innovate in a rapidly changing digital landscape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369253">Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> makes important changes to the privacy framework for Canadians. It sets out enhanced measures for Canadians to ensure their personal information is protected and it enables new rules and mechanisms for industry in a way that promotes innovation in a digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369254">We understand the need to ensure the privacy of Canadians is protected. There is also a need to ensure that Canadian businesses have the supports they need to grow and prosper in a global marketplace that runs on digital technologies and data. These changes come at a time of great change, not only in terms of rapid advances in digital technologies, but also at a time that is critical for business to adopt and innovate in a digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369255">The need for digital solutions in our daily lives has become essential in the current pandemic environment. In a time when physical distancing has been so important, consumers want solutions that give them access to the products and services they need and firms need to keep doing business and set themselves up to grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369256">For many, digital solutions have been the answer. However, we all recognize that new technologies are providing companies with vast amounts of personal information, data that is essential to making business decisions and offering new services to customers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369257">Innovation and growth are critical, but we must stand up for Canadians and ensure that this innovation happens in a responsible way. Today, I will be outlining the key elements of Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> that enable responsible innovation done right in the Canadian way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369258">One of the goals of PIPEDA, our current law, has been to ensure companies are able to handle personal information to meet their legitimate business needs and do this in a privacy-protected way. To achieve this dual objective, PIPEDA's framework is principles-based and technology neutral. This framework ensures that the law continues to apply even as technology has undergone rapid change. The CPPA retains this approach, continuing the success of a flexible and adaptable privacy law in the Canadian private sector context. We all recognize that times are changing rapidly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369259">To better reflect the realities of the digital economy and to continue the emergence of the new big data technologies and artificial intelligence, the CPPA has a number of provisions that support industry moving forward. The bill would create a level playing field for companies of all sizes. It does this by reducing administrative burdens, critical for the vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises in Canada so essential to our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369260">It introduces a new framework for personal information that is de-identified. It establishes new mechanisms like codes of practice and certification with independent oversight by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. It addresses data for research purposes or purposes deemed to be socially beneficial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369261">I will outline how the bill would do it all. The bill before us today includes a new exception which is consent to cover specified business activities. The goal here is to allow Canadians to provide meaningful consent by focusing on specific activities that involve real choice. This is critical to avoid blanket consent agreements or the long, multi-page contracts that no one reads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369262">It would also reduce the administrative burden on the business in situations where an individual's consent may be less relevant, such as a company's choice of a third-party service provider for shipping goods. The customer wants goods shipped and the company should have the ability to make this happen. The law should not add extra burden to fulfilling the service.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369263">Therefore, the bill provides for new regulations to be developed for prescribed business activities, and that introduces the concept of legitimate interest in Canada's privacy framework. This is something that industry has asked for and the government has answered in Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369264">Second, we are better defining and clarifying how companies are to handle de-identified personal information, that is, personal information that has been processed and altered to prevent any identification of a particular individual. The bill would allow organizations to de-identify personal information and use it for new research and development purposes. Businesses must undertake R and D to improve their products and to offer customers the new and leading-edge services that they are looking for. This provision would give businesses the flexibility to use de-identified data for those purposes, adding value for customers and firms alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369265">The law would also allow organizations to use data for purposes of the public good, specifically by allowing companies to disclose de-identified data to public entities. Such disclosures are only allowed where the personal information cannot be traced back to a particular individual and there is a socially beneficial purpose, that is, a purpose related to health, public infrastructure or even environmental protections. This kind of provision would protect individuals while ensuring that we use all the tools at our disposal to address the biggest challenges of our time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369266">Included in the bill is a clear set of parameters for institutions, such as hospitals, universities and even libraries, that would seek to receive personal information for a socially beneficial purpose. These parameters would help to clarify the rules of the road in a new and important field. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369267">These new provisions would also permit organizations to share more data in a trustworthy manner. This would allow the private sector to work with different levels of government and public institutions to carry out data-based initiatives in a privacy-protecting manner. By taking this approach, the bill accommodates emerging situations where collaboration between public and private sectors can provide broad public benefits, while at the same time retaining the trust and accountability we demand and deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369268">Third, the bill would provide a framework for codes of practice so that businesses, especially those in specific industries or sectors of the economy, can proactively demonstrate their compliance with the law. The bill would do this by introducing coregulatory mechanisms into Canada's privacy landscape that would have businesses and the Privacy Commissioner working together. For example, companies operating a specific type of business could develop a code of practice that demonstrates compliance with a specific part of the law, and the Privacy Commissioner could formally recognize the code. For instance, there could be a code for de-identification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369269">Lastly, the bill provides for certification and certification bodies. Such bodies could use codes of practice to certify businesses compliance with some or all of the law. This is a useful tool for companies, especially small and medium-sized identities, and would be backed up by oversight by the Privacy Commissioner. This means that the Privacy Commissioner would have the option to decline to investigate a privacy complaint when a company has obtained a certification related to the complaint. This is not only efficient, but also provides an additional layer of certainty for business and consumers alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369270">Recognized practices, codes and certifications would make it easier for business to comply with the law and for individuals to understand how they are protected. Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> would not only help keep the personal information of Canadians safe, but enable tomorrow's innovators by supporting Canadian businesses in every corner of the digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369271">With the bill, the government has made innovation and economic growth a top priority. It is a major step forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369281">Madam Speaker, as my colleague is a long-time parliamentarian, he would understand that in the last five to 10 years, the world economy has expanded and changed so rapidly, especially on the data side and in the technology base, that we are really running to catch up. If we look at businesses in the past, we see change occurred slowly and businesses, especially small businesses, could adapt to it in a meaningful way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369282">At the heart of this legislation is the idea of providing certainty in an uncertain world to small and medium-sized businesses, which really are the foundation of Canada's economy. The government should be able to provide certainty to small and medium-sized businesses, as it is a key economic driver in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369283">I am excited about this legislation, as it provides for a certain world in a very dramatically changing data period. That is why the bill is important. It will require amendments, though, as it goes down the road, because we will be playing catch-up for some time.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6369284">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252771" Type="2">Terrebonne</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369285">I am pleased to rise to speak to the fundamental issue of the protection of privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369286">Since March 2020, Quebec business owners have been hard hit by the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, namely the lockdown, the closures, the health measures, the labour shortage and the drop in consumption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369287"> SMEs in Quebec have received assistance in the form of tax credits from the Government of Quebec and the Government of Canada to help mitigate these negative economic impacts. Now more than ever, SMEs are struggling under a burden of debt and many of them may never recover. At this difficult time for Quebec's social and economic life, I am worried about Quebec's SMEs, and particularly the small business owners who do not have the time or money to get bogged down in a data protection program that, in some cases, will have to take into account a number of Quebec and Canada laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369288">By amending the Privacy Act, the Government of Canada is creating a number of problems for Quebec's SMEs because of legislation adopted by two governments, the Government of Quebec and the Government of Canada. Depending on whether their economic activities extend beyond Quebec's borders, it is very likely that Quebec's SMEs will not know which law governs their data protection plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369289">The new federal law proposed in Bill C-11 will have real teeth, which means that Quebec's SMEs are likely to suffer, unfortunately. I am scared to think how this bill will affect Quebec's SMEs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369290">The pandemic is forcing many retailers to shift to online sales, the kind of electronic commerce referred to in the bill. In his speech to the House this morning, the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> acknowledged that the protection of personal information is essentially a provincial responsibility and a matter of civil law. He said his bill respects provincial jurisdiction, but a closer look at the text reveals that to be not quite the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369291">It is true that Bill C-11 applies to all federally regulated businesses. However, businesses that are not federally regulated, which describes the vast majority of companies and virtually all SMEs, are not really excluded from the scope of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369292">The minister can exclude them if the province has substantially similar legislation, as is the case in Quebec, but he cannot exclude them entirely. In fact, he can exclude them only “in respect of the collection, use or disclosure of personal information that occurs within that province”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369293">Imagine the mess: a Quebec SME will have to comply with the Quebec law if the information does not leave Quebec, but it will have to comply with the federal law if the information does leave Quebec. Information collected from one customer will be subject to two different laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369294">Which law do Visa card payments fall under? Does it depend on which territory the Visa server is located in? This seems unenforceable to me. If a business is covered by the Quebec legislation on data protection, that should apply to all its activities, not just half of them, as it would under the bill as currently worded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369295">Furthermore, Quebec laws are also adapting to the reality. We must recognize that the federal government's bill represents a step forward, because the current legislation has no teeth. Under Bill C-11, a privacy commissioner could establish the specific practices to be adopted in accordance with the principles set out in the legislation. A privacy commissioner would have order-making powers to force organizations to comply with those principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369296">Under Bill C-11, a citizen could file a complaint with a tribunal. The privacy tribunal will also be able to impose significant penalties of up to 3% of a multinational's global revenue for non-compliance. In short, the major difference between the law and the bill we are debating, is that the bill's mechanisms are more favourable to citizens when faced with an organization that misuses digital data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369297">This bill fails to address the important issue of online identity protection to prevent fraud through identity theft, especially when Canadians engage in financial transactions. Bill C-11 does nothing to ensure that financial institutions in Canada verify someone's identity before authorizing a transaction, which exposes Canadians to fraud. Even the federal government has failed to properly verify a person's identity before authorizing an electronic transaction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369298">I would like to share an unfortunate incident that happened to one of my constituents. This summer, a young man was a victim of identity theft and wound up having to defend his reputation to the Canada Revenue Agency and another financial institution. It was my own office manager who, while talking to a federal official on the phone, realized that fraud had taken place. My office manager took charge of the case and helped my young constituent navigate the unpleasant process that lasted weeks. There was a police investigation and all kinds of documentation. There were numerous discussions with a financial institution and government officials. He had to go to great lengths just to prove that a fraudster had stolen his identity and to defend his reputation to a financial institution and the Canada Revenue Agency.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369299">It was weeks before this young man was able to access the Canada emergency student benefit he very much needed. That is not exactly the kind of introduction a young adult should have to dealing with banks and governments. This whole situation happened because the government did not take the time to verify the identity of the CERB applicant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369300">The government needs to set an example and take immediate action to combat identity theft. This is a serious problem. Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> contains some privacy mechanisms, but there is no mechanism to verify the identity of users or consumers to protect their personal information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369301">I remind members that private information falls under the umbrella of property and civil rights, which is a provincial jurisdiction, as set out in the Constitution. Quebec is in the process of modernizing its act. Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess right now how the federal act and the Quebec act will interface.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369302">However, the Bloc Québécois foresees some problems, and we do not want these problems to affect small businesses in Quebec, which, I remind members, are struggling as a result of the economic issues associated with the COVID-19 crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369303">SMEs carry a heavy debt load at times. Any additional weight on the shoulders of Quebec entrepreneurs is becoming harder and harder to bear. Considering the potential administrative nightmare that could result from how the federal legislation intersects with the Quebec legislation, I would ask that Quebec SMEs be exempt from Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369304"> Simon Marchand, chief fraud prevention officer at Nuance Communications, is a certified fraud examiner, a certified administrator and an expert in biometrics and security. He appeared before the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on May 20. We were discussing fraud-related topics. He mentioned that in the context of COVID-19, telework was a risk factor. This is especially true when it comes to customer service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369305">All customer service agents who normally work in call centres now work from home, in an unsupervised environment. These agents have limited resources, but now have the opportunity to access sensitive consumer information, whether it is data on their assets or information that could be used by anyone to impersonate someone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369306">A second factor is the socio-economic reality, which will no doubt put pressure on many households. When it comes to internal fraud, we know that pressure and opportunity are the two basic factors that drive an employee to go against their employer’s interests and commit fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369307">Some areas have seen a 600% increase in the number of phishing scams involving COVID-19; attachments, links to websites and other methods are being used to lure victims. Fraudsters will be able to get their hands on vast amounts of consumer information, which they will not use in the next few weeks. Rather, they will wait six to 18 months before opening up accounts, taking out financial products and acquiring products from telecommunications carriers. That is what this bill is all about. It provides a modicum of protection, which is a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369308">In terms of accountability, Simon Marchand said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369309">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I think, though, the focus should be on accountability and the responsibility companies have in relation to the information they use to deliver services.... it calls into question the bank’s responsibility, which is protecting that information.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369310">The first benefit of accountability will be to give the government a clear picture of the situation. It will know exactly how many victims there are, and it will be able to direct measures accordingly to strengthen security, particularly in banks and telecommunications companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369311">This will put a burden on businesses, which will have to file reports, but this burden is not unreasonable, since the data they have is already known. All they will have to do is provide them to lawmakers or to a government-supervised body that can present these data more broadly and anonymously so that members of Parliament can access that information and know exactly what is going on in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369312">This is an important step, because if there is a leak, companies must tell individuals what information was exposed and the risk of harm from the leak. That is what the bill does, and it is absolutely fundamental, because that is a risk that we run.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369313">In conclusion, the lack of accountability for federally regulated businesses is a problem with the current legislation. There is currently no overall picture of how many people are actually victimized by having their identity used once it has been stolen. I am therefore pleased that the federal government is taking greater responsibility and beginning to act by introducing this legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369317">I agree with him. The best way to thwart identity theft is to ensure that the person who wants to conduct a transaction is who they say they are. People can be identified based on what they know, what they have and who they are, through personal information. A person's name and address are part of what they know. The IP address of their computer or a cellphone number where an institution can send a text message are part of what they have, and finally, facial recognition, their handwriting or their digital fingerprints are part of who they are. These are ways to fight fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369318">In the European Union, two of these three ways must be used to identify a person. Why does Canada not do the same? These control mechanisms will not cost more than fraud will if nothing is done. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6369330">Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369331">This is an extremely important subject that concerns the security and protection of all citizens' personal information. As my colleague already clearly stated, over the past 10 years and during the current pandemic, there have been a multitude of phishing scams via telephone, the Internet and online shopping platforms, which are increasingly popular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369332">I believe that Bill C-11 is timely and will correct major problems that we have been seeing for some time in different areas. For example, there have been cases of bank fraud, notably at Desjardins, and the federal government has also been affected. I know that the bill does not apply to the federal government, but this issue remains a very serious concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369333">Take, for example, a situation that has occurred in my riding of Terrebonne. For the past month or so, we have been seeing a whole host of complaints related to the Canada Revenue Agency, from people whose identities were stolen by fraudsters who claimed CERB cheques in their name. This shows that there is a gap at the government level, which is very interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369334">I understand that we need to look at what requirements should be established for banks and e-commerce, but I think that there may be some aspects of the bill that we could rework. We are only at debate at second reading for this bill, which means that the bill could be amended and improved to give it more teeth, make it more robust and ensure that it is more responsive to the various threats that could arise in the future. Since we are essentially talking about technology here, the new law should be able to adapt its mechanisms to the changes in technology that will occur in the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369335">However, there are a number of troubling issues that the bill does not address. For instance, metadata is not included in the bill. I am not an IT expert, but metadata is something that we see regularly. For example, if we spend a few minutes on the Internet searching for a camp chair, it is not unusual to then see ads for various types of camping equipment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369336">That is worrisome because metadata can be used to target specific individuals. When a group of individuals is targeted, there is a risk of more targeted threats or cyber-attacks. That is why I think it would be a good idea to improve the bill by addressing the issue of metadata.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369337">The federal government, and the Canada Revenue Agency in particular, has quite a lot of work to do on matters of identity theft. The CRA's mandate is to manage revenues on behalf of the Canadian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369338">However, what happens in the case of computer fraud as a result of identity theft? In that case, it becomes more a matter of public safety and national security. In many cases, fraud and identity theft, particularly in the banking sector, are committed from abroad using fairly sophisticated electronic means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369339">Once again, I am not familiar with the mechanisms used to investigate these predominantly computer-based threats or to protect us from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369340">I am also referring to the recent debate we had—and I do think this is related—on 5G networks in Canada, in terms of the technological means that will be deployed over the next few years to protect the IT infrastructure itself from all threats and foreign influences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369341">In some cases, the threat might involve political or public influence. In other cases, it could literally be individual hackers from around the world who use technology, including 5G networks, to circumvent security mechanisms and break into various systems to steal identities and the personal data of the various citizens that we are meant to protect.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369342">It seems to me that the general intent behind Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> is a worthwhile one, crucial even, as I said in my opening remarks. However, we also need to tackle the technical side. I get the sense that some issues were not considered from all angles so as to ensure that the bill reinforces the back door as much as it does the front door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369343">Once again, protecting online identity is the most tenuous aspect, and we are trying to rectify that here. I am concerned about a number of aspects of the authentication mechanisms, because that is really what this is about. Currently, many banks, institutions and businesses use a variety of platforms to secure and protect the identity of online customers and consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369344">As a few minutes on the Internet will show, private online commerce companies use many different authentication platforms and mechanisms. It might be a good idea to consider using the bill to standardize those online transaction authentication mechanisms, but the government seems unwilling to do that in the current version of Bill C-11.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369345">The government wants to have companies and financial institutions take on more of the control, responsibility and obligations of protecting personal information. The government should, however, set out some very specific measures in the bill to ensure that all companies can shoulder this responsibility. Not every company has the financial means to set up robust data protection mechanisms. I therefore think that the government needs to set some statutory requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369346">As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252602" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> pointed out earlier, a lot of small merchants and businesses do not have the financial means to improve or modernize their technology infrastructure. This issue may also need to be addressed in the comprehensive approach we are advocating today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369347">There is the whole issue of jurisdictions. Quebec's jurisdiction over civil law and consumer protection plays an extremely important role. We know that the laws are confined to the jurisdictions for which they were written. This is not just a Quebec and Canadian problem, but also an international one. By the way, I think it will be necessary for the government to define very clearly these famous control mechanisms and make solid political and governmental choices in connection with the new information technologies that will crop up here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369348">That is essentially where this will play out. We cannot give a foreign government control over telecommunications and computer infrastructure. It is extremely important. We are wading into another field, but to be able to protect our constituents we have to ensure that our infrastructure is not threatened by other countries or by foreign nationals, such as the hackers I mentioned earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369349">Then we have to find some form of standardization to help ensure that clients or consumers are protected during online transactions. Let's not forget the entire issue of metadata, which are a formidable tool for any bad actor wanting to target and attack groups that are more privileged or more vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369350">In conclusion, the federal government must ensure that Canadians can be guaranteed, in all circumstances, that a consistent international standard will be rigorously applied, and that it will be possible to efficiently identify any and all fraudsters. Identifying fraudsters has always been a problem, and the Canada Revenue Agency could speak at length about this in committee.</ParaText>

              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="11">Bill C-216. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="6369354">He said: Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time that we have heard about supply management in the House. Every time that a motion is introduced on the issue, there is a unanimous vote and it seems that the matter is settled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369355">In fact, the House has already unanimously adopted three motions calling on the federal government to fully protect supply management. By all accounts, however, Liberal and Conservative governments were not bound by their commitment when they signed the last three free trade agreements, those with the European union, Asia-Pacific and the United States and Mexico. These agreements and the concessions that were made to reach them were catastrophic for supply-managed agricultural producers. Their revenues dropped by more than 8.4%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369356">Supply management has always been a key issue for the Bloc Québécois. This system was established in 1970 to stabilize the price of agricultural products and, at the same time, ensure a decent and predictable income for dairy farmers, table and hatching egg producers and poultry producers, including turkey and of course chicken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369357">During the time that the Bloc enjoyed a greater presence in the House of Commons and was strongly pushing for full respect for supply management, all free trade agreements with 16 different countries fully protected the supply management system. The strong pressure and numerous interventions by the Bloc made a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369358">The World Trade Organization, or WTO, was established with the goal of eliminating all tariff barriers, and the WTO considered supply management to be one of them. Protecting supply management became an even greater priority for the Bloc Québécois after the federal election that followed the system's creation in June 1977, as any occasion the WTO had to talk about it turned into a direct attack. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369359">The Bloc Québécois was the first party to demand that the three pillars of supply management be maintained, in a motion moved by the former member for Richmond—Arthabaska, André Bellavance, in November 2005. I remind members that the House unanimously passed this motion. All parties in the House adopted André Bellavance's motion, which read as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369360">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That, in the opinion of the House, the government should give its negotiators a mandate during the negotiations at the World Trade Organization so that, at the end of the current round of negotiations, Canada obtains results that ensure that the supply management sectors are subject to no reduction in over-quota tariffs and no increase in tariff quotas, so that these sectors can continue to provide producers with a fair and equitable income.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369361">This motion did not have unanimous support when it was moved, but it passed unanimously at the end of the day, after different groups of producers put pressure on their members of Parliament throughout the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369362">Today the Bloc wants to go further than a motion and insert protection of supply management into legislation. We want to go further because the major Canadian parties in power do not seem to feel bound by the commitment that a motion represents. I suppose they think of it as more of a wish. We want protection of supply management inserted in a statute so that it is given force of law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369363">Then the governments, whether Liberal or Conservative, could no longer ignore their commitments to agriculture and the producers could see who really has their interest at heart. It is important to remember that in Quebec alone, dairy, egg and poultry producers represent 6,000 farms and 86,000 jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369364">With the exception of Ontario and Alberta, all of the other provinces have supply-managed producers so it would be disastrous if supply management disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369365">I would like to talk about the bill that I am introducing on behalf of the Bloc Québécois. It is very simple. It amends the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Act to make the protection of the supply management system a responsibility of the minister. It adds supply management to the list of directives that the minister must take into account when conducting Canadian external affairs, particularly in the area of international trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369366">Once the bill is fully implemented, the minister responsible for international trade will have to stand up to our trade partners and protect supply-managed farmers. The bill will make it part of the minister's mandate to negotiate without chipping away at the system, as he did when the three biggest international trade agreements of the past decade were signed. Of course, I am talking about the agreements with Europe, Asia-Pacific and the United States and Mexico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369367">Supply management is a Canada-wide risk management tool that is designed to protect agricultural markets from price fluctuations. By doing so, it guarantees a fair and stable income for farmers in exchange for their work and their products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369368"> In Canada, only the markets for dairy, table eggs, hatching eggs, and poultry, meaning chicken and turkey, are under supply management. The system is based on three basic principles, often known as the three pillars. Dairy farmers used to give their elected representatives a little three-legged stool like the ones used for milking cows years ago. If an MP displayed that symbol on their desk, it meant they supported supply management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369369">The first pillar is production control via a quota system. Based on research about consumption, meaning consumer demand for dairy products, the Canadian Dairy Commission distributes quotas to each province, whose marketing boards or what are known as producer associations sell quotas to their own farmers. That ensures production is aligned with domestic demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369370">The second pillar is price regulation through the establishment of a minimum price and a maximum price, so that each link in the supply chain gets its fair share. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369371">The third pillar is border control. Obviously, if we do not skew the global market, we cannot allow other countries to skew our market. That is why we use border controls to set very high tariffs and purchasing quotas to prevent foreign products or by-products from flooding our market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369372">For instance, there might be times when our chicken or egg farmers do not produce enough, and that is when chicken and eggs are allowed in to meet this country's needs and avoid overproduction. The principle of border control is very important and is always the one that comes under attack in international negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369373">It is this aspect that has been weakened considerably by international agreements. Canada is opening an ever-widening door in our markets for foreign companies to sell their products here. On top of that, international trade standards are constantly seeking to reduce the tariff levels. Our largest trading partners would like to see these tariffs disappear completely, and thus abolish supply management.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369374">For example, without supply management, an American egg producer that produces one million eggs a day could overrun the Canadian market, cut prices and ultimately take control. Border controls are very important, and that is where the government always folds. It caves, often using supply management as a bargaining chip. Since the government is supposed to represent all Canadians and since supply management is a federal program, the Bloc Québécois simply wants the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party to keep the promise they have made more than once to stop making concessions at the expense of supply-managed producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369375">On at least 20 occasions over the past 15 years, I have heard a prime minister or an agriculture minister commit to fully defending supply management in future negotiations of a treaty. That is not what happened in the last three agreements. The concessions made in these negotiations instead resulted in income losses for producers in the order of 8.4% to 10%. Some will say that Canada is very vast. That is the argument we are given from time to time. We are told that it is impossible to create effective Canada-wide policies that benefit all the provinces. What is more, some experts believe that applying one standardized program nationwide in agriculture or in other sectors will not stand the test of time and will make it more difficult to resolve regional problems that crop up. That was the main argument we were given for conceding part of supply management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369376">The second argument is that supply management does not make a substantial contribution to Canada's gross domestic product. It represents approximately 2%, so that is a good excuse for sacrificing a little bit in every negotiation. This argument fails to consider that this is a very important economic sector for Quebec and Ontario. Supply-managed goods account for about 40% of Quebec's agricultural revenues, or $3.4 billion out of $8.9 billion. Quebec's dairy sector has revenues of $2.4 billion. That is twice the amount of agricultural revenue from the pork sector, which is an excellent export sector and contributes $1.2 billion a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369377">These are different agricultural markets, but the agricultural sector as a whole is very important. The problem also stems from the fact that most supply-managed production occurs in Ontario and Quebec, representing 70%. Crops such as beef, grains and oilseeds are grown for export. The government is always looking to expand markets, but supply management must not be given up in exchange for these markets. That is the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369378">Supply management has survived 16 agreements. It needs to survive any future agreements as well. This system accounts for $8.7 billion of our GDP and $2 billion in economic spinoffs. Without this policy, the agricultural sector could lose 58,000 to 80,000 jobs. On top of that, half of this country's dairy exports would be compromised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369379"> In closing, I want to remind members that Canada is currently negotiating with five countries that are part of Mercosur, which also includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela and Bolivia. This bill must be passed before these agreements are concluded. I urge all members to unanimously support this bill, as we did with the previous motions. </ParaText>

I remember going to a cocktail party for dairy farmers during their conference in Ottawa, back when the Bloc introduced its motion in 2005. I met farmers from Alberta who came to thank the members of the Bloc for introducing the motion to fully protect the supply management system. Unfortunately, in the last three agreements, the government has made small 3% concessions, which represents about a 10% drop in revenue for all dairy farmers under supply management across Canada.</ParaText>

For now, the minister is trying to reassure us by saying that supply management is not affected by this agreement with England. Since England was part of the agreement with Europe, it should not get an extra share. England needs to get its share from Europe, nothing more, so that nothing about the Canada-Europe agreement changes. However, I still have doubts, since nothing has been signed yet and all we have is a Liberal Party promise. A little piece of supply management is always affected.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6369391">Mr. Speaker, it is always a privilege to bring greetings on behalf of the great people of Kings—Hants, even if it is virtually, but that is the world we are living in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369392">I would like to thank the member opposite for bringing forward this legislation and giving me the opportunity to speak on the importance of supply management and what it means to rural communities across the country. I was a little disappointed in the member opposite's comments. He mentioned Ontario, Alberta and, of course, Quebec, but he did not mention the importance this has across the country, including the communities that I represent here in Nova Scotia. I look forward, in the next nine and a half minutes, to explaining what this industry means to the people I represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369393">I grew up in a region called East Hants in the Kings—Hants area. It has the highest concentration of dairy and poultry supply managed farms east of Quebec, so this is a very important sector for us. It is also a key piece of our identity. Not only is it an economic driver in the sense of jobs and opportunities for producers, it is also a key piece of agricultural communities. This is not just in Kings—Hants. It is across the country. Going to high school, we would see tractors going up and down the road. Some of the students and colleagues that I went to high school with would bring their tractors to prom from whatever farm, but most importantly, from our supply managed sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369394">I do not mean to pick on the member opposite because his intentions were good in bringing this to the House, but he mentioned at some point that this is a small percentage of our GDP. That may be the case, but $22 billion is the figure that I have in front of me, and is what the supply managed sector means to rural Canada. That is larger than the auto sector. That just shows the significance of what this means and the importance of having robust programs in place to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369395">I want to talk about the history of supply management for those who might be watching and may not know, or for some urban colleagues who might not know as much about supply management and its benefits. It was created, as the parliamentary secretary mentioned during questions and comments, in the 1970s by a Liberal government. At the time, there was a massive disconnect between the amount of supply that was being provided in the market and the prices that were being returned to producers. The reason for creating rationality was because our supply managed sectors deal with perishable products and producers may not have been able to get them to market in time. This program was put in place to make sure there was an equitable program to support farmers, but also to give the market certainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369396">There have been critics. I would be naive to stand in the House, virtually, and suggest that people have not criticized this system and sought an alternative program to move forward, but I want to highlight some of the benefits of supply management. First of all, for me, perhaps most importantly, it allows smaller family farms to still be able to contribute in the marketplace. Whether it is the milk pooling agreements in the dairy sector or otherwise through the SM5, supply management allows farmers that are in more rural and remote parts of the country to have equal access to markets. That is ideologically important to me, and it is important for our economy to create that supply chain throughout rural Canada, from Newfoundland and Labrador, as we heard at the agriculture committee this evening, all the way to Yukon. This is truly a national policy that creates benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369397">I also want to talk about the importance of what this means. Before I was in the House and had the privilege of serving as a member of Parliament, I was an outspoken advocate for this system and what it represents. It truly is the lifeblood of rural communities. It is important that we are able to maintain it and keep it in place to support our farmers. I will relate a quick personal story, if I may. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369398">I was a competitive hockey player. I played junior hockey in a small community called Amherst, Nova Scotia, and had the good fortune to be billeted at a dairy farm just outside of town in Linden, Nova Scotia. I stayed on the farm, played junior hockey and got to see the inner workings of a small family farm in rural Cumberland County. I can attest to the hard work that our farmers put in and the importance of this system, which allows farms like that to exist.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369399">There are critics who would suggest that if we were to get rid of supply management it would actually lead to a reduction in prices at the retail level. I want to challenge some of those assumptions on the record here in the House. The ideology of some of the critics is perhaps conservative and more free-market based. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369400">I am not against free-market principles, but there have been challenges. New Zealand, for example, went with a much more deregulated model. It got rid of some of its supply managed system and saw an increase in price at the retail level for milk supplies. We also talk about the World Trade Organization, and this is one way to support farmers to be able to create an equitable price. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369401">There are other programs out there, such as the dairy margin protection program in the United States. Maybe some of my colleagues will recall a bipartisan fight in 2012. There was a chance the farm bill would not go through Congress at the time. There was speculation that milk prices would almost double in the United States without the subsidy provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369402">In Europe, there is a common agricultural policy that provides billions of dollars every year to producers. Other jurisdictions of the world choose to go about it a different way. When we consider things like the importance of looking at the environment and having sustainable means moving forward, supply management becomes even more in vogue in how important it is to be able to match our domestic demand to supply, and for sustainability and efficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369403">I also want to challenge the notion there is not a competitive model built within the supply managed sector as it relates to the dairy industry. Many critics would suggest it is a system that allows all farmers to benefit and to succeed. It is simply not the case. The way the Canadian Dairy Commission helps set the price of milk, or I should say the kilograms of butterfat in different products, is based on a model that only allows 70% of farmers to break even after their costs of capital are considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369404">This means that, for 30% of farms, if one is not good at managing costs, whether a larger farm or a smaller one, it is going to be challenging to get the money to recapitalize infrastructure. It is a myth, and I want to put on the record that there is not a competitive model built within the supply managed system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369405">I want to turn to why I am proud to be standing with a government that has fought since 1970 for supply management. When we look at CUSMA and what that trade relationship looks like, the president of the United States wanted to use the word dairy. This was important for him politically in being able to get concessions from the Canadian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369406">I contrast that with the Conservative government under CETA and the CPTPP. At the time, I believe the member for <Affiliation DbId="252933" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> was the minister responsible for international trade. It was a much different situation, in terms of pressure, and what the relationships of those trade deals meant versus our relationship with the largest trading partner in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369407">Our minister for trade at the time worked extremely hard. We did everything to keep the integrity of supply management in place. I contrast that with two trade deals that of course are important, and I would never suggest they are not, but the pressure to get rid of our supply management, or give concessions, was nowhere near the same. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369408">When I talk with farmers in my riding, they seem to understand the difference and how the government was between a rock and a hard place, including on products and things that matter to the <Affiliation DbId="252700" Type="2">member</Affiliation> from the Bloc such as aluminum, for example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369409">I could highlight the programs we put in place, such as the dairy direct payment program, which is certainly extremely important. It was $345 million to help compensate for the trade access that was given under the former Conservative government when it signed these, along with COVID supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369410">I am proud to be part of a government focused on our supply managed producers. I mentioned dairy a lot, but that is not to say poultry, eggs, broiler hens and turkeys are not important. It is all so important and it all matters to the people I represent. I am pleased to see a piece of legislation in which we can talk about the importance of this system in rural Canada, and I would like to thank the member opposite for bringing this forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369411">I really appreciated the time to talk about a system that matters to rural Canadians. As the rural caucus chair for the Liberal Party, I am very pleased to bring some remarks to the House tonight.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6369412">Mr. Speaker, it is high time we had a man for prime minister who behaves like someone who understands the farming community and especially Canadians from rural areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369413">Our message is clear and will remain clear: Canada must restore agriculture to its former glory and give it the recognition it deserves. It is just wrong that neither the current agriculture minister nor her predecessor were directly involved in the negotiations for the trade agreements that became the TPP, CETA and CUSMA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369414">The future prime minister of Canada, the leader of the Conservative Party, will rectify this situation. We are here tonight to talk about supply management. Before I talk about the Liberals' failures on supply management, of which there are many, I want to clearly state our party's position on supply management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369415">The Conservative leader made clear commitments during the leadership race. He made it clear and reiterated, in his discussions with the dairy industry, that there will be no further concessions in future trade agreement negotiations. He will protect supply management. He will respect supply management for our dairy and poultry farms and, most importantly, he will make sure that all farm families are involved in trade negotiations, or any other program affecting the sector, through the Minister of Agriculture, who will be at the table, not sitting somewhere else, away from the negotiations. He will allow more flexibility in allocating the management of farm assistance programs. He will not create a milk lottery, as the previous government did. Above all, he pledged to pay out all the promised compensation, while providing flexibility in how it is allocated so it is done in the way producers want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369416">Much more than that, a Conservative government will raise the possibility and want to renegotiate the overall limits on skim milk powder exports that were given away by the current government. A Conservative government will modernize and improve agricultural risk management programs to help producers deal with all the crises they are currently facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369417">A Conservative government, and I think that this is very important right now, will also ask the Competition Bureau to investigate the impacts of abusive trade practices concentrated in the grocery industry. We know about it, and we are hearing about it these days: huge amounts of money are being demanded just to put products on grocery store shelves. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369418">We believe it is very important to protect the food security of Canada and we recognize that supply management is an element that is essential to the success of Canadian agriculture.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369419">Unfortunately, although Bill <Document DbId="10866114" Type="4">C-216</Document> sets out to protect supply management in the context of future trade agreements, it could wind up doing the opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369420">First, everyone here in the House knows that any new trade agreement would be the subject of new legislation in which the Liberal government could amend Bill C-216 as it sees fit. That is what happened with the Canada-United States-Mexico agreement. The government proved that when it shamelessly opened up supply management by giving the Americans a say in the tariff schedule and when it shamelessly allowed the United States to limit our exports of skim milk powder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369421">Second, if this bill passes, we can be sure that potential trade partners will target supply management right off the bat and counter with their own protectionist measures. This is like drawing the other side's attention to a specific negotiation issue that could well force Canada to agree to new concessions, which would be written into a bill approving the framework agreement, and all because we ourselves put the issue on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369422">That is exactly what happened during the latest negotiations for the Canada-United States-Mexico free trade agreement. Members may recall that the United States' first target was Mexico.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369423">I met with a representative of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. Congress at the beginning of the negotiations. The message they sent us was to stay calm, but then the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada got involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369424">He wanted an agreement that was progressive and environmentally friendly, and he got the attention of Donald Trump. He gave in on supply management, and Canada had to struggle just to remain in this important agreement for our economy. Dairy, egg and poultry producers paid the price as the Liberals modified the existing laws to be able to give up more of our market to the United States. This is the reality.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369425">The main purpose of Bill C-216 is to protect supply management. That is also the Conservative Party's goal.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369426">We do not believe that Bill <Document DbId="10866114" Type="4">C-216</Document> is a good bill to protect supply management and Canadian producers.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6369427">It is important to protect our family farms because the Liberal Party does not keep its promises and is unreliable when it comes to its relationships with supply-managed farmers, and because farmers were regrettably the only ones who were sacrificed at the negotiating table by the Liberal government's negotiating teams for the new Canada-U.S.-Mexico agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369428">In Quebec, you cannot go one kilometre between two municipalities without seeing farms, dairy farms and all kinds of farms. Farmers reign supreme in Quebec's rural regions. If they were not there to pay taxes, there would be no more rural regions. If they were not there to maintain roads, there would be no more rural regions. We need our farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369429">The Conservative Party of Canada heard the message of producers from all the regions in Quebec. I heard it in Mégantic—L'Érable. Like the majority of my colleagues, I received 50 or so letters from producers in my riding. We have all gotten them. Their message was very clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369430">People wrote that Canada's dairy farmers have had to deal with the fact that major concessions were made in recent trade agreements. By 2024, 18% of their domestic dairy production will have been ceded to foreign dairy producers. They are the ones who will provide the milk in dairy products that will end up on the shelves in our grocery stores. The concessions amount to a loss in revenue estimated at $450 million a year for dairy farmers and their families. That loss has a major and lasting impact on their farms and their communities, including their capacity to plan for the future of their families. For more than two years, and more recently in the Speech from the Throne, dairy farmers have been promised compensation. Dairy farmers were pleased to see that full compensation remains a priority, but actions speak louder than words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369431">That is where things go sideways in the letter we received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369432">The letter goes on to say that, in 2019, the government announced compensation spread out over eight years of $1.75 billion for the CETA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Despite requests for clarification and even though the first year was delivered, the farmers have yet to receive any detail on the balance for the remaining seven years. The uncertainty that comes with such an approach makes it very hard to plan the future of their farms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369433">Every member of the House received the same set of letters from dairy farmers across Canada. They are worried.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369434"> The letter ends with the statement that farmers believe that a promise made should be a promise kept. The time has come to keep their promises. What are the goods? What will the Liberals deliver? The Liberals' compensation plan was announced just before the 2019 election. They promised to cut a cheque the day after the election. There has been nothing more since the election. There has been total silence. There has not been one word about the seven other years or about compensation for 2020, even though there are fewer than 40 days left in the year. There has been not one word about 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, or 2026. There has not been one word about the next phase of the plan. I am only talking about dairy producers. There has not been one word about egg and poultry producers who were also promised compensation. They have not even seen the shadow of a red cent despite repeated promises by the <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369435">Dairy processors have been treated to the same worrisome silence by the Liberals, who boast about defending supply management, but only talk about it when an election is on the horizon. We may hear about it because we have a minority government and there could be an election sooner than we think. Again, the Liberals take an interest in dairy producers only when there is an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369436">Did I take the time to talk about the agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico? That is the most recent trade agreement where the Liberals caved on supply management. Has anyone heard the Liberal government talking about a compensation plan? Have we heard anything about the full compensation promised by the <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> that she mentioned again today in the House? Where is their plan? The plan for the agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico simply does not exist because the Liberals are incapable of keeping their promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369437">The Liberals are all talk and no action. We cannot trust them. At minimum, farmers should be able to get answers from the government to ensure the economic viability of their farms. That is the top priority for helping them to get through the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369438">I would like to end with a quote from the chair of the Producteurs de lait du Québec, who aptly described farmers' immediate needs. He said: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369441">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to have this opportunity to talk about Canada's supply management system and to support a bill that will prevent the government from further undermining the agricultural sector during free trade agreement negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369442">Supply management is very important to a number of agricultural sectors in Canada. It ensures a decent income for farmers and fair prices for consumers. It is part of a vision for a more co-operative economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369443">Supply management is also part of the NDP way of thinking. A long time ago, the NDP's predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, included individuals such as Thérèse Casgrain. More recently, former MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau was a staunch defender of the supply management sector, specifically dairy production. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369444">The agricultural sector is a very important sector, but the Canadian government has sold it out repeatedly during international trade agreement negotiations. It happened with the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and Europe, or CETA, and again with the recent Canada-United States-Mexico agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369445">The markets in other countries, and especially the dairy market in the United States, are very competitive. The United States would like to see us adopt their dairy market. As a result of all of the concessions that the Canadian government made while negotiating free trade agreements, our industry has been getting more similar to the U.S. market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369446">Dairy farmers in the U.S. are currently in crisis, and some of them are taking their own lives because their farms are no longer profitable. This is not because they cannot produce enough, but because they produce too much. The economic model would have them produce more and more and try to develop export markets, but that model does not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369447">Some Canadian dairy farmers own businesses that are smaller than those in the United States. They have a stable, decent income. They produce all of the dairy products that Canadians need. This system works very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369448">The supply management industry is under attack for essentially ideological reasons. The supply management system is important, and we must do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369449">Canadian governments of all stripes have consistently failed to properly protect the supply management system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369450">What can we do?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369451">The government does not give Parliament much space or much of a role in these negotiation processes. We saw this with CUSMA, and we are now seeing it again with the agreement between the United Kingdom and Canada. Parliament often does not get to see the text of these free trade agreements before they are signed. By then, there is very little time left to debate the bill before the components of the agreement are implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369452">When could Parliament have an influence on the negotiating process? It has not been for lack of trying in the past. In five years, I have seen several members ask questions about this issue while negotiations were under way. Once the agreement is signed and provided to Parliament, parliamentarians and Canadians, it is too late, and that is when we see that concessions have been made in the supply-managed sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369453">I think that Bill <Document DbId="10866114" Type="4">C-216</Document> is important for defending not only supply management, but also the concept, which I strongly support, that Parliament needs to be more involved in the negotiation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369454">I heard my Conservative colleague say that he did not like this bill because if the issue of supply management were put on the table, our free trade partners might target these sectors more. However, I do not think that we can defend supply management by ignoring it. That does not seem to me to be an effective strategy, and it does not inspire much confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369455">If Parliament wants to focus on the supply-managed sectors and do everything it can to defend supply management, given that we have a government that regularly makes promises about supply management and then does not keep them, this bill will allow us to truly say that Parliament supports supply management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369456">I will once again thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252700" Type="2">Bécancour—Nicolet—Saurel</Affiliation> for introducing this bill. As I said at the beginning, I am very pleased and proud to support Bill C-216.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369460">I am going to address everyone. This is the moment of truth. This is the time for action. We are sick of the old promises and old policies. Today, a promise was made to defend supply management. However, the promise was made by members of the political party that made the first concessions, so I have a hard time believing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369461">I want my speech to unite people. We need to listen to the farmers who are on the ground, much like we should be listening to members when they are giving speeches. The president of the Union des producteurs agricoles made a public statement this morning, calling on all parties in the House to adopt this bill, because farmers are tired of promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369462">On November 18, the chair of the Producteurs de lait du Québec issued a press release. It was not a partisan message urging people to vote for the Bloc Québécois. It simply encouraged members to vote in favour of this fundamental and necessary bill. We do not want to hear that laws can be amended. Come on. We just voted on a bill on training for judges. No one pointed out that a future government could repeal that act. We passed it, and we are moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369463">Passing legislation would give us uniquely effective ways of protecting the industry. We want concrete action. I may seem angry, but that anger is justified because it is on behalf of farmers and processors. These people are waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369464">As mentioned earlier, we are not just talking about breaches in supply management. In the most recent agreement, the government went so far as to limit our exports to other countries, countries that are not even part of the agreement. That makes no sense whatsoever. What is the next step? This request to limit exports of milk proteins was made because of class 7. The Americans wanted to limit our exports to other countries because of the existence of class 7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369465">The Government of Canada caved on both fronts. Not only did we lose class 7, but we now have export limits imposed on us. Furthermore, it is unbelievable that the Canada-United States-Mexico agreement, or CUSMA, came into effect on July 1 rather than August 1 like it was supposed to, according to all of the commitments that had been made. It is shameful that we have gotten to this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369466">Pierre Falardeau said, “If you lie down, they will stomp on you. If you remain standing and resist, they will hate you, but they will call you 'sir'.” In the latest negotiations, the Canadian government chose to lie down. That is a problem. It is time to stand up. We will help the government with this bill. The solution is right here. This is the moment of truth. When the time comes to vote on Bill C-216, we will know who truly stands up for agriculture. This is what the sector wants. People need it. A total of 18% of the dairy market is being given up. For other sectors, it is between 7% and 10%. That is huge. Nobody is keeping promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369467"> This evening, the Liberals are telling us that we must vote for them, that they are not interested in this legislation, that they will deal with the supply management issue and that they will defend it. How can anyone stand for that yet again? That means nothing to farmers, which is why they are ending their silence today, speaking out about a bill and calling on all parties here to set partisanship aside and work together. Supply management is the lifeblood of our regions. It keeps our rural communities alive.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369468">When we talk about supply management, we often think of farmers. Some might say they have an advantage, because there are quotas. No food is wasted most of the time. Of course, there was a crisis this year under exceptional circumstances. Still, the supply management system has proven its effectiveness, since farmers were able to adjust very quickly. Unlike most other sectors of the economy, they did not ask the government for any assistance. All they want is the compensation that they were promised but that has not been delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369469">How can we trust a government that tells us not to worry, that it will compensate us, but that has yet to pay out one red cent two years on? The government has delivered only one cheque out of eight in the dairy sector. It has given nothing to egg farmers, nothing to poultry farmers, and nothing to processors. The amounts were determined over a year ago, but nothing is happening. By providing legislative protection for supply management, we are forcing future governments to show some backbone.

              <ParaText id="6369479"> Mr. Speaker, this evening, I am speaking about a very important subject that I raised during oral question period a while ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369480">During the pandemic, we realized that Canadians with very specific needs were struggling to get answers in French from various departments. French also seems to have been dropped at meetings, and that is a serious problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369481">We have gotten all kinds of reports showing that during the crisis, it became harder and harder for francophones to receive answers in French and for anglophones in minority situations to receive clear answers in their language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369482">That is a very serious problem. We informed the President of the Treasury Board and asked him for answers about this. Unfortunately, the answers I was given during oral question period were very vague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369483">This leads me to a hot topic in the media, namely the importance of the French language for Quebec and, in particular, the position of the Liberal Party of Canada and its members on the notion that French is declining in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369484">In a couple of days, we will have an opportunity to hold a very important debate on the decline of French in Montreal. Anyone who has had the opportunity to go to Montreal in recent months—perhaps a little less often in recent weeks because of the pandemic—can attest to how much rarer it is to be addressed in French in the great city of Montreal. It is important for us to recognize this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369485">We have just one important question for the government and that is the following: Will we get its bill to improve the Official Languages Act before Christmas, yes or no? That is what I asked in oral question period, and I hope that tonight I will finally get the final, clear answer that, yes, the Liberals will introduce their bill before the holidays.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369486">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to respond to my colleague from Mégantic—L'Érable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369487">For our government, our two official languages are the greatest expression of our values as a country, our values of collaboration, openness and respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369488">It is precisely because of this central role of French and English in our common identity that our government has always taken the necessary measures to support our communities. It is also for these reasons that we have committed to modernizing and strengthening the Official Languages Act so that it may better serve Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369489">I would remind my colleague that we made historic investments in official languages through our action plan for official languages 2018-2023 entitled “Investing in Our Future”. We revised the official languages regulations that govern the delivery of federal services in order to better serve Canadians in the official language of their choice. We also brought back the long form census and added linguistic questions to the 2021 census that will help better enumerate those who are entitled to an education in the minority language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369490">Our commitment to better serve Canadians in the official language of their choice has been crystal clear since 2015. We showed this commitment by making it a priority to review the official languages regulations governing the Government of Canada’s communications with and services to the public. In doing so, we created the ideal conditions to better serve Canadians in the language of their choice. In the early days of this pandemic, we made sure that critical information was available to Canadians in the official language of their choice, and we are continuing to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369491">We have addressed every situation that could impede information on issues affecting the health of Canadians, and we have taken swift action to support the arts and culture sectors so that our organizations in linguistic minority communities do not suffer too much in this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369492">We have received broad support for the assistance we have provided, which even the Commissioner of Official Languages has acknowledged. I might add that, thanks to this emergency support fund for arts and culture, about $10 million has been directly invested in nearly 500 organizations in official language minority communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369493">We agree with the Commissioner of Official Languages. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the importance of communication with the public and the delivery of services to Canadians. That is precisely why we are investing heavily to train our public servants, amend our laws, create the right conditions to support the health and vitality of our official language communities and support official language learning.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369498">Mr. Speaker, it was my privilege to ask a question in the House a few weeks ago about the trucking industry and how it relates to environmental policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369499">One thing that we can all agree on is that most Canadians are at the point where they believe that some plan is needed and that some actions need to be taken to help our environment and to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we have. There may be disagreement on exactly what to do, but people would more or less agree that something needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369500">It was interesting to see Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> introduced by the government, a bill that had no plan and no targets. It was missing a lot of things, including consequences. If there were targets that were missed, there were no consequences for that in the bill. I found it ironic that the government has been unable to achieve the targets that Prime Minister Harper set years ago for 2030. The government is not on track to hit those targets either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369501">The trucking industry is significant in our country. Transportation accounts for about a quarter of the greenhouse gases produced in Canada, and of that quarter, the trucking industry produces a significant amount. Therefore, the trucking industry is a key player when it comes to reducing greenhouse gases in Canada. Roughly 90% of our goods travel by truck at some point in their lifespan. Ten million trucks cross the border every year between Canada and the United States, so there is a significant number of trucks on the road and they produce a significant amount of greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369502">As I spoke to members of the trucking industry, they were very much interested in playing a role in looking forward and developing future technologies and future plans to reduce the amount of carbon from trucking in the environment. Decarbonization of the trucking industry is what they would say. They would like to be a part of it. They would like to be at the table discussing plans for this. They know that, for their industry to succeed in the future, they are going to have to make changes and they want to be a part of those discussions. What they are asking for is to have a task force of engine manufacturers, the government, environmental groups, trucking industry players and drivers, all the players together around the table, coming up with a plan and a strategy for how to decarbonize the trucking industry going forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369503">A few weeks ago, at the environment committee, I asked Marc D'Iorio, director general of energy and transportation at the Department of the Environment, if there were any plans to have a task force such as this. He said, “I'm not aware of direct work to create a working group. However, there are a number of measures being considered”, and he went on basically to say that they are going to come up with a plan and then they will tell others what it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369504">I asked him to clarify. I said, “Are you saying that there have been no discussions to create a working group to get industry players in line with this, no efforts to get all of the people at the table to help develop these types of regulation?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369505">He said, “Not that I'm aware of.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369506">I asked the same question of the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>, and his answer was that “obviously there is a need for consultation”, but that there was no plan for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369507">When we come up with something as important as a plan for reducing carbon in the trucking industry, it is important that all the players have a role to play, that all the players' input is gathered and considered, and that a good plan is developed, because we have to make sure, not only that we reduce greenhouse gases but that the plan is workable. It has to allow industry to survive and produce its service at a price that is going to work and that customers will be able to pay. If government goes in and just creates regulations and dumps it on the industry, that is going to be a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369508">Therefore, I would hope that the government would see this and see the logic of getting all the players at the table up front to develop a plan together, so that everybody has a say in it and a good plan can be developed. Then we will have no need to rework the legislation later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369509">My question for the government is the same question: Is the government planning to have a task force made up of all these industry players as it develops regulations for the trucking industry?</ParaText>

We have made announcements across the various areas of transportation and I know that, as a government, we are focused on significant investments. We have invested heavily, as a government, in public transit infrastructure and made historic announcements. The last Parliament alone, there was $70 billion toward our environment plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369513"> It is disappointing to see the hon. member talk about the environment. I really hope that he moves forward and he encourages his party and his leader to move forward on a credible plan for the environment, because we have not seen that yet.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369520">We were glad to see the government finally fix its flawed, broken commercial rent program that was landlord-driven to make it tenant-driven, but we are extremely disappointed that the government will not backdate it to April 1. Many of these businesses are in arrears with their landlords or riddled with debt, yet the government refuses to go backward, even though it knows that most of the businesses are in deep trouble, especially with the second wave. The <Affiliation DbId="263832" Type="96">Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> said the government is moving forward, but that debt is moving forward with small business owners, who did not get any help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369521">I want to talk about the businesses that were completely left out: start-ups. There is a whole subset of businesses that did their part, started up and closed their doors for public health. However, any of them that opened after March 1 or later and closed their doors for public health, or were ready to open after March 15, were prevented from getting any of the programs. This is totally unacceptable, and I want to talk about a couple of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369522">Graham Hafey opened V2V Black Hops Brewing, down in Langford. He is a veteran. He served in the Canadian military and used his life savings to open a for-profit social venture where part of the profits go to helping veterans with PTSD. He has already donated $6,500, but he has not gotten any help through the commercial rent program or the wage subsidy, and has not been able to access the loan program. His business is looking at going bankrupt. We are in the middle of the second wave and it has closed its doors, because of the health order from Dr. Bonnie Henry, to protect public health. He is getting no help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369523">Another constituent of mine, Lisa Jaster from Courtenay, owns The Lost Faucet sauna house. She opened in February 2020. She cannot get the CEBA loan and has paid thousands of dollars to contractors. She does not have a fighting chance without any support. She has been completely abandoned by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369524">I am thinking about my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253026" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, who has been fighting really hard for Peter Wood, who owns Bear &amp; Joey Cafe in Victoria. He put his life savings into developing this business. He opened in March and has been doing takeout. He has 30 staff members. Now B.C. is in the second phase of the lockdown and he is paying $11,500 a month in rent. He cannot get any help from the government. His business has been abandoned, like many businesses across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369525">These businesses actually have the ability to demonstrate that they are genuine and have invested in small business through presenting one or more of the following: proof of loans and financing, proof of long-term leases and contracts for building and construction. They often demonstrate that they are going to be impacted by the second wave by comparing revenue from one period to another, because some of them have been open for several months now. However, with the winter months ahead, they have had to reduce capacity or close their doors. They are demonstrating, post-2020, that they are operating at a loss and are not going to be able to keep their staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369526">The sense of urgency for these businesses could not be greater. Why is the government abandoning them? It is unfair. These businesses have invested in our communities in our country and they are job creators. The government needs to step up to the plate. We have solutions and we want to work with the government. We hope it will do something to support these small businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369527">Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his intervention on behalf of small businesses in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369528">To break from my prepared remarks for a moment, let me first extend my empathy to the business owners he mentioned who are struggling in his own community. He can rest assured that I am having similar conversations with businesses and have been having them from the outset of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369529">However, the suggestion, implicitly or explicitly, that we have abandoned small businesses is disingenuous in the extreme. The hon. member knows that to help keep Canadians safe, we decided to make it more affordable for businesses to do the right thing and shut down or reduce traffic through their premises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369530">We did through Bill <Document DbId="10926615" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which just received royal assent a few days ago. It extends the wage subsidy to next summer and, importantly, creates the new Canada emergency rent subsidy. This is going to provide a subsidy of up to 65% to businesses that have lost revenue as a result of this pandemic and up to 90%, with the additional lockdown support, to those that have been ordered to close as a result of a public health order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369531">With respect to the wage subsidy, it is contributing directly to help 3.8 million Canadian workers stay on the payroll. It does not just help them keep getting paid. It also helps their employers retain and rehire them if they had to furlough them to make ends meet throughout this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369532">We have advanced the Canada emergency response benefit, which self-employed people were eligible for. It has helped keep food on the table for nine million Canadians. We have advanced the Canada emergency business account to provide interest-free loans, partially forgivable loans, and we are now increasing them from $40,000 to $60,000, up to $20,000 of which will be forgivable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369533">The reality is that we have done what we can to meet many needs of many businesses. We have even established the regional relief and recovery fund for businesses that did not qualify for some of the supports I mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369534">While I appreciate fully that the hon. member has the best of intentions in trying to defend the small businesses in his community, I do not believe it is appropriate, and in fact I think it is ludicrous, to suggest our government has abandoned small businesses, as we have launched more support for them than any other government in the history of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369535">Small businesses should know they have a friend in our government. We have been there for them from day one of this pandemic and we will be there for them until it is over.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369536">Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of respect for the parliamentary secretary, but clearly the government is tone deaf. He did not hear what I had to say. Small businesses that started after March 15 have been abandoned. They have not been able to access the wage subsidy. They have not been able to access the loan program. They have not been able to access the commercial rent program, even the new one. Even Bill <Document DbId="10926615" Type="3">C-9</Document> does not help those businesses. They have been completely abandoned. He needs to address what the Liberals are going to do for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369537">We kicked and screamed so the wage subsidy would go from 10% to 75% and so the Liberals would fix the commercial rent program and expand the CEBA program. The member can count on me to be kicking and screaming until they fix their programs to help support the start-ups that have been completely abandoned by the government. I will be back here tomorrow and will be back here the week after. Until the government helps them, the New Democrats will be in their corner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369538">The Liberals need to stop patting themselves on the back and start doing things to fix these broken programs so the people who need the help the most get it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369539">Mr. Speaker, we have been listening to feedback from Canadians from the very beginning. The hon. member drew attention to the fact that when we listened to stakeholders we increased the wage subsidy from 10% to 75%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369540">With respect to the emergency business account, we have increased the threshold from $40,000 to $60,000, and widely expanded eligibility. With respect to the Canada emergency rent subsidy, we have now changed the program to make it tenant-oriented, with a direct application to make it more accessible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369541">We are going to continue to listen to how these programs can be improved. In fact, we have made adjustments to some of them to help new businesses that initially did not qualify on the basis of a year-to-year comparison so they could compare their revenue with that from earlier months, pre-pandemic, in the same year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369542">It is a challenging thing to help businesses through the pandemic, but we are going to continue to listen to small business stakeholders so we can implement policies that will save as many businesses as possible and allow many workers to remain on the payroll so they can put food on the table for their families.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6369629">Mr. Chair, it is a pleasure to speak in the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369630">The primary reason I am here today is to discuss the spending plans for Fisheries and Oceans Canada for the 2020-21 fiscal year. In these main estimates, I am seeking a total of $3.5 billion, which represents a $469 million increase over last year. For the most part, this increase is primarily the result of new funding to advance reconciliation between the Crown and indigenous peoples by implementing agreements and treaties, as well as engaging with indigenous communities and stakeholders on fisheries policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369631">It also represents incremental funding to continue the Canadian Coast Guard's fleet recapitalization projects, which will help to modernize the fleet and extend the life of its existing vessels, ensuring that the Coast Guard can continue to deliver critical services in support of the safety of Canada's coasts, waterways and oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369632">Planned spending will help my department provide important economic opportunities to Canadians in coastal communities, sustain and rebuild fisheries to ensure that they remain healthy for future generations, and protect and promote our oceans, coasts and waterways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369633">As the federal minister responsible for fisheries and oceans, I am responsible for ensuring that our marine resources are managed for the long term and in the public interest. It is also incumbent upon me to advance Canada's commitment to reconciliation by ensuring that my department works in close collaboration with indigenous peoples to manage Canada's fisheries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369634">This can only be done through the co-development of new solutions that are consistent with the constitutional protections provided to aboriginal and treaty rights, and meaningfully advance Canada's important relationships with indigenous peoples, while ensuring a stable, predictable fishery for all participants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369635">Funding for reconciliation on indigenous rights issues will be used to implement reconciliation agreements and treaties, as well as engage with indigenous communities and stakeholders on fisheries policy. These landmark agreements are designed to help close economic gaps through the development of partnerships and co-management regimes, and by increasing aboriginal access to fisheries licences and quotas, thereby augmenting their participation in fishing-related activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369636">Our government is committed to working alongside indigenous peoples to collaboratively manage this vital resource and ensure that as stewards of our land and waters they have a rightful place at the table when it comes to the management of our fisheries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369637">One of the most important priorities is restoring the health of wild salmon stocks and other important fish stocks across Canada. As members know, our government announced an additional $107 million to support the implementation of stock assessment and rebuilding provisions in the renewed fisheries act to sustain Canada's wild fish stocks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369638">We also launched the B.C. salmon restoration and innovation fund and the Quebec fisheries fund, both modelled on the very successful Atlantic fisheries fund to support projects focused on building resilience thorough restoration, promotion of science partnerships, innovation and adoptive technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369639">Our government is also making an additional contribution of $5 million to the Pacific Salmon Endowment Fund Society to support the important work of the Pacific Salmon Foundation to engage community groups in salmon conservation. These new funds will enable the foundation to be even more effective going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369640">These are among many activities that support our wild salmon policy implementation plan over the next five years to support important changes to the management of our aquaculture policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369641">Keeping mariners safe and protecting our marine environment is a duty we entrust to the brave women and men in the Canadian Coast Guard. They are the backbone of one of the strongest marine safety systems in the world. Our government is committed to providing the Coast Guard with the tools it needs to keep Canadians safe and keep our economy moving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369642">In 2019, we announced the largest investment ever made to renew the Coast Guard fleet with 24 new large ships, 16 multi-purpose vessels, two Arctic offshore patrol ships, and six program icebreakers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369643"> Additionally, our government also announced investments of over $2 billion for the comprehensive vessel life extension program for the Coast Guard's existing fleet. Building whole new classes of vessels takes a great deal of time, planning, money and effort. Repairs, refits and vessel life extension work must be carried out on the existing fleet until new ships are delivered under the national shipbuilding strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369644">We recently marked the completion of the first class of ships built under Canada national shipbuilding strategy with the acceptance of three offshore fishery science vessels. These are Canada's first-ever vessels purposely designed and built for vital offshore fisheries research, science and monitoring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369645">The Canadian Coast Guard would not be what it is today without the tremendous support of Canada's shipbuilding and marine industry, which fuels innovation and skills development, and creates new opportunities for workers and businesses across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369646">Our significant commitment to renew the Coast Guard fleet will provide our crews with state-of-the-art equipment and preserve the world-class marine safety regime that Canada enjoys.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369647">On oceans protection, our government has exceeded its marine conservation targets to protect 10% of our oceans by the end of 2020. We are at nearly 14% now and already working toward our 25% target by 2025. That is with real protections that will have biodiversity benefits for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369648">This past summer, Canada joined the United Kingdom's global ocean alliance. One of the key focuses of this alliance is advocating for the adoption of the global target of 30% by 2030, which is a key pillar of next year's Convention on Biological Diversity, COP 15 meeting. Our historic $1.5-billion oceans protection plan is creating a world-leading marine safety system, restoring and protecting marine and coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhancing environmental and local emergency response, and strengthening our ability to trade with confidence and safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369649">As we go forward, we will accelerate the use of tools such as marine spatial planning to allow us to plan our ocean spaces in collaboration with provincial and territorial partners, indigenous peoples, and industry and environmental stakeholders. Our government has invested in Canada's ocean supercluster, composed of businesses, academia and non-profits, to accelerate innovation in sustainable economic growth in our oceans. We are mobilizing internationally to deliver the scientific knowledge, innovation and capacity needed to strengthen oceans protection because science and innovation will be the critical pillar of the strong, blue economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369650">Our government is committed to promoting economic opportunities for Canadians while ensuring our oceans and resources remain healthy for future generations. As part of the approval of the Trans Mountain expansion project, our government put forward eight accommodation measures to address concerns raised by indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369651">We are implementing four of these measures, which focus on building capacity and enhancing long-term relationships with indigenous groups. These measures seek to advance shared objectives for maintaining and restoring fish habitat, understanding and monitoring the cumulative effects and improving spill prevention response capacity. I look forward to sharing more about these and other developments with my fellow parliamentarians in the months ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369652">Our nation's prosperity depends on making sure that the benefits of growing the economy are felt by more and more people with good, well-paying jobs for the middle class. We are well positioned to deliver on the government's priorities, and the investments I have mentioned will allow DFO and the Coast Guard to continue to carry out the important work of service to Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369655">Mr. Chair, British Columbia is home to a significant number of recreational fishers who drive the economies of small coastal communities. In order to continue to thrive, they need access and opportunity to fish. Billions of dollars of economic activity depend on it and is at risk if we do not take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369656">I had the opportunity recently to go out with a group of recreational fishers on Vancouver Island and talk about how we as a federal government can help. They fully recognize that there are stocks of concern and that we are having to make some very tough decisions to ensure that there are more fish in the water for the benefit of future generations. One solution they continue to raise with me and I know they have raised with the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is a mark-selective fishery. The idea seems to have a lot of merit and can contribute significantly to providing greater access and opportunity while we work on longer-term restorative measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369657">Could the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> take this opportunity to elaborate on what she and/or the department is doing to consider this idea and potentially implement it going forward and could she also provide any insight into any complicating factors that might have to be figured out prior to implementing such a fishery?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369658">Mr. Chair, first of all, I support exploring a mark-selective fishery. I understand how important the public fishery is to B.C.'s economy. A number of small businesses, whether tour guides or lodges, have suffered recently and not only due to the loss of tourism this year, but also due to the loss of the wild salmon. The cascading implications have not just been on them, but on first nations commercial harvesters and so many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369659">A mark-selective fishery is one possible option that can be explored in terms of fish retention while reducing impacts to wild stocks. Indeed, there is no smoking gun when it comes to the salmon returns and making sure that we are seeing it last for years to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369660">I am glad to say that my department is currently reviewing information to support the decision-making on potential expansion of the mark-selective fishery. There are vital concerns that need to be thoroughly understood, though. For instance, the mark-selective fisheries will still encounter wild Chinook. Release mortalities of stock concern needs to be accounted for to ensure that the mark-selective fisheries do not adversely impact the wild stocks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369661">I have been speaking with sports fishers in B.C., as well as environmental organizations. I have heard how a mark-selective fishery can offer potential benefits. I fully want to make sure that we continue to speak to these organizations to fully understand the issues of the potential, but we also need to know what we need to do to mitigate the concerns that we are also hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369662">To do this work, DFO is going to undertake additional consultations to further inform our decision-making and we will do everything we can to work with these communities to address the concerns that we are hearing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369674">Madam Chair, people sometimes forget the essential role that maritime fisheries played in the development of Quebec. It was through fishing, among other things, that Europeans first met first nations peoples. Even today, the sea is a crossroads where people meet up, rub shoulders and exchange ideas, but also where they sometimes clash. It was actually to secure control of the fishery that Great Britain and France fought during the colonial era, and it is unfortunately for that reason that some communities remain divided, even today, in the Maritimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369675">In the past, this sector has also been the subject of federal-provincial bickering. On that front, no one will be surprised to hear me say that nothing is settled. In Quebec, fishing plays a fundamental role in the economic and social life of many communities in the Gaspé region, the Magdalen Islands, the Lower St. Lawrence, as well as in my home region, the North Shore, and in northern Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369676">In 2018 the maritime fisheries represented more than 4,500 direct and indirect jobs and generated revenues totalling more than $435 million for the Quebec economy. For many indigenous communities, such as the Innu, Maliseet and Mi'kmaq nations, the fisheries offer economic development opportunities that enable them to envisage a better future based on activities historically practised by those nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369677">Fishing is a tangible reality that has been neglected for far too long by successive governments, resulting in the consequences we are familiar with and continue to experience. I am therefore taking this opportunity to outline the approach to marine fisheries that my party, the Bloc Québécois, intends to defend, because we can and we must do better for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369678">As members surely know, fishing is a shared jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867. The conservation, regulation and protection of the resource are the federal government's responsibility, while the processing of seafood products and the ownership of the resource are Quebec's responsibility. As the former leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, so ably put it, when the fish is in the water, it is managed by the federal government, and when it is out of the water, it belongs to Quebec. If it comes out head first, it belongs to Quebec; if it comes out tail first, it belongs to the federal government. I would add that when it arrives at the processing plant, it returns to Quebec's jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369679">The result of this division of powers is the worst part of Canadian federalism, in other words inconsistency in public policy. As hon. members know, Quebec's motto is <I>Je me souviens</I>, or I remember. Nonetheless, memory can sometimes play tricks on us and even make us forget. In time, we end up taking certain things for granted. The federal government's hegemony over fisheries management is one such thing. History shows us that this was not always that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369680">Did hon. members know that for 62 years, the Government of Quebec was in charge of issuing fishing licences, enforcing the law, establishing the rules and developing other salt water fishing activities? Did hon. members know that for nearly 55 years, that management went off without a hitch under a Quebec-Canada agreement signed in 1922?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369681">Did hon. members know that in July 1983, the government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau unilaterally decided to end this Quebec-Canada agreement, thereby sparking another quarrel with Quebec? Let's not forget that. On the contrary, let's remember.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369682">Did hon. members know that the traditional position of the Government of Quebec, reiterated by several successive governments since 1936, is that the provinces should have exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries in their territory? Very few people know that. The Bloc Québécois knows it, and our position on this matter is the same as Quebec's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369683">By terminating the 1922 agreement, Ottawa did two things. First, it demonstrated predatory federalism by taking away a tool that empowered Quebec to pursue vigorous development of its marine fisheries. Second, it reinforced the inconsistency in public policy. The two sectors are necessarily interdependent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369782">Madam Chair, I am very proud of the work we have done at Big Bar. It has been a trigovernment approach. We have implemented a number of measures to make sure salmon are able to traverse the river. We are currently in the process of creating a natural fish passway. These are all things that have to be done, because we know how important the salmon are in the Fraser River.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369783">Madam Chair, I am thankful for the opportunity to contribute to today's discussion at this gathering of the committee of the whole. I have about nine or 10 minutes of comments and then I will proceed to questions at the end of my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369784">As the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has indicated, the funding we are seeking relates to our government's priorities of promoting economic opportunities for all Canadians, advancing reconciliation with indigenous people, strengthening environmental protections and making sure our waters are safe and navigable. Our government is focused on not just protecting the environment, but restoring it for the benefit of future generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369785">We know that the foundation of a strong economy can only be built with a clean and thriving environment. In fact, there is no better demonstration of how the economy and the environment go hand in hand than our wild Pacific salmon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369786">Serving and restoring Pacific salmon and ensuring a stable and predictable fishery for all participants, both indigenous and non-indigenous, is a responsibility we take very seriously. In many rural and coastal communities, salmon fisheries are a real economic driver that generate jobs and opportunities for thousands of Canadians. Salmon fisheries are part of the cultural identity of the province of British Columbia and play a critical role in building coastal indigenous economies, enabling indigenous groups to develop improved capacity for self-governance and self-determination. To many of our indigenous communities, wild Pacific salmon are not just an economic opportunity, but a way of life that is an important, if not sacred, tradition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369787">Our government is committed to working with indigenous peoples to explore opportunities to further recognize rights and advance reconciliation in the context of fisheries, oceans, aquatic habitats and marine waterways. Canada's wild salmon policies speak to the importance of maintaining the biodiversity of these important stocks, as well as their significance to commercial and recreational fish harvesters, indigenous peoples and, really, all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369788">We have collaborated closely on the creation of a $142-million B.C. salmon restoration and innovation fund, a federal-provincial cost-shared program funded jointly with the Government of British Columbia. We have made an additional contribution of $5 million to the Pacific salmon endowment fund to support the Pacific Salmon Foundation, which is doing incredible work to restore wild Pacific salmon and its habitat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369789">We announced $15 million in additional annual funding to support stock assessments, wire tagging and catch monitoring. These investments contribute to our obligations under the Canada-U.S. Pacific Salmon Treaty and are targeted toward better managing west coast salmon fishing. We are investing $107 million to support the sustainability of Canada's major fish stocks through implementation of the renewed Fisheries Act. We have also invested significant resources in restoring natural passage on the Fraser River after the devastating Big Bar landslide, and we are committed to transitioning from open net-pen finfish aquaculture on the west coast of Canada. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="05">(2005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369795">We are making difficult decisions and important investments today to ensure that Pacific salmon are available for future generations. With many wild salmon stocks at historic lows, it is only with the dedication of all members of this chamber that we will be able to ensure that these populations are able to return to traditional levels of abundance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369796">Of course, wild salmon do not live in a bubble. They, like all of the ocean's creatures, are affected significantly by the cumulative effects of human activity. This means that we must fight not only for our salmon, but for biodiversity itself and for the health of the marine environment in its entirety. Ensuring a healthy ocean is essential for Canada's long-term economic prosperity and will play an important role as we build our economy following this global pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369797">As fellow parliamentarians know, the United Nations has proclaimed a Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, beginning in 2021. Our government has pledged Canada's support, with major investments dedicated to the planning, promotion and coordination of activities related to this decade. Canada must be a leader in this space, as our nation has the longest coastline in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369798">Starting in 2015, as a nation, we had only protected less than 1% of our marine environment, which was completely unacceptable. We pledged to increase this to more than 10% by 2020. Thanks to the hard work of Canadians, we not only met this target but exceeded it. Canada has now protected approximately 14% of our marine environment, and we will get to 25% by 2025. This means that in 10 short years, we will have protected 25 times more ocean marine habitat than all governments before us since Confederation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369799">This is a significant achievement that all members of the House and all Canadians should be proud of. It is a major investment in the future of our country and the future of our planet. However, we intend to go further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369800">This summer, Canada joins the United Kingdom's Global Ocean Alliance to support the adoption of a global target of 30% marine conservation by 2030, which is anticipated to be a key pillar of next year's Convention on Biological Diversity's COP 15 meeting. We are also implementing the commitments we made during Canada's 2018 G7 presidency to shape international efforts to clean up the oceans, tackle oceans plastics and advance ocean observation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369801">We know that just like fighting climate change, protecting and restoring our ocean is an existential necessity. Canada needs to continue to take a leadership role on this and other global environmental issues. We will champion ocean science to help counter threats to ocean life and health, and we must advance a strategy to end illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We do this not just for environmental necessity, but because growing the blue economy is a significant economic opportunity for the entire country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369802">New, sustainable technologies are going to present increasing opportunities to coastal communities. Our commitment to transition away from open net-pen fish farms on the west coast of this country speaks to that sustainable opportunity. British Columbians feel strongly about the health of our fish stocks, and they need to transition farms in a way that is workable, economically feasible and takes into account social impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369803">A change like this requires close collaboration with the Province of British Columbia, indigenous communities, industry and other stakeholders, and I am excited to help build this reasonable path. The timing of this transition is beneficial not only to our wild salmon stocks and marine biodiversity, but to opening our imaginations for what the future of aquaculture can look like in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369804"> Aquaculture goes far beyond salmon. I had the opportunity to visit an oyster farm in Prince Edward Island, which not only creates delicious oysters, but effectively cleans the oceans while doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369805">Companies and communities across Canada are already leading the world in aquaculture in areas that include fish, seaweed and shellfish. It is a core part of our blue economy growth strategy and strengthens the need for the legislative and economic certainty that a dedicated aquaculture act can provide, an act I expect we will be debating in the House in the next number of months. Such an act would bring clarity and transparency to Canadians as to how aquaculture will be managed in order to achieve responsible and sustainable growth. </ParaText>

Of course, I am referring to the brave men and women who serve in the Canadian Coast Guard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369807">Last year, our government announced the single-largest investment ever made to renew the Canadian Coast Guard fleet, with up to 18 new large ships, the construction of six new icebreakers and an additional $2 billion in investments for vessel life-extension maintenance and repair work for the existing fleet. These ships are being built through Canada's national shipbuilding strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369808">Our offshore fisheries science vessels were Canada's first-ever vessels purposely designed and built for vital offshore fisheries research science and monitoring. These vessels were constructed at Seaspan shipyards, a world leader in shipbuilding, whose facility happens to be in my own backyard. Many of my constituents are directly employed at Seaspan and my entire constituency, indeed the entire country, benefits from their world-class work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369809">We are ensuring that the Coast Guard has the safe, reliable and modern equipment needed to carry out important work, such as icebreaking operations, search and rescue, and environmental response, all while creating good jobs and economic opportunities that will extend across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369810">I value deeply the wealth of experience my fellow parliamentarians bring to the House. It is an honour to rise today and discuss some of the great work we are doing and even more so to express that we are doing this in collaboration with members on all sides of the House for the good of all Canadians and for the benefit, most important, of future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369811">As members know, Canada has the largest amount of coastline of any nation in the world.

              <ParaText id="6369882">Madam Chair, I will begin my 15 minutes of questions with the minister on the issue of the moderate livelihood fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369883">Obviously, in Nova Scotia in recent months, this issue has been the subject of much coverage and controversy. When I speak with those who are members of indigenous communities who want to exercise their right to a moderate livelihood, it is clear that they rely on the law we adopted in Canada in the treaties of the 1760s. Of course, the right was embedded more fully and with some more clarity in the Marshall decision of the late nineties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369884">One of the things I find to be a major source of frustration is that when I talk to people independently, either indigenous fishers or commercial fishers, a lot of them want the same things. They have grown accustomed to fishing alongside one another. They both, for the most part, recognize the existence of the right to take part in a moderate livelihood fishery. I find it frustrating because my career before politics was in litigation, where two sides would come together completely in disagreement on virtually everything, yet we would often come to a resolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369885">In the present instance, I hear that there is an appetite to recognize a moderate livelihood, but it is peppered with fears. There are sincerely held fears among commercial fishers about the ability to practise their fishery, because they are worried about the conservation outcomes that may arise if there is increased effort placed on the fishery. They are subject to rules that have been built up over decades. There are people in my office saying that they want to support increased participation among indigenous fishers, but they are worried for their livelihoods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369886">I am curious if the minister can offer some comfort or commentary around the subject of conservation and the importance that she, as minister, will place on that very important principle as any kind of a framework is developed to implement the right to a moderate livelihood.</ParaText>

We put some pretty stringent measures in place this year and I am happy to say there were no entanglements of right whales in Atlantic Canada. That was extremely beneficial. We know it has been a challenge for a number of our coastal fishermen, but this is something we have developed in collaboration with them. We are going to continue to work with them this year to see what happens and how we can best move forward addressing their concerns.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6369971">I am happy to be here tonight to talk about some of the important investments that this government is making in our communities when it comes to supporting our fisheries and coastal areas, especially those in my riding. In Cape Breton—Canso, the hard-working women and men who make up our fisheries support rural and coastal communities. Their catches end up on tables across Canada, providing Canadians with high-quality, sustainable seafood, year-round.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369972">We have heard tonight that fisheries are the backbone of many of our rural communities. We understand how important it is that our ocean environment is protected in order to support healthy, productive fisheries. That is why it is critically important to make investments that will support communities in accessing shared ocean resources and spur innovation as we deal with impacts due to climate change and ocean pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369973">I would like to talk about a few of the DFO investments that are particularly important in communities across my riding of Cape Breton—Canso. I would like to start with small craft harbours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369974">Investments in infrastructure are critical to economic development in rural communities. That includes marine infrastructure. Here in Cape Breton—Canso, marine infrastructure is vital to so many of our small communities that rely on the ocean for their livelihoods. Our government knows this. That is why, since 2016, there has been about $484 million invested in new funding for the small craft harbours program. This is on top of the program's ongoing regular annual budget of $90 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369975">This represents more than 800 projects that are instrumental in keeping commercial fishing harbours safe and accessible for the benefit of coastal communities across this great country. These investments have supported the growth of coastal communities across Canada, but we cannot stop there. We need to continue to make these critical investments that will keep rural and coastal communities resilient, especially now during these unprecedented times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369976">I would like to focus now just a little on the Atlantic fisheries fund. Like small craft harbours, the government is committed to promoting innovation in the fish and seafood sector. That is why in March of 2017, $325 million was invested in the Atlantic fisheries fund. This fund allows the seafood sector even more future success by supporting market entry and growth, creating jobs and of course supporting coastal communities that rely on the marine economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369977">This federal-provincial joint funding program has been used to acquire state-of-the-art processing equipment, implement innovative processes for automation, improve infrastructure and other projects that will generate great opportunities for the sector. This fund has supported many projects in my riding, focusing on the expansion of operations at various seafood processing centres like Louisbourg Seafoods in Canso, allowing them to reach markets around the world and, in turn, making a substantial investment to our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369978">In addition to the investments in the Atlantic fisheries fund and small craft harbours, our government also understands the importance of investing in clean technology, which is why, in 2017, $20 million was invested directly into clean technology for the industry. This program will help protect our environment while developing sustainable fisheries. It will also accelerate the use of sustainable and more efficient tools, practices and techniques in producing and harvesting Canadian seafood. I am happy that our government will continue to promote sustainable and inclusive growth for the middle class and that we are committed to protecting our oceans and marine resources for future generations of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369979">I would also like to spend a little time just talking about the measures this government has taken when it comes to combatting marine plastic pollution. It is the end of 2020 and we are entering 2021. We know now, more than ever, that we need to do our part to keep our environment clean of plastics and other pollution. This is especially true for our oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369980">Canada has shown leadership on innovation in fisheries, including industry-led initiatives addressing ghost gear and, for our whales, safe gear technology. Marine litter, particular ghost fishing gear, is one of the biggest threats to our oceans. I was proud to see that earlier this year, DFO hosted the first international Gear Innovation Summit to focus on important areas of industry innovation. This summit provided an opportunity for harvesters, technical experts, non-governmental officials and government agencies to share information and learn about innovative technologies and programming aimed at the prevention, reduction and retrieval of ghost gear, and reduce the impact of fishery activities on mammals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369981">During 2018, at the G7 meeting in Halifax, Canada strengthened its domestic and international commitment to address marine litter by signing on to the Global Ghost Gear Initiative. As a signatory to this initiative, our government is committed to improving the health of marine ecosystems, safeguarding human health and livelihoods and protecting marine life from harm.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="05">(2105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6369982">The new ghost gear fund is one of the many actions announced under the strategy of zero plastic waste by this government to combat plastic waste in the environment, and it supports our commitment to the ocean plastics charter. This $8.3-million investment will assist indigenous groups, fish harvesters, the aquaculture industry, non-profits and communities to take concrete actions to support ghost gear prevention, retrieval and responsible disposal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369983">It will also support fish harvesters to acquire new gear technologies to reduce gear loss. This fund was identified by the Global Ghost Gear Initiative as the first time a national government has dedicated a specific funding program entirely to domestic and international ghost gear prevention and mitigation strategies. It is thanks to strategies like these that our government will be able to achieve its goals announced last week, the net zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369984">There is always more work to be done and we know this, but Canadians can count on this government to protect our environment, whether it is on the land or in the waters. We are making real investments to ensure that our environment will remain healthy for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369985">I would like to take the rest of my time to ask some questions of the hon. minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369986">The Department of Fisheries and Oceans does important work in every corner of my diverse riding around small craft harbours, as I just mentioned, whether it is working with harvesters in Chéticamp to support their livelihood or working with residents in L'Ardoise to explore ways to improve their community's environment. The work of this department is so critical and so greatly appreciated in my riding. Again, small craft harbours provide support to the commercial fishing industry, and we are indebted to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6369987">The small craft harbour program keeps the harbours that are critical to the fishing industry open and in good repair.

              <ParaText id="6370131">I was not able to talk about Quebec's port facilities in committee. As the minister surely knows, many communities in Quebec and in my north shore riding have no road connecting them to the rest of the world or the continent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370132">Be it the Magdalen Islands, the iconic Anticosti Island or the lower north shore that borders Labrador, port facilities are central to the history and the economic and social development of these communities and to the lives of first nations. In short, we evolved in symbiosis with the St. Lawrence River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370133">The minister probably also knows that the Premier of Quebec is very interested in port facilities. In his book entitled <I>Cap sur un Québec gagnant</I>, François Legault wrote that Quebec needs to be able to count on the federal government to take on its share of responsibility, especially when it comes to wharf maintenance, which falls under federal jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370134">According to Mr. Legault, the federal government's disengagement in recent years has rendered the situation completely unacceptable. Some wharves have become so dilapidated that they no longer meet the needs of recreational boaters, even though those wharves are an important part of the economy and very identity of towns and villages along the river. Unless this situation is remedied, it could cost Quebec dearly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6370152">Madam Chair, indeed, there are many, many communities that need attention. There are nearly 100 wharves in eastern Quebec. I talked about economic development, which is being undermined, as well as the future of first nations communities and land use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370153">I talked about Natashquan, where there was no road at one point. There is also Baie-Johan-Beetz, which is in a similar situation. Transport Canada tells us that these wharves are no longer in use because there is now a road in some places. Traffic is no longer by sea but by land. However, these wharves have always been used by fishers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370154">I could also cite the example of Sacré-Cœur. I want to talk about all the hardships that our small coastal communities come up against. Villages of 200 to 300 people have these infrastructures and want to keep them. They would like them to be modernized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370155">A wharf in Sacré-Cœur that was divested several years ago is being modernized. The certificate of authorization was valid, but the village had to wait 18 days to start the work because of a delay in obtaining a signature that was caused by the department. This resulted in $100,000 in additional costs that had to be paid by a population of a few hundred people. This completely compromised the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370156">I live on Quebec's North Shore, where winter lasts almost six months. This means that the work schedule, despite the Department of Fisheries and Oceans calendar, does not work for our municipalities. This jeopardizes projects.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6370179">I have been listening to the discussion tonight and a lot of it focuses around the Marshall decision when we are talking about moderate livelihoods. Some will talk about it as Marshall one or Marshall two. To many MPs and people around Canada, it is just a name on a piece of paper or the title of a case, nothing more, nothing less. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370180">However, as the only Mi'kmaq who has ever sat in the House, I think it is important to give context on who Donald Marshall Jr. was. To the Mi'kmaq, there is much more to this. We know the man. I can think of his smile right now and his moustache and the bell cap he usually wore out and about in Cape Breton. He was known as “Junior” to most of the Mi'kmaq because his father was the grand chief of the Mi'kmaq nation for 27 years, until his peaceful death in 1991.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370181">I remember as a young child listening to Donald Marshall Jr. when he went to classrooms to talk about his fight to change the justice system, after spending 11 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Donald Marshall Jr. spoke to Mi'kmaq youth at youth conferences about his personal views of justice and what he endured. He taught about resilience and that each one of us has a responsibility to fight for justice, whether in a courtroom, at home or even in jail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370182">I remember watching a movie at a very young age called <I>Justice Denied</I> that talked about his story and his fight for justice. We often ask in Nova Scotia how this could happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370183">It was the focus of a provincial commission, the “Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr. Prosecution”, which found, on page 1, “The criminal justice system failed Donald Marshall Jr. at...every turn from his arrest and his wrongful conviction” in 1971. It called it a “miscarriage of justice”. It stated that the reason was, at least in part, because Donald Marshall Jr. was indigenous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370184">Despite all he had gone through, just four years after his commission, Junior was fighting for justice again, but this time on behalf of a nation. After years of litigation, the Mi'kmaq who had validated their treaties at the Supreme Court case in 1985 now turned to Donald Marshall Jr. for the most important litigation the nation had ever been a part of. Unlike any other case, it was not about surviving but thriving as a nation. It was a court case about a Mi'kmaq person being able to move from poverty to a moderate or modest living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370185">Elder Kerry Prosper, a chief then, described it as a win for our nation. It was the first time many chiefs felt a collective win as a nation. Unfortunately, the jubilation for the Mi'kmaq and Junior was brief. Only two months later, our Supreme Court of Canada, based on political and economic pressures, decided to clarify this decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370186">As far as I know in my academic career and legal knowledge, I can point to no other Supreme Court of Canada case that has ever needed clarification. I can only imagine what Donald Marshall Jr. went through and what it must have felt like to hear his victory on behalf of the nation required an unprecedented clarification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370187">In both cases the facts were the same and the verdict was the same, which was that Donald Marshall Jr. caught and sold eels out of season and was protected by a Mi'kmaq treaty right to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370188">Donald Marshall Jr. passed away a hero in 2009, a hero to his nation. I felt it was important to give this context to the legacy we are dealing with when we speak of the Marshall decision. I am only sad that Junior died before seeing his home community of Membertou become one of the owners of the largest fisheries company in this country. I congratulate his home community, Chief Terry Paul of Membertou and its council for making sure Junior's legacy will always be a positive one.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, understanding the Marshall decision requires understanding indigenous case law from 1929 until today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370190">Understanding the Marshall decision requires understanding the Constitution of Canada, specifically section 35, which recognizes and affirms all existing aboriginal and treaty rights, as well as section 52, which states: “The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with...the Constitution is...of no force or effect.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370191">I wanted to give that context because I thought it was important for the Mi'kmaq, and for the House of Commons, to understand that when Marshall decisions 1 or 2 are talked about, it means a lot to the Mi'kmaq people because he was one of our heroes.

They fish alongside all other fishermen during the seasons and have done so successfully for a number of years. I can think of Crane Cove fisheries as one of them that, in my home community, employs close to 100 fishermen who are part of this group.</ParaText>

My mother and her four or five sisters all, at one point in their lives, worked at a cannery, whether it was B.C. Packers or J.S. McMillan Fisheries or the co-op fisheries. Prince Rupert is known as the capital of halibut, as one sees when one drives into the town.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370276">I have very many fond memories. I actually worked at a cannery growing up, and on the weekends my family would go out for a picnic along the Skeena River and go fishing for chum, sockeye, spring salmon or coho, and sometimes trout. It would be a very fascinating time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370277">I would like to echo some of the things that the minister has spoken about today, and let Canadians know about some of the great work that is being done at Fisheries and Oceans under the minister and this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370278">Canadians know that climate change is real and we are witnessing impacts that are directly affecting Canadians and our coastal communities. With the longest coastline in the world, our oceans are home to diverse ecosystems that support not only marine life but Canadians across the country who depend on it. With warming temperatures, we are seeing warming waters and ocean acidification, which is leading to less oxygen in our waters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370279">These changes are threatening the health of the species that live in our waters, including our fisheries, which not only contribute to ocean biodiversity but to our ocean economy. Canada's commercial sea and freshwater fish landings is, on average, over $3.7 billion a year. Catches from our waters end up on dinner tables and in restaurants all across the country and, yes, around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370280">Supporting ocean biodiversity is helping to also support our economy. This is why it is imperative that we continue to invest in ocean protection and work with the provinces and territories with a renewed focus on collaboration to conserve this important resource. This is exactly what our government has been doing from coast to coast to coast. This minister is working with provinces and territories to ensure that our fisheries and oceans remain protected and healthy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370281">I want to first speak to the capacity building at DFO, undertaken by this government after being elected by Canadians, following the major and devastating cuts brought forth by the Conservative Party. When the Conservatives were in power, it was their mission to weaken science, to ignore science and to remove protections from our oceans and fisheries. They believed that by slashing science, this would help with project development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370282"> On this side of the aisle, Liberals believe that we can still put in place strong protections and support industry development. An example of this is the Fisheries Act. In 2018, our government introduced Bill <Document DbId="9630814" Type="3">C-68</Document> to modernize the Fisheries Act and restore lost protections to fish and fish habitat after the Conservative government gutted the act. Even more shameful, the Conservatives did this under the omnibus budget bill so that they could force changes through without due consideration from elected parliamentarians. It was so bad that four former fisheries ministers opposed the changes, two of whom were, notably, Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370283">Let me quote former Conservative minister, the Hon. Tom Siddon, who said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370284">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The real scary part of this is that the one minister in Canada who has the constitutional duty to protect the fishery...is the Fisheries Minister. These amendments essentially parcel out and water down his fiduciary responsibility, to the point that...he can delegate his responsibility to private-sector interests and individuals....</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370285">He also said, “it’s appalling that they should be attempting to do this under the radar.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370286">However, I am proud to say that, in the last year, our government passed the renewed Fisheries Act that restored lost protections that were previously stripped by the Conservatives, and modernized it to include important inshore owner-operator policies, fish-stocking rebuilding provisions and more certainty for industry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="30">(2230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6370287">Not only is the Fisheries Act strengthened when it comes to fish protection, but there is a clear permitting framework for development projects to ensure that industries have the regulations they need to move forward when it comes to large and small projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370288">I would also like to add that our Liberal government introduced further amendments to Bill <Document DbId="9630814" Type="3">C-68</Document> last year, which included a ban on keeping whales in captivity and a ban on shark finning. Both these issues had previously been identified as individual private member's bills that the Conservatives were trying to block. Following royal assent, Canada became the first G7 country to ban shark finning, and that is something that Canadians should be proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370289">On top of making important changes to legislation, our government has been making investments and taking action to build science capacity at DFO. Most Canadians will remember that the former Conservative government made $100 million in cuts to DFO, eliminated 500 jobs, and muzzled scientists. In fact, it even closed seven of DFO's 11 libraries, which contain world-class research, and attempted to close down the Experimental Lakes Area, a facility that boosts leading scientific research regarding freshwater systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370290">Since 2016, our government has hired almost 300 new science staff, and between 2016 and 2021, this government will have invested over $500 million in marine and freshwater science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370291">This is real progress. It is without a doubt that science underpins decision-making at DFO. Investments in science are important in ensuring that we have the information we need to protect our fish stocks, our coastal areas and our marine ecosystems. That is precisely why this Liberal government has made investments in science, not just at DFO, but across departments, a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370292">I also want to touch quickly on marine conservation. Protecting our oceans is important. It not only ensures that we are conserving ecologically significant areas to maintain biodiversity, but supporting marine conservation also means helping keep our fisheries healthy, which supports many of our coastal communities. It is in everyone's interest that we find ways to work with communities to protect our oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370293">Over the last five years under a Liberal government, Canada has protected almost 14% of our marine coastal areas, up from just under 1% under the former Conservative government. Indeed, this is something that Canadians should all be proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370294">I do wish to ask the <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries</Affiliation> a question, going back to the province I was raised in. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans invested heavily to support the migration and improve Pacific salmon stocks. How much has been invested to support British Columbia salmon restoration and innovation? How is this improving Pacific salmon?</ParaText>

I am desperately concerned that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans constructed its review of the threat to wild salmon from the fish farms specifically excluding the parasitic effect of the sea lice that escape and affect wild salmon. It did not take those into consideration. Within the minister's own department, Dr. Kristi Miller has done important work on this, which appears to have been excluded from consideration. </ParaText>

This spring, in consultation with our partners, my department revised the licences of marine aquaculture finfish operators in British Columbia to increase the enforceability of licence conditions pertaining to the management of sea lice.

In many ways, the new Fisheries Act is a solid step forward, but the government has been slow to operationalize the policies and regulations that are so important to the objectives set out in the act.</ParaText>

We know there are some good players, but there are some bad players in that sector as well. DFO's relationship with the shellfish aquaculture industry is a stunning example of industry capture where input from science, federal and provincial commissions, and environment advocates has been totally ignored over the past 18 years. Practices and certain players in that industry have been allowed to degrade the marine environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6370353">The people of Denman and Hornby Islands, and Baynes Sound where I live, are calling for changes to the conditions of licensing for shellfish aquaculture regulations. They need this to happen. The impact of unchecked intensification without proper monitoring or enforcement of environmental impact on aquaculture and vital ecosystems has resulted in continued intensification and proliferation of industrial aquaculture, which has been destructive to the ecosystems that sustain the health of our region. They are calling for the government to use the guidelines of the aquaculture sustainability council. Will the minister do that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6370355">Mr. Chair, herring is a vital source of the ecosystem. It is the bedrock. It is the forage fish for our ecosystem that wild salmon, cod, halibut, shorebirds and mammals rely on. We have seen a decline in herring on the west coast and right now the only open area of the six herring grounds is in the Salish Sea. We have seen the decline of 129,000 tonnes of biomass just in four years to a predicted 58,000 next year. The government said it relies on indigenous and local knowledge, but the first nations have been asking for it to be curtailed or shut down, and so have local communities. Will the minister do the right thing and curtail the herring sector or shut it down until a whole-of-ecosystem management plan is in place?</ParaText>
