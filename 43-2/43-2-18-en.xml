              <ParaText id="6300138"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by acknowledging that the House sits on the traditional territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300139">It is a great honour to rise today and speak to Bill <Document DbId="10870098" Type="3">C-5</Document>, an important bill that seeks to create a new federal statutory holiday, a national day for truth and reconciliation. It is important that we recognize and thank Georgina Jolibois for bringing this bill forward in the last Parliament, but more importantly for being a strong advocate for indigenous rights and a voice for indigenous peoples not only in her riding, but across all of Canada. I also want to thank and acknowledge the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> for supporting this important piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300140">I have had the honour to speak in the House on our country's path toward reconciliation, and I know that reconciliation does not belong to a single political party or single individual. It is a shared responsibility for each and every one of us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6300141">This bill is an important step on the journey that we are taking together. I am proud to work with members of all political parties on this legislative measure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300142">Some members of the House may have had the privilege of hearing the testimony given before the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage when it examined Georgina Jolibois's bill in the previous Parliament. The testimony we heard strengthened our conviction that it is important to pass this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300143">Much of that moving and powerful testimony focused on the potential benefits of a national day for truth and reconciliation. For example, National Chief Robert Bertrand of the Congress for Aboriginal Peoples said: </ParaText>

This would be a marked departure from that legacy.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6300151">Mr. Obed's first point speaks to the importance and status of national holidays in Canada, and I would like to remind this chamber that the act of creating a new statutory holiday is, in itself, quite significant. Right now there are nine federally legislated statutory holidays in Canada. A national day for truth and reconciliation would join in rank of importance with holidays like Labour Day and Remembrance Day, highlighting the significance and scope of this day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300152">During the testimony we heard, many groups expressed points of view similar to those I just quoted about the meaning and impact of a day of commemoration.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6300153">The residential school system was indeed a national tragedy. Over the span of 130 years, more than 150,000 first nations, Inuit and Métis children were placed in residential schools. These children were forcibly separated from their parents, their homes, their culture, their language, their land, their relations and their communities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6300154">This day is important. It is an opportunity to reflect on the harm inflicted on first nations, Inuit and Métis peoples throughout our history and to this day by the legacy of residential schools. We are working to repair that harm by responding the the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's calls to action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300155">Call to action number 80 calls upon our government to:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> establish, as a statutory holiday, a National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to honour Survivors, their families, and communities, and ensure that public commemoration of the history and legacy of residential schools remains a vital component of the reconciliation process.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6300158">After careful consultations and respectful consideration, September 30 was the date chosen deliberately for its significance. Currently, September 30 is the date of the grassroots movement called Orange Shirt Day, started by the formidable Phyllis Webstad. It was named after the orange shirt that Mrs. Webstad was given by her grandmother on her first day of residential school, only to have it forcibly taken away from her upon her arrival. Her orange shirt is symbolic of the vibrant cultures, languages, traditions, identities and childhoods that were repressed within the residential school system. It is also a symbol of survivors like Phyllis and the monumental efforts by first nations, Inuit and Métis in protecting and revitalizing their cultures and languages for future generations.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6300159">From testimony in committee we learned that September is a symbolically painful time for indigenous families and communities. Every year during the month of September children were separated from their loved ones and their community to go back to school. It is important to acknowledge this pain with a solemn day to remember the past, reflect on it and learn together to gain a better knowledge of the history and legacy of residential schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300160">It has always been my belief that one of the pillars of reconciliation is education. Establishing a national day for truth and reconciliation is education in action. For all those living in Canada, this would be a day of commemoration, but also a day to learn about a dark chapter of our past. It would serve as a reminder to never forget and never veer from the path toward reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300161">Students still go back to school every year in September. The proposed date, September 30, for a national day of truth and reconciliation not only has symbolic importance, but it also provides an opportunity for learning within our schools about our journey toward reconciliation. Teachers across the country will be able to build on discussions about residential schools that are already under way in many schools. Families will have a reason to talk about reconciliation at home. Canadians will have a day to reflect on our history and our values as a society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300162">I like to think about the day when schools across the country will mark this holiday with ceremonies, as a day of learning. I hope they will invite elders or survivors, indigenous knowledge holders and educators to come into classrooms to talk with the children.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6300163">I think of the way that schools across the country use Remembrance Day as an educational tool for children of all ages to learn about the historic conflicts that Canada has been involved in, to understand the horrors of war and, above all, to honour the women and men who have sacrificed so much in serving this country. I believe that a new day for truth and reconciliation is an excellent learning opportunity for this equally important part of Canada's history.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300164">Unfortunately, only half of Canadians know the history of the Indian residential school system and its long-term effects on indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300165"> The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada states that too many Canadians know little or nothing about the the deep historical roots of these conflicts. This lack of historical knowledge has serious consequences for first nations, Inuit and Métis peoples, and for Canada as a whole. Setting aside a special day each year to take the time to acknowledge this painful history will help everyone learn and understand more about the realities of the residential school era. This is a positive step on our path toward reconciliation. This type of commemoration is a collective, public act of recognition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300166">This will also be a day of listening and healing for the entire country. Together we can continue our conversation on social justice.</ParaText>

We don't just talk about wars; we talk about peace in the context of talking about wars. In the context of residential schools, we can talk about mistakes of the past and what we are trying to do to address things going forward.</QuotePara>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I think there's a way of achieving that balance where the focus of a day could be a focus on the past human rights abuses that indigenous peoples have experienced and have worked to overcome. At the same time, it could be the day to focus on the agency that we all have to take positive actions to address some of the challenges that flow from those past experiences.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6300171">I want to underscore that reconciliation and advancing indigenous rights remain a constant priority for our government. Some people will say that a single day will not resolve the horrors of the past and will do nothing to improve the unacceptable living conditions that still exist in some communities to this day. I believe, however, that remembering the past is an effective way to ensure that history is not repeated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300172">Systemic racism and overt racism exist in Canada. They are not and will never be acceptable. Recently, we were reminded of the horrific consequences they can have. The events that preceded the death of Joyce Echaquan shocked us all. They outraged us, but should not surprise us. They are not isolated events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300173">Addressing systemic racism in all our institutions requires active listening, strong public policy and making more equitable representation at all levels of society. Honouring the victims of institutional racism, whatever form it may have taken throughout history, is a first step. Making sure that these atrocities against indigenous peoples cease completely is our everyday priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300174"> This national day for truth and reconciliation will be an opportunity for Canadians to reflect on and question their own individual biases and assumptions. Working on them will require a continuous and collective endeavour beyond September 30.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6300175">I implore members of the House to listen carefully to the testimony of the survivors and indigenous leaders who are telling us how a national day of recognition would help heal the wounds of the past, honour survivors and move forward together towards reconciliation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300176">We must also continue to work tirelessly to quickly resolve the many problems faced by indigenous communities today. Access to drinking water, for example, is vital. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300177">Our government is committed to eliminating all boil water advisories, in the long term, in first nations communities living on reserve. We recognize and affirm the right of communities to have access to safe drinking water. As a result of this commitment, 95 boil water advisories have been lifted since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300178">In the preceding parliament, we passed an important law to reform child and family services with the goal of reducing the number of indigenous children in care. The law also allows first nations, the Inuit and the Métis to have full authority over child services so they can make the decisions that will ensure the well-being of their children, families and communities. There is a crisis in indigenous communities. Too many children are taken away from their homes and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300179"> We are also committed to the reclamation, revitalization and strengthening of indigenous languages. A historic piece of legislation, the Indigenous Languages Act, received royal assent on June 21, 2019. This legislation was developed in collaboration with indigenous peoples. It recognizes the language rights of indigenous peoples and sets out how we will support these languages.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300180">Canadian Heritage is working collaboratively with indigenous partners to implement the Indigenous Languages Act. The department is consulting with indigenous governments, governing bodies and a variety of organizations on the appointment of a commissioner and three directors of indigenous languages, as well as the development of an indigenous languages funding model. These are important successes, yet we can all agree that there is so much more we need to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300183">In introducing this bill to create a national day for truth and reconciliation, the Government of Canada is hoping to encourage people across the country to learn about indigenous history, come together and get involved to support these efforts and help their communities move forward on the path to reconciliation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300186">We must recognize that others have come before us to chart this path. The commissioners of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission gave so much of themselves to ensure that the voices of others were heard. Those who testified, leaders and indigenous communities across Canada, as well as current and former parliamentarians, including Georgina Jolibois, called for a national day, as is set out in this bill.

              <ParaText id="6300204">The <Affiliation DbId="253406" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> quite rightly points out the need for education because so many Canadians are unaware of this dark chapter in our history.

On Remembrance Day, the federal government and schools and everybody really put an effort forward to allow young people and all Canadians to learn about these tragic parts of our history. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300219">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to be here. Imagine living beside a home for years and knowing the families who went through there, only to find out, after growing up and moving away, that unspeakable horrors took place in that house. Members should put themselves in that position right now, because for me, that is what we are talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300220">Orange Shirt Day originated in my hometown of Williams Lake. St. Joseph's Mission was just down the road from where I grew up. I played ball hockey there. I swam there. Later in life, I rode motorbikes, played in the fields and rode horses through there. I played with many of the kids. I know many of the kids who came through there. Orange Shirt Day for me, every year, strikes home the fact that we never know exactly what is going on right beside us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300221">Over the years I have gotten to know a number of survivors of the residential school program. They tell horrific stories. My wife and my children are from the Esdilagh First Nation. One of my dear friends and mentors, even though he is younger, is Chief Willie Sellars of the Williams Lake Indian Band. St. Joseph's Mission and the remnants of the mission still reside in their community. As people drive by it, every day, it is a constant reminder of the atrocities that took place right there. That is what Orange Shirt Day means to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300222">In the House we were talking about Remembrance Day and the significance of remembering, every day, those who serve our country and our community. It is not enough for us to use one day to remember their service. We have to remember it every day. Orange Shirt Day, for me and for many, is similar: Every day we must remember these atrocities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300223">We have to understand our past. We currently live in an era of a cancel culture. We want to erase all this: Tear down statues and erase the past. What we need is to remember our past. Without our past, we do not know where we have been. Without our past, we have no idea who we are today. Without our past, we do not know where we are going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300224">I had the honour of speaking during debate on the Indigenous Languages Act. I spoke of an elder in my riding, Lheidli T'enneh elder Mary Gouchie, who was one of the last speakers of the Dakelh language in my riding. I had the honour of being with her and sitting with her, and she would share stories with me. She instilled in me that our past is so important. Culture is so important, and knowing one's culture. As I said, my children, my son and my daughter, are first nations, yet they have very little knowledge of their past or their history. I think that is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300225">I mentioned my friend, Chief Willie Sellars. He is a mentor who is leading his community to overcome its challenges and to learn from the mistakes of the past. He is leading them to greater opportunities moving forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300227">Orange Shirt Day is the story of Phyllis Jack. Her grandmother took her to a store and bought her a nice orange shirt for her first day of school. She went on the bus to St. Joseph's Mission, and immediately upon arriving on the mission grounds, she had that orange shirt ripped off of her. The residential school program was designed to eradicate the race: the first nation, or the native, in those children. Over 150,000 first nations, Inuit and Métis children went through that program, and so many did not make it out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300228"> September 30 is a day to honour the survivors: those who came through the program. It is also to remember those who did not make it through. My colleague had a great question for the minister about the teaching of this subject. My worry with the program is that it becomes just another excuse for a holiday. I will go back to my earlier comments: Imagine living beside a house of horrors. We should never forget. We need to learn from that past and ensure that it never happens again. The orange shirt slogan is that every child matters. We need to ensure that we are bringing equity up so that every child truly does matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300229">I think we use reconciliation like a buzzword at times. We have seen it with certain programs and policies that have taken place. We have seen that we still have boil water advisories in first nations. I will be the first to admit those boil water advisories have been longstanding and that no one case is the same as another. It is not one-size-fits-all. It is very complex, but we have to work to be better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300230">We have suicide epidemics, where children as young as four years old are choosing death to get out of their lot in life. One of the first emergency debates that I took part in, in the House, was regarding the Attawapiskat First Nation suicide epidemic. Sadly, today we still have those same concerns and those same challenges are taking place. Reconciliation is about walking a path together, not pitting one first nation against another first nation, picking winners or losers, or pitting first nations against non-first nations. If we are truly devoted and committed to reconciliation, it is about working together and learning from one another.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300231">I spoke to a couple of first nations leaders about my speech today. They have heard me talk before. They have heard my comments about reconciliation being more than a buzzword: more than something for a politician to stand with hand on heart and perhaps a tissue in hand to dab away a fake tear and say, “This is my most important relationship,” while we still have communities that have boil water advisories and that suffer atrocious living conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300232">If we are truly going to walk the path, we have to educate. We cannot develop indigenous policy without indigenous people at the table. We cannot chart a path forward unless we have honest conversation, and honest conversation means we are not always going to agree. In my riding of Cariboo—Prince George, an area that I grew up running through, and fishing, hunting and hiking in, belongs to the Tsilhqot’in Nation, where the Supreme Court decision in the William case took place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300233">We have challenges with first nations and non-first-nations people who have lived side by side for generations. It is a delicate balance for me always, because I have friends and relations on both sides. We always have to remember that the path forward is through honest conversation and education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300234"> Phyllis Jack, in writing and telling her story, hoped that it would spur a movement and that it would help to educate people. The conversation that we are having today on this, and that we have had over the last number of years, is so important. Our shared history, our connection to our past, is often immediate. The way we understand our heritage is passed down, for the most part, through books, memories and communication among communities. However, our shared history is also influenced by our own race, colour and creed. Although these are shared between people, they are also shared very differently. It is so important, as we walk together, that we understand that we all have different stories. I am sure some of my colleagues are hearing this story for the first time today. Phyllis's story is important, and is but one. I urge my colleagues to listen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300235"> I sat in some of the talking circles when the truth and reconciliation study was going on, and we heard heartbreaking stories. Last September 30 on Orange Shirt Day, I did a healing circle in my hometown, and some survivors were there. The generational effects of residential school still impact those families. Although the last school closed in 1981 or 1984, that generational negative impact is still going on to this day. It is seen in lateral violence. It is seen in substance abuse. It is seen in the abject poverty these communities live in.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300236">I hope my colleagues listening in or who are in the House today are taking pause. We should be looking at some things in the legislation and hopefully making amendments to strengthen it and make it better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300237">When talk about education, school district 27 in my riding was chosen by the first nations education steering committee to pilot curriculum changes for all grade five and 10 students, reflecting on the residential school experience. The events were designed to commemorate the residential school experience, to witness and honour the healing journey of survivors and their families and to commit to the ongoing process of reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300238"> Phyllis (Jack) Webstad told her story about the first day at the residential school when the shiny new shirt her grandmother bought her was taken from her. She was six years old.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300239">The <Affiliation DbId="253406" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> mentioned September 30 and why it was chosen. For kids right across our country and for parents too, for the most part, that back to school day is a sense of excitement. It is excitement for the parents because they are able to send their kids to school and are free for a few hours every day. They are excited to see their children go off on a journey of learning. However, that time of celebration for many is still one of reflection for others. It is very traumatic, and I have witnessed it first-hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300240">While we say every child matters, we need to remember that all children matter even if they are now adults. We have so many people who are still locked in that time when they were in that program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300241">A first nations leader called me last night. I had reached out to let him know I was speaking on this. He asked much of what my colleague from Sturgeon River asked. Will this do anything to solve the boil water advisories, the systemic racism or the suicide epidemics? No, it will not, but it is a step in the right direction to further educate about this. Education is such a critical component and it needs to be included in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300242"> We cannot just make a holiday for the sake of giving people another long weekend to load up their campers and go away. At the very end, we will be doing a disservice to the original intent of the bill. It is important we build that into the bill to ensure we never forget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300243">Whether it is September 30, as proposed, or some other day, we must remember the over 150,000 residential school children, the first nations, Inuit and Métis who went through that. We must honour the survivors and never forget the children who never made it home.</ParaText>

We have not sat down and learned our lessons. As I said in my comments, that educational component is vital and it is lacking in the current act. We need to ensure that education is critically important.</ParaText>

That bomber was lost in 1943 returning from a raid over Germany. On board was a crew of seven, including two Canadians: Sergeant John Francis James McCaw, 20, the youngest crew member, from Belleville, Ontario; and Flying Officer Harry Gregory Farrington, 24, from Niagara Falls, Ontario. </ParaText>

We called on Canada's private sector to help out. We signed agreements with four manufacturers who dropped everything to help Canada meet our supply needs. That is what we did and that is what Canada will continue to do. We will continue to protect Canadians, and Canadian ingenuity will help us achieve that.</ParaText>

To this day, it impedes migration of fishes, including the at-risk inner Bay of Fundy wild Atlantic salmon and American eel. The gates have been occasionally opened over the past 50-plus years to control water levels for Lake Pesquid and, more recently, to facilitate improved fish passage during periods of high water levels. The first salmon in 50 years were caught last summer beyond the causeway. The gates have never been opened to facilitate the annual runs of wild Atlantic salmon during the summer, which are really important. The petitioners want DFO to change this.</ParaText>

It is a hot spot for the environment, and this last woodlot on the Detroit River is important and precious for a national urban park.</ParaText>

I want to give thanks to indigenous Canadians for giving us the opportunity in this imperfect Parliament and this imperfect country to work toward reconciliation. I also want to give thanks to my colleagues, because this debate has been very non-partisan and I think there is a willingness to move forward. I want to particularly give thanks to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252893" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>. I do not know if people watching now saw him give his speech, but he had a whole pile of notes and he hardly looked at them. He gave us a speech that came from the heart, and I think everyone who heard what he had to say is going to be affected by it.</ParaText>

Sadly, many Canadians are in that situation, and they do not understand the whole situation with regard to indigenous Canadians.

It chokes me up when I speak of it. My staff had to compile a number of documents for me, but I did not refer to them because I have spent a considerable amount of time, not just during my political career but throughout my lifetime, seeing this. My friends and family are from the area that went through this program, and they live today with the scars.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300543">Just imagine being five or six years old and getting a present from your grandmother, and think about what a special gift that would be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300544">As soon as she got to the residential school, officials there stripped off her clothes and took away her orange shirt, and she never saw it again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300545">That should be enough to spur us to action to try to repair the damage caused, as is our ultimate duty. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of stories like that of young Phyllis. Thousands of children like Phyllis had everything taken away from them—the light that was inside them, the peace and love they had once enjoyed, the great and noble values of their nation that already defined who they were, the comfort provided by their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300546">That is what hurts the most: when everything that comforts us and defines us is lost. These victims and their families endured immense, terrible grief. This huge void will remain if we do not find a way to help heal the memories of first nations peoples, </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300547">Often the best way to fill such a void is to draw on the teachings of our elders. From my grandfather, I have kept the memory of an expression that has always stayed with me and, believe it or not, is directly related to Bill <Document DbId="10870098" Type="3">C-5</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300548">On this particular Friday, where there seems to be unanimity, I will share the origin of this expression. My grandfather Bouchard had his rituals. A 90-year old proud retired seaman and farmer, he spent his afternoons sitting on his rocking chair on the porch of his home on Chemin des Coudriers. Every day after his midday prayers he would be joined by his old friend and best audience who was nicknamed, and I am not joking, “Canada”. Grand-papa would tell legendary stories of treacherous winter crossings in an ice canoe, his anecdotes about horses chomping at the bit and his tall tales of the water's edge. He had an endless supply of these stories to the great delight of tourists who would greet him with, “Hello. Your stories are great. We do not often hear stories told that way these days. Can we record you?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300549">So many people would gather around the porch that sometimes there would be a bottleneck in the street. One day a tall, tanned man, with very dark eyes and hair, stopped, listened for a long time and took a great interest in the way my grandfather spoke, in the accent typical of Île-aux-Coudres. The indigenous man approached him and said, “Memory is a treasure that allows us to build a future of peace. It is most important that you tend to it, sir.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300550">My grandfather repeated this phrase every day until he died. He was not ill and, as he liked to say, he died from living. His indigenous friend's phrase were his last words to us: “Memory is a treasure that allows us to build a future of peace.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300551">There is a good chance that the memory we are referencing today in the House and that bears the heavy burden of the past is the most valued tool that will help us take another step, and then another, and then others towards this reconciliation that is often mentioned but too infrequently made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300552">There were 3,200 children who died in residential schools and who were abused in every sense of the word. Their bodies, their hearts and their spirits were abused. What about the families and parents who had their children snatched from their arms? What about all the wounds of the past, but also those of today, that are very real, absurd and so sad?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300553">Our memories harbour a thousand and one reasons, and it is up to us to make the present better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300554">Bill C-5 is a small step, compared to everything that needs to be acknowledged, reconciled and repaired, but it is a meaningful one. We hope to see many more steps, but this is at least something. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300556">I want to address all of the parents here today. How much are our children's lives worth?

              <ParaText id="6300560">In order for us to know, to remember, and to care about what can be done to bring about deep and lasting change, we must designate this day dedicated to truth and reconciliation. The Bloc Québécois has repeatedly pledged to be an ally of first nations peoples. That is why we will vote for this bill in principle, because it is part of the process of reconciliation with indigenous peoples. It responds to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations because it will keep the memory of the tragedy experienced by residential school survivors alive and foster an ongoing public dialogue about our national history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300561">As part of its work, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada refined its definition of reconciliation, and that, in and of itself, is an important sign of progress and a willingness to act. These principles, which can guide us toward reconciliation, are based on and supported by four pillars. They are the right to know, the right to justice, the right to reparation, and the guarantee of non-recurrence, which is the ultimate goal of this process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300562">This day should be an impetus for us to carry out our individual duty on the other 364 days of the year by carefully assessing the importance of our own actions in fulfilling our obligation to wholeheartedly, honestly and diligently participate in the advancement and improvement of the quality of life of first nations and peace and harmony between our respective nations. That is what it means to take care of something, and caring heals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300580">If passed, the bill would add a new holiday, namely, national day for truth and reconciliation, which would be observed every year on September 30.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300581">The Bloc Québécois has repeatedly pledged to be an ally of first nations people. That is why we will vote for this bill in principle, because it is part of the process of reconciliation with indigenous peoples, responds to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations, and will keep the memory of the tragedy experienced by residential school survivors alive and foster an ongoing public dialogue about our national history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300582">There is no denying that residential schools are a real blot on Canada's history. Between 1874 and 1996, there were 130 residential schools in Canada attended by over 150,000 indigenous children. The living conditions in those schools were poor. One of the direct causes of the sickness and deaths that occurred was the grossly inadequate funding from the government, which meant the food was of low quality, quantity and variety. The children in most residential schools had to cope with loneliness, a lack of contact with parents and family, frustration with not being allowed to speak their mother tongue, poor quality teaching, hunger, institutionalization, overwork, strict rules, brutality, and the fact that there was no one they could trust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300583">When they arrived at the residential schools, the children were stripped of their personal belongings and traditional clothing. They had their hair cut off and their names changed, and they were assigned a number. They were given new clothing, white people's clothing, which differed depending on what age group they were in. The children were punished if they spoke their mother tongue. These schools left them scarred and deeply traumatized. Most residential school survivors tell stories of loneliness, strict discipline, and physical, sexual, pedophilic and psychological abuse. Being separated from their parents and families was just the first trauma they endured. The children had to deal with a new culture, a new language and a new disciplinary system imposed on them by white people. Taking these children out of their communities, uprooting them, stripping them of their culture and destabilizing communities that had been shunted onto reserves resulted in deep trauma and social upheaval.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300584">Every year, since September 30, 2013, we have been encouraged to wear orange in honour of the indigenous children who were sent to residential schools. Orange Shirt Day has become an opportunity to keep the discussion on all aspects of residential schools happening. The date was chosen because it is the time of year in which children were taken from their homes to residential schools, and because it is an opportunity to set the stage for anti-racist and anti-bullying policies for the coming school year. It is also an opportunity for first nations, local governments, schools and communities to come together in the spirit of reconciliation and hope for generations of children to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300585">Phyllis Webstad started Orange Shirt Day to teach Canadians about the residential school system and to honour the survivors and their families. This day was inspired by Phyllis's own experience. On her first day at a residential school in British Columbia in 1973, her new orange shirt, a gift from her grandmother, was confiscated. She never got it back. This story is a sad example of how the residential school system sought to assimilate and colonialize indigenous children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300586">From a more technical point of view, the bill we are debating today amends three acts to bring about a single change: establishing September 30 as the national day for truth and reconciliation and making it a statutory holiday. The three acts in question are the Bills of Exchange Act, the Interpretation Act and the Canada Labour Code.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300587"> Clause 1 of the bill clearly situates its purpose within the context of the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300588">Clause 2 of the bill amends subparagraph 42(a)(i) of the Bills of Exchange Act to add the new national day for truth and reconciliation to the list of statutory holidays covered by the act. In practical terms, what this means is that, if Bill <Document DbId="10870098" Type="3">C-5</Document> is passed, September 30 will no longer count in the calculation of deadlines shorter than three days as set out in the Bills of Exchange Act. Consequently, a bill of exchange or cheque payable by September 30 will be payable on the next business day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300589">Clause 3 of the bill amends the portion of the definition of “holiday” in paragraph (a) of subsection 35(1) of the Interpretation Act to include the new national day for truth and reconciliation. The act guides the courts in interpreting federal legislation. The new statutory holiday would therefore be enshrined in federal legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300590">Clause 4 of the bill amends section 166 of part III of the Canada Labour Code to include the proposed new day in the definition of “general holiday”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300591">Clause 5 of the bill amends subsection 193(2) of the Canada Labour Code to entitle employees to a holiday with pay on the working day immediately preceding or following the general holiday if the holiday falls on the weekend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300592">Clause 6 provides that the bill will come into force two months after it receives royal assent on the day with the same calendar number as the day on which it receives royal assent or the last day of that second month. For example, if the bill receives royal assent on December 30, 2020, it would come into force on February 28, 2021. It it receives royal assent on January 1, 2021 it would come into force on March 1, 2021. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300593">As you know, the riding of Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou, which I represent here in the House, has several families who survived residential schools. It is therefore important to me that this bill is passed out of respect for them and in the interest of remembrance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300594">In the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, two quotes caught my attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300595">The first is, “Survivors shared their memories with Canada and the world so that the truth could no longer be denied. Survivors also remembered so that other Canadians could learn from these hard lessons of the past. They want Canadians to know, to remember, to care, and to change.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300596">All those who attended residential school suffered terribly from being separated from their parents, their brothers and sisters and their culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300597">This is the second quotation: “The federal government's policy of assimilation sought to break the chain of memory that connected the hearts, minds, and spirits of Aboriginal children to their families, communities, and nations.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300598">Imagine for a moment being taken from your family, denied your culture, your nation and your language, having to wear different clothing than what you are used to, and living entirely differently. We would be damaged for the rest of our lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300599">In closing, commemoration requires more than just the declaration of a special day as proposed in Bill <Document DbId="10870098" Type="3">C-5</Document>. It needs to happen through ceremonies and activities that will spark dialogue on the history of Indian residential schools. However, these measures must not relieve society of its responsibility for past mistakes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300619">I want to take this opportunity to thank the MP who brought this bill forward initially, Georgina Jolibois. I am continuously inspired by her work and by her amazing representation of indigenous communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300620">We are here today for many reasons. This bill is really about the reality that on September 30 we celebrate Orange Shirt Day, a national day to recognize truth and reconciliation. We want to take that day and make it into a statutory holiday, one where all members of Canada are committed to being a part of recognizing this part of our history: the stealing of children from their families; the many deaths of indigenous children during these terrible, long, dark times; and the trauma and torture they and their families experienced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300621">An elder from my riding named Alberta Billy once told me to imagine what would happen to myself and my community if every child from the age of four to 16 were suddenly removed. No one knew who they were with and who was caring for them. That always hits me hard. I cannot imagine any of us thinking about all our precious children, however we know them, being removed from our communities, and the silence and sadness that would hit all of us as we looked around and did not see their beautiful faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300622">This day should be a day where Canadians understand the incredible resilience of indigenous communities, because they are still here in the face of such adversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300623">Today, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize my husband, Darren Blaney, who is a survivor of residential school. When he was in residential school, his number was 97. When I think about a soul, a human being, identified by a number and losing so much more of their identity, I am absolutely heartbroken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300624">Many members in this House have spoken about the importance of education in this bill. I want to let people know that as of March 31, 2019, the government had only spent $4.5 million over its four years on education initiatives around indigenous history and residential school. This is simply not sufficient and not strategic, but is another piecemeal approach to this complex and dire situation the country needs to understand more fulsomely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300625">I want this day to be treated in the future with the sacred solemness it deserves. That means resources so all Canadians can take the moment and the time to remember these beautiful souls and the reality they and their communities are faced with. We want people to remember the story of Phyllis Jack, whose beautiful and sad story gives us Orange Shirt Day. She was six when she went to residential school. Her grandmother bought her a beautiful orange shirt to wear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300626">Who does not have a memory attached to those first days of school? It is a moment where, as kids, we felt proud, a piece of clothing that tells a child they are loved. As a parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle or loved one, we sometimes buy a special piece of clothing for the first day of school knowing that in that act, we are sending that child into something new and sometimes scary, with a little bit of love.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300627">In residential school, imagine how much more important this was. Not only were we buying a beautiful piece of clothing for a beloved child. We also knew that child would be leaving their family. They would leave and not understand how long it would be until they got to see their family again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300628">Imagine being a grandmother and feeling the utter hopelessness and fear of being forced to send a beloved grandchild to residential school, knowing all that grandmother can do is buy a shirt to somehow comfort that small body who will soon be longing for family and home. All too often in the history of Canada and today in Canada, indigenous people, communities and children are dehumanized.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300629">Today there are still just too many children being taken from their homes into care through apprehension. These numbers are even higher than the numbers of children taken from their families to be put in residential schools. This is something that we all must be accountable for as Canadians. We must all understand that we have an obligation. Every time the government does not fulfill the compliance orders that are asked of it, it shows again that the dehumanization of indigenous children is continuing and it is not okay. We must always speak against it, not just in platitudes but in action and in resources so that those communities can begin to rebuild in a more profound and sustainable way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300630">We know that there are still too many suicides in indigenous communities across Canada. One chief in my riding told me not too long ago, “I am working so hard to build up an economic base of strength for my community so that we can have a future that is positive and something hopeful for our young people, but when I have young people hanging themselves in our community, it is so hard to continue to push and to build. These are the everyday lived experiences of indigenous communities across this country. We cannot pretend that it is not directly linked to colonialism and to the residential school history that this country holds and still does not disclose in a more profound way so that we can all carry this burden, not just indigenous communities.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300631">We continue to work in our indigenous communities across Canada because of generations of residential school. That is important to recognize. This is generations of residential school, generations of communities that were suddenly empty of every child between the ages of four and 16. What does that do to a people and a community, and how do they rebuild after generations and generations? They only rebuild by resiliency, which indigenous communities have displayed again and again, but they also need the resources to be able to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300632">Parents are still learning how to parent. Traditions are still coming back to our communities and those communities need to be supported to allow parents the time to learn how to parent, build those capacities. A lot of communities across my riding have been asking for support. They want to see things get better in their communities. They see those beautiful pearls of resilience and growth and strength, but they need the resources to invest in them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300633">When I hear people say again and again, sadly, that it is over, that those days are over, the history is over and indigenous people need to get over it, I am both devastated and angry. It is not over. We are seeing that today in situations in indigenous communities across this country. We are seeing that today with the RCMP not responding appropriately when they should, because they do not know how to do it. We need to do better than that and Canada needs to do better than that. The impacts of residential schools and colonialism are not over; they are resounding through this country every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300634">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission report stated, “Reconciliation is not an Aboriginal problem; it is a Canadian one. Virtually all aspects of Canadian society may need to be reconsidered.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300635">The bill is a small step, but it is a step toward all of Canadian society reconsidering, reviewing and looking at things differently. One of the things that I know to be true is that impact and intent can totally be separated. When we look at systemic racism and we look at racism, some people know an intent that they may have, but they do not understand the impact. We must be responsible for our impact, not only our intent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300636">Today, as we go through the reality, we know that systemic racism continues to be a huge issue and all Canadians have to be responsible for addressing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300637">I want to talk about systemic racism because I have people tell me that they do not understand what systemic racism means. We are seeing it right now in the Mi'Kmaq community. The reality is no one should be surprised that this has been the outcome. The fact is that the federal government did not take leadership, did not create a plan and did not create space for this disconnect; it created a space for discontent and violence and for it to continue to grow.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300638">Reconciliation is a Canadian problem, and one that has a long history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300639">We need a government that will actually pay attention and create a plan so that we do not get to these places where people are incredibly unsafe, where the disruption in the community is profound and the wounds will take a long time to heal. It is unfair that the federal government does not take leadership and instead allows small indigenous communities to face these challenges with few or no resources to address them. That is systemic racism. Not having a plan is systemic racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300640">Systemic racism can also look like other things, and this brings me back to the intention and the impact. My son, when he was in grade 5, went to school one day. When he was in class, the teacher brought them to the library and sat the classroom down. The librarian showed a picture of a class of children at a residential school and asked them, “What do you see in this picture?” The indigenous children, all with their hair severely cut, looked very sad. They were all wearing uniforms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300641"> A lot of the children had things to say, like, “Maybe they didn't get their hot lunch” or “Maybe they were planning to go on a trip but they didn't get to, and that is why they are so sad.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300642">My son talked about sitting in that room, listening to a lot of non-indigenous young people give their ideas. He talked about his pain and frustration as he looked at that picture were because he knew immediately what that was. As he listened to the other children not knowing what it was, it made him realize how alone he was, how so few people understand the history of this country, and how much pressure he felt to have to educate and disclose the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300643">Finally, it burst out of him. He said, “Maybe it is because they are indigenous children in residential school and all they want is to go home to their parents.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300644">I do not think this teacher had any bad intention. I believe her complete intention was to educate and to show the kids in the class the history of Canada, but she did not think about the impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300645">This is so important. I have had a lot of young people talk to me and their parents about Orange Shirt Day, and how that day actually scares them. As indigenous children, as they learn this history, they become fearful that they may be taken from their families. The impact can often be unintended. That is why it is so important, when we address systemic racism, that we begin to ask questions, that we be curious about these issues, and that we stop putting the burden of educating on indigenous families, children and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300646">Years later, when my son moved up to middle school, he was actually able to work with his father on a piece of art for his school to recognize the history of indigenous residential school. This piece of art is still hanging in Southgate Middle School. It was a transformation mask that talked about the intention of residential school to take the Indian out of the child. On the front of it, there is a white face that opens up and shows an indigenous face. My son was very proud when they brought it to the school. It gave him the ability to talk about the history that was a reality for him every day in his life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300647">It is important, as this bill says, to dedicate a day to recognize the amazing power and resilience of the first people of this land. I want to make sure that this is really recognized as a part of this day. My granny went to Lejac Residential School in British Columbia for the majority of her childhood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300648">She was a fierce woman who I admired greatly and was slightly terrified of. I never once in my life saw her in a pair of pants. Even in the coldest parts of winter, she was always done up, wearing a dress, her hair and face made up, and often wearing a fabulous hairpiece, which she was known for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300649">She used to tell me, frequently, “No complaining, Rachel, we are still here. If you don't like it, work on fixing it.” It took me years to understand that she was teaching me the power of indigenous people across country, We are still here, and the guilt of non-indigenous people and what they feel is really not helpful.</ParaText>

In the continuous face of all these challenges, generation after generation, indigenous people are still here, still fighting and still finding a way to hold on to their traditions and their history. They are still here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300651">When I think of Orange Shirt Day, I think of my granny who survived tremendous challenges, and of my dad and my aunties and uncles who have worked so hard to reclaim our culture and our history and make sure that her grandchildren have had that connection.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300662">The reason indigenous children are in care today at such high rates is because we have had continuous Conservative and Liberal governments pass the buck and continue to use language like the <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> did in his question: to get indigenous communities to come together and create solutions. They are coming together. They are working hard every day because they do not want to see their children leaving their communities. What they require are the resources. Any time any government wants to stand up and be accountable for that I will be happy to work with it, but I still have not seen it.</ParaText>

All families have to be accountable, but we need resources there to support those families.</ParaText>

When I look at what is happening with the Mi'kmaq, I remember a chief saying to me not too long ago that if there is a court decision where the indigenous people do not win, it is implemented the next day, but if a court decision is made and the indigenous people do win, it takes 21 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300672">I look at this and think, how long do indigenous communities have to wait?

It means they can make a little bit, but not too much, because if they have too much what independence could they take that the government could not fight back? That is a continuous concern.

              <ParaText id="6300689">Today, we are discussing an important step forward on the path of reconciliation and healing for first nations, Inuit and Métis people. It is a step forward in publicly honouring survivors, their families and communities by implementing calls to action 80 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to establish a statutory holiday, a national day for truth and reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300690">Before my time as an MP, I was a professor at Cape Breton University. I taught Mi'kmaq history and about the Indian residential schools. I was also the treaty education lead for Nova Scotia, which meant that I would do presentations for schools, businesses, industry and all those who asked about the truth and reconciliation and the Indian residential schools. People would ask me why they were never taught this before, why they were just learning this for this first time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300691">The Indian residential schools operated in my home province of Nova Scotia between 1929 and 1967 in Shubenacadie. In my home province, for more than 40 years, children were forcefully removed from their homes. They were forcefully removed from all they ever knew, taken from loving Mi'kmaq families. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300693">The first comes from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The odds of dying for a soldier in World War II was one in 26. The odds of dying for children in the Indian residential schools was one in 25. Let that sink in. These were not soldiers with guns and helmets. These were children wearing their Sunday-best clothes, Sunday dresses, and they never came home. That is why we call them survivors, like my Aunt Eleanor Mitchell, my Uncle Fudd Lewis and the brave author from Sipekne'katik, Isabelle Knockwood. When I was a young student at that same university, I read her book and realized the horrible legacy of the residential schools and the horrible treatment of these children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300694">When we talk of truth and reconciliation, we speak of the children. However, I want members to think about their children at home.

Reconciliation not only requires apologies, reparations, the relearning of Canada’s national history, and public commemoration, but also needs real social, political, and economic change. Ongoing public education and dialogue are essential to reconciliation. Governments, churches, educational institutions, and Canadians from all walks of life are responsible for taking action on reconciliation in concrete ways, working collaboratively with Aboriginal peoples. Reconciliation begins with each and every one of us.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6300702">This national day would honour the survivors of the painful legacy of residential schools, along with their families and communities. It would be a reminder to everyone in Canada to never forget the pain and trauma that residential schools caused and continue to cause, passed on as intergenerational trauma. It would create an opportunity for indigenous survivors of residential schools and their loved ones to tell their stories, and it would be an opportunity for the rest of us to learn carefully.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300703">I firmly believe that the proposed national day of truth and reconciliation will be a way for us to amplify and strengthen the voices of first nations, Inuit and Métis people. It will be a way to ensure that the stories and experiences, the pain, the trauma and the history of first nations, Inuit and Métis people are never forgotten. It will be a way to keep these histories alive in our hearts and in our minds, so that they may inform our actions going forward. With this, we may build a brighter future based on a renewed nation-to-nation, government-to-government and Inuit-to-Crown relationship based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300704">It is important to emphasize that this day should be utilized like Remembrance Day, as an opportunity to educate all Canadian children across Canada on this vital and tragic part of our history, should this legislation become law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300705">I would like to quote Senator Murray Sinclair, who stated, “While Indigenous children were being mistreated in residential schools by being told they were heathens, savages and pagans and inferior people—that same message was being delivered in the public schools of this country.” We need to change that. We need to see real funding and material support allocated to heritage, so that we can provide educational materials and tangible supports to school boards across Canada in telling these stories and this part of our shared history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300706">This is of fundamental importance to schools across the country. I remember, in December of 2015, when they talked about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was launched. I remember our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> telling a story of when he went to school. When it was time to discuss indigenous history, it was skipped over by the teacher saying, it was not very interesting. That day, our Prime Minister made a vow that never again will indigenous history be skipped over and never again will indigenous Canadians be told that their history is not integral to Canadian history. With the passage of the bill, we help ensure that people will never ask why they were never taught this in our schools.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300707"> I always used to talk in my treaty education presentations about the rice experiment by Dr. Emoto. There were two jars of water and rice. One jar was fed nothing but positive energy, saying, “You're great. You're good. You're good rice,” whatever they tell water and rice in an experiment. The other jar of water and rice was fed nothing but negativity, saying “You're worthless. You'll never amount to anything.” After seven weeks of this experiment, they noticed that the water and rice that was fed negativity began to mould and go bad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300708"> If this is what seven weeks can do to water and rice, imagine what seven generations can do to an entire people when they are told they are worthless and inferior. This is what indigenous people in the country have had to deal with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300709">The failures of one generation can be the opportunities of the next. With this bill, with education, with awareness, this is where we could be in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300730">I think we can all agree on the importance of acknowledging the history and legacy of residential schools and their tragic impact on first nations, Inuit and Métis peoples.

              <ParaText id="6300731">The last residential school closed its doors in 1996, just 24 years ago. This is not ancient history. The number of survivors is great, the victims and their families greater. The healing process will take time, and this bill is a step toward righting the wrongs inflicted throughout our colonial past. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300732">September is a painful time for many indigenous peoples. It was the month that their children were taken back to school year after year and forced to leave their loved ones and communities behind. It is appropriate to mark this pain experienced by generations of indigenous children, parents, families and communities, a pain that continues to be passed on today in the form of intergenerational trauma, with a solemn day of reflection, remembrance and action toward reconciliation. It is a day to honour residential school survivors and their families and to learn about their stories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300733">On September 29, the <Affiliation DbId="253406" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> announced a response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's call to action number 80, which seeks to establish, as a federal statutory holiday, a national day for truth and reconciliation. This day will honour survivors, their families and their communities while ensuring that public commemoration of the history and legacy of residential schools remains a vital component of the reconciliation process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300734">This bill seeks to establish a national day for truth and reconciliation that will be observed on September 30. As members may know, this is a particularly significantly date for indigenous peoples. It is the date of a grassroots movement called Orange Shirt Day, started by Phyllis Webstad, named for the orange shirt that she and her grandmother chose for her first day of residential school, only to have it stolen away when she arrived. Her orange shirt has become a symbol for the cultures, languages and childhoods that were ripped away from the more than 150,000 students of residential schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300735">Every year on Orange Shirt Day, we encourage Canadians to take time to listen to the stories of survivors, learn about residential schools and come together to give hope to every child of current and future generations. This day would further spread these stories of pain and hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300736">This year, on September 30, I walked by a school in my riding during lunch hour and on the playground I saw a sea of orange. Students had all come to school wearing orange shirts and, more importantly, were learning the legacy of residential schools. This is something that did not happen when I was their age or even when my son was in school. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300737">The work of preserving these stories and educating Canadians about the horrors perpetrated at residential schools is extremely difficult and painful. That is why I would like to praise the work done by the amazing people at the Woodland Cultural Centre in Brantford, Ontario. Opened in 1972, the centre aims to preserve, present, create and educate people on the history, art, language and culture of the Haudenosaunee people of the Eastern Woodlands. It was established at the site of the Mohawk Institute residential school, the oldest residential school in Canada, which was operated from 1829 through 1970. It was nicknamed the Mush Hole by its students, as the children were fed only oatmeal three times a day, every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300738">With its museum, art galleries, library and language centre, I encourage anyone able to visit the Woodland Cultural Centre for a unique and sobering learning experience to do so. It will be offering a virtual public tour on November 18 at 7 p.m. More information can be found at woodlandculturalcentre.ca.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300739">Earlier this year, I attended a performance of <I>The Mush Hole</I> at The Burlington Performing Arts Centre. Telling the terrible story of what happened at the Mohawk Institute through dance and theatre, <I>The Mush Hole</I> is based on interviews and writings by residential school survivors. It explores not only what happened at the Mush Hole, but the intergenerational trauma experienced by the survivors and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300740">To further preserve and spread the history of residential schools, the Portage la Prairie residential school in Manitoba and the Shubenacadie residential school in Nova Scotia are being declared national historic sites this year. It is my hope that the Woodland Cultural Centre will also be declared a national historic site.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300741">The residential school system is a national tragedy, a stain of colonialism upheld by systemic racism. Acknowledging its past and educating Canadians about the experience of indigenous children in these schools will ensure that this history is never forgotten and never repeated. It is a step toward righting past wrongs.</ParaText>

Once this bill has passed, the residential school system would be designated as an event of national historic significance, helping Canadians understand our history and its consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300743">While the government has taken important steps toward reconciliation, much more needs to be done. Canadians' understanding of the painful legacy of residential schools is vital to truth-telling, reconciliation and the recognition of past injustices. It will inform our future actions with the full knowledge of what has been done to indigenous people across this land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300744">A few years ago, in my riding, I held a screening of the documentary <I>We Were Children</I>. It tells the story of two children who were taken from their homes and placed in residential schools where they suffered years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Afterward, an 80-year-old former MP said he learned more in that night than he had in his entire life. New Canadians in attendance asked why they had never learned about this when they came to Canada. This all speaks to the importance of educating Canadians about our colonial past and the impact on generations of indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300745">In 2012, I had the opportunity to visit Pelican Falls First Nations High School in Sioux Lookout, a former residential school that is now run by the Northern Nishnawbe Education Council. While there, I had the honour to meet executive director Norma Kejick, an incredible woman whose good work was highlighted in the book <I>Seven Fallen Feathers</I>. Norma gave us a tour which included the surrounding forest, where many students died while trying to find their way home when it was a residential school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300746">When I left the school, I broke down in tears. How could a country treat innocent children in such a horrific way? How could we strip them from their families, the love of their parents and their broader community? How could we try to erase their culture and language? It is unimaginable to me that we could treat other humans this way, and yet we did it in the not so distant past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300747">A national day for truth and reconciliation would give us the opportunity to listen to all indigenous voices, reflect on past wrongs, learn from our mistakes and take action to advance meaningful reconciliation. On Orange Shirt Day, every child matters, and ever indigenous child deserves to be cared for, feel the full sense of their worth and feel hopeful for their future. Every single person in Canada shares the burden and shame of our reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300748">As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous Services, I know how important reconciliation is to our government, but I also know there is much more work to be done. Designating September 30 as the national day for truth and reconciliation would represent a national acknowledgement of our country's history and a way to honour survivors of residential schools.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300760">Mr. Speaker, in 2000, I had the wonderful privilege of conducting a three-year review of our indigenous communities in the Northwest Territories and their access to natural resources. One of the things that became obvious to everyone very quickly was the extent the lingering effects of residential schools on our indigenous population were hindering its ability to fully participate in economic opportunities. For example, there was a major debate, which still rages, between impact benefit agreements and equity participation in major resource projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300761">I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could share some of her insight on the extent to which we have progress to make, the distance yet to go, in making sure our indigenous communities are full participants in these resource projects and their development.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300763">The member hit on a very important point, which is that we need to ensure that indigenous peoples can fully participate in the economy. Certainly, that has not been possible in the past for many reasons, some of which are directly because of the Government of Canada. However, there are a number of things that our government is doing, one of which is that the <Affiliation DbId="253382" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> is striving to reach a goal of 5% procurement from indigenous business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300764">I know from my conversations with Tabatha Bull from the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, that many indigenous-owned businesses are in fact in the resource sector, so we must ensure that they are able to fully participate in the economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300765">Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting day listening to speeches. I worked last night on this intervention. It is challenging, in the sense of my background and culture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300766">It takes me back to the heritage committee when we dealt with this topic, and my understanding and knowledge were lacking. We depended on the witnesses to inform, explain and educate us. Were they all on the same page? No, there were differences of opinion about which day, indigenous day, orange shirt day. We heard opinions about more important things that should be done. It was interesting to listen as they brought it to us at that committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300767">By the way, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252667" Type="2">Fredericton</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300768">The bill has now been returned to the House. The goal of this legislation is extremely important, with the reconciliation with indigenous people as the national objective. The residential school is a dark chapter in Canadian history. I did not live it. My family did not live it, but I have visited Siksika Nation, which is in my riding. It is the second largest nation in the country. On that nation there were two residential schools run by two different Christian faiths. One school is gone. The other school is still there. I visited those places with elders. Where the school is gone, there is what they believe to be an unmarked graveyard with no recognition but memories of who went there and never came home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300769">The other one that is still standing is now called Old Sun Community College. The building has been refitted, changed and provides programs that suit the times that are needed now. As I walked through that building with an elder, there were parts of that building she would go through and parts she would not. She remembered some horrific things in that building, like the day her sister fell three storeys and landed at her feet and it killed her. That should not have happened, but it did. I cannot remember that because it is not part of my background, but I could listen to an elder tell me that story. The story of when she was six years old and would go to school and escape and go home. Her parents would be horrified that she was there, because they knew the Indian agent would soon arrive at the door threatening to take away anything that they had unless she was returned to school. That is not part of my memory, but it is part of my learning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300770">The bill is important and we are putting the onus on 5% of the population to teach us. Is that the way to do it? We have adults in this country who do not have this education or the opportunity. The town of Strathmore has done phenomenal work with the Siksika Nation. Many students from both communities, Siksika and Strathmore, go to that school. The drama teacher in that school wrote a phenomenal play called New Blood. It is put on by high school students from Strathmore and Siksika. It needs to be seen far and wide because it would educate adults.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300771"> I have visited our National Arts Centre, which now has two indigenous employees, but it has no money. I want the play to come to Ottawa. We need adults educated. As mentioned many times in the House, education is a critical piece. However, it is not just for students, it is for adults as well. I have watched that play and seen what the adults learned from it. It is put on by indigenous and non-indigenous students working together to produce a fantastic story of reconciliation with history in it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300772">Today, as I look at the notes I had and listen to the members, I look at the structure of, for example, Siksika. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300773">Members can look at what the federal governments, provincial governments and municipal governments are responsible for, but do they understand what a municipal government, supposedly, at the band level does? Siksika Nation's council takes care of the roads and the sewer and the water, when it works, if it works, if it is there, but they are also responsible for education in their nation and they are responsible for health. There is a whole broad range of things they are responsible for, and we, as an adult country, do not understand the challenges that level of government has and the responsibilities it has. We do not know that unless we take the time to learn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300774">How are we going to learn it? Are we putting the onus of this bill on 5% of the population, without resources, to teach the rest of us? That is not going to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300775">We have a piece of legislation that should be approved. I totally agree that it should be approved. However, where is the backup, in the sense of what the responsibility is to get the education for this to the population? I am not talking about schoolchildren; I am talking about the adult population. Where is it? We are now putting a heavy debt back on the indigenous people to educate the rest of us by saying, “You've got a day”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300776"> I totally agree with the day. On Siksika reserve, one of the councillors led a walk from those unmarked graves at the school, which is gone, across the nation to the other school. That is an education those people understand. They are walking those footpaths. They are walking the footpaths that their elders walked when they went back and forth. We were not there. We do not know that path. We have to learn it, or this just becomes another holiday, which is wrong. We cannot let this slip into another holiday, yet we are putting the onus on the indigenous people to do it. We are naming it. I am a person who is not of that culture. It is not my history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300777">I remember when we passed the indigenous languages bill, Bill <Document DbId="10293463" Type="3">C-91</Document>, at the heritage committee. We had many witnesses come, and the ones I liked the best were the ones who said, “How is the money going to get to our school kids so we can keep our heritage and our culture with our language?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300778"> I made amendments at that committee, and they did not pass. I wanted the money to go directly to the school level, just like the federal government does with the gas tax, which goes directly to the municipality. We bypass the other people and it gets done. I wanted the money to go to the indigenous communities and their schools. That is not where it went. It went to the three major organizations in this country. The leadership of Siksika Nation asked me about this legislation and the money. I said to ask the government and to ask their indigenous organizations where it is. Where is it? They are not preserving their language; they are not getting the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300779">We have to work at the grassroots level, just like the indigenous people understand they need to do with their language. They need to get into their schools and teach their own children their languages to keep their cultures. It is an oral culture. They have passed many things on orally. It is a story culture, from elders to generation to generation, but they are not getting the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300780"> My fear is that we will pass this and we will have a day of recognition. They will be proud to have it, but will the 95% of the rest of Canadians have a clue? That is my fear.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300784">However, I will tell members a problem that we have, The heritage committee has a study and now we have brought it back. Siksika nation has a world-class place for artifacts called Blackfoot Crossing. The people were trying to get the original clothing of Chief Crowfoot, who signed the original agreement in 1877. It was in a museum in London. They can not get it back because we have legislation that says it has to be a museum that requests it. We have an archaic word in there that does not allow some indigenous people to bring back artifacts to places on their nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300785">We need to fix it. Again, I will have it on the heritage committee for a study. We need to change that so these people can have their artifacts, and we do not have to use that archaic word. They have beautiful facilities, but we have to fix that.</ParaText>

We cannot just say these words. We must have intention and action behind them, and I implore each member of the House to do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300796">It is an honour to have the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10870098" Type="3">C-5</Document>, and I wish to thank my Conservative colleague for sharing his time with me today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300797">The issue of meaningful reconciliation is an issue that is important to my constituents and to people across this country, and it is particularly close to my heart for many, many reasons. The first is as a mom of indigenous children. My boys are Wolastoqiyik. They are being raised with an appreciation for their identity, language and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300798">My oldest son is in grade 3 in a public school that has made incredible efforts to not only include indigenous knowledge, history and culture but to truly celebrate it. It is front and centre at every school assembly and event, and in daily routines. There are integrated educational opportunities for all children, and there are unique learning opportunities for indigenous youth through permanent staff employed by our local first nation community, who work at the school every day in innovative and exciting ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300799">My youngest son is three years old and attends an on-reserve head start program at the Welamukotuk Early Learning Centre. He receives instruction from his family members and some of our close friends. He is surrounded with love and care and dedication to culturally responsive education. Incidentally, his first day of school was on Orange Shirt Day last year. I could not help but think of the beauty of coming full circle like that, and the symbolic significance that his education will begin and proceed so differently than so many of his ancestors'.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300800">My oldest child looks more like me, with Celtic roots and light skin, although he is proud to be indigenous. My youngest looks more like my husband, with dark skin and dark eyes. My prayer for him is always that he will not grow to experience racism and discrimination because of who he is. I pray he will not feel like he does not belong or that he is not represented in the curriculum he learns throughout his educational journey, as my husband has felt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300801">Another reason Bill <Document DbId="10870098" Type="3">C-5</Document> is so important to me is due to my passion for teaching. My work in the public school system in New Brunswick was on behalf of first nation communities. I worked to include accurate history and improve access to language and cultural experiences for indigenous students, as well as to advocate for institutional reforms for enhanced social justice equity in our provincial education system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300802">I have seen the many ways our system continues to fail indigenous students. I have also seen the incredible resilience of indigenous students, and I have had the honour to witness inspiring growth, activism and leadership. This generation of youth is ready to tackle our biggest challenges and to lead Canada into a brighter future as the fastest-growing demographic. The seven generations concept comes to mind and reinforces the idea that we bring with us the lessons and experiences of our ancestors and that both trauma and healing pass through the bloodline to the present day, that the decisions we make today should result in a sustainable and equitable world seven generations into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300803">This brings me to our responsibility as Canadians. Orange Shirt Day, in an educational context, is an opportunity to learn, honour and acknowledge the calls to action, and to create space for indigenous elders and survivors to share their truth and feel our love and appreciation. Schools, businesses and organizations across New Brunswick proudly wear orange and undertake events and activities. This takes the form of healing walks, school assemblies, language lessons, mini powwows and other creative and formative expressions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300804">I worry Bill <Document DbId="10870098" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which would make this day a holiday, could have the consequence of losing some of the momentum that has been built around awareness, particularly in our schools. I also worry that the concession of this day being only for federal employees may have the consequence of losing the power of the intent of a national holiday. I will certainly do all I can to prevent this in my community, and I would like to see some extra assurances with dedicated investments around this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300805">I am also not convinced the bill represents a meaningful act of reconciliation with indigenous peoples, especially considering events that are transpiring around the country. It seems to me the government makes a habit of selecting only the easiest calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, abandoning those that require genuine effort, abdicating responsibility for the hard work we must undertake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300806">I remind the House there is a long list of education and health outcomes that should be our focus, those that would have lasting impacts for positive change, the sorts of changes that would mean indigenous women would not have to suffer as Joyce Echaquan did in her last moments of life and the sorts of changes that would mean Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi might still be with us today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300807">So far, most of the change I am seeing in Canada is a result of the efforts of indigenous communities and individuals. This is unacceptable. Canada has a responsibility to make things right. Canada must make amends. Canada must have these difficult conversations and must show leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300808"> Our success will be measured in the way we respond to indigenous nations on an ongoing basis when questions of sovereignty arise, as they have in Nova Scotia in recent weeks. It will be measured in the way we embrace the collective and inherent rights of indigenous peoples, the way we carry out our relationships with these nations, and the way we embolden or chastise racist commentary from Canadians who do not yet understand these rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300809">I recognize that a national memorial holiday was included in the TRC, and I have committed to stand behind each call to action; therefore, I will certainly vote in favour of the bill. However, I hope the government understands its continuing responsibility to support educational initiatives and to fund events and activities around this national holiday. The work we do today in the House will have repercussions on the next seven generations. It will be the foundation of a future in which we understand the truth of our past and celebrate what we have built together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300810"> I implore Canadians to observe this holiday, to learn the true intention behind it and to take on the challenge of becoming allies and champions of reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300811">I will end with a metaphor sent to me by Eddy Charlie, a member of the Cowichan Nation and a residential school survivor. He described the long-term intergenerational impacts of the trauma inflicted by residential schools as poison leeched into a river, contaminating everything along the way. He said, “We've been contaminated by hate, pain and aggression, and until we clean up that river, we'll always be stuck in a really bad place.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300812">The process of cleaning up that river is under way. It is our job as parliamentarians, and as Canadians, to roll up our sleeves and get to work. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300828">Mr. Speaker, I certainly think it is important to formally enshrine this as an official holiday in Canada. I just wonder what that means. I think we need to have more conversations about the responsibility of non-indigenous Canadians to reconcile what we have done. I think about how we celebrate National Indigenous Peoples Day. A lot of positive actions come out of such a day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300829">I ask that more Canadians learn. For me, it is really about the educational opportunity, so it goes back to investments, and it goes back to supports. If we were to do better in our education system, if we were to have a more culturally responsive curriculum as part of the provincial system in general, I think that would have a bigger impact than, perhaps, a national holiday.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6300839">I am joining the House from my riding of Scarborough—Rouge Park on the traditional territory of many nations, including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinabe, Chippewa, Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300840"> I am honoured to speak here today on the national day for truth and reconciliation. It is a day marked by September 30, traditionally Orange Shirt Day. I want to thank the many survivors and family members who have taught me so much about residential schools over the years. I am particularly honoured to work with colleagues, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252948" Type="2">Northwest Territories</Affiliation>, who himself is a survivor; former member of Parliament Romeo Saganash; and former member of Parliament Georgina Jolibois, who was the initial sponsor of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300841">I am also inspired by the work of so many of my colleagues here, including the member for <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> and my good friend the member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation>. I am also inspired by the words of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252667" Type="2">Fredericton</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="253014" Type="2">North Island—Powell River</Affiliation>, members representing many different parties within our House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300842">Let us be clear, this day is to respect, honour and reflect on the enormous number of lives lost in the generations of first nations, Inuit and Métis, and those whose lives have been forever changed. It is equally to recognize the enormous resilience of the survivors and their families. It is about education, as many have said, but it is not about indigenous people educating non-indigenous people about what has happened with residential schools and the many other oppressive things that have happened in this country since 1867. It is about Canadians learning and taking the initiative to understand what this day marks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300843">This is not about revictimizing those who have enormous pain, enormous struggles to overcome and intergenerational trauma that cannot be erased overnight. When I speak about reconciliation, I often qualify this term, because I know it is a term that is used quite regularly. It is used by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the 94 calls to action, and it is a term that our government uses quite regularly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300844">As someone who has worked on the issue of reconciliation, it is not one where those who are affected, those who are victimized need to reconcile. It is about those who perpetrated these atrocities who need to come forward, and make sure the conditions are there for reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300845">As long as we have a survivor, as long as we have a child of a survivor who is directly impacted by residential schools, it will be very difficult to reconcile. As long as those lives continue, in terms of every socio-economic measure, to not be at par with non-indigenous people, the conditions will not be there for reconciliation to take shape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300846">As much as we mark this day, as much as this day is important and significant, it is a day for Canadians to recommit and double down on the need for reconciliation to take place, the need for all the social determinants of health to be rectified and to ensure that we have a proper plan and path forward to ensure that true equality can take shape in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300847">A number of questions were posed about the Indian Act itself. I can categorically say that it is a deeply flawed and deeply racist act that continues to subjugate first nations people from coast to coast to coast in a very colonial setting. I do not know how else to say it, but it is a deeply racist piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300848">Sadly, it is one of those pieces of legislation that cannot just be undone; it took generations to put together.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="25">(1425)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300849">In many ways, to be able to address some of the issues within first nations communities, it is important that we are working toward nation-to-nation relationships. This would allow first nations communities, nations and peoples to actually negotiate and establish their own governance and self-determination over both very basic and very complex things, including land, resources, language, justice and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300850">Until we do that, it would be too simplistic of a solution to say we are going to eliminate the Indian Act altogether. It is one of those acts, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="253036" Type="2">Sydney—Victoria</Affiliation> said quite well, that is unfortunately not ready to be taken down yet, but that is where we need to end up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300851">Let me speak more on this day itself as the parliamentary secretary who was working on this file. We heard from so many different people on the need for this day. There was a lot of discussion. The TRC call to action number 80 did not specify September 30, but it definitely called for a day that would mark this important recognition of residential schools. In fact, September 30 became the natural fit, and that was the consensus we received from many individuals, survivors, leaders, communities and indigenous people from all walks of life. That consensus allowed us to move forward with this date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300852">It is also something that will not mark the end. In fact, it will be the beginning. Someone mentioned that we could establish this day and then go away. No, this is in fact the beginning of a longer journey, a longer discussion and a more elaborate conversation as to how this should be marked in each and every community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300853">In Scarborough—Rouge Park, in places like the GTA, there are very few resources available. Even though we have very large populations of urban indigenous people, we have very few resources for education. This is where our school boards and provinces need to come in. It would be similar to Remembrance Day, when there are actual events in schools. In Ontario, at least, it is not a provincial holiday. This should be a day where people are able to mark it locally and speak about it. Young people will be able to understand and learn from each other and from their teachers on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300854">I began going to school in Canada in grade four, and I can tell members I did not learn about this until well into my university years. Even then, I would say it was insufficient. That learning and education needs to take place on a day like this. It would not be a holiday in many provinces, until they bring legislation, but it would allow schools to mark the day and be able to observe it in a very poignant manner. This statutory holiday will ensure that public commemoration of the tragic and painful history and legacy of residential schools remains a vital component of the reconciliation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300855">Throughout the witness testimony for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, commissioners heard from many organizations and groups that highlighted the importance and value of a day to commemorate. They talked about the need to have a date to reflect on the harm that has been historically inflicted upon first nations, Inuit and Métis people. I hope this House is able to adopt this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="30">(1430)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6300856">I want to note that there are many calls to action, and almost 80% of the calls to action under the sole responsibility of the federal government and shared responsibility of the provinces have been completed or are well under way. This is one of them. I also want to note that call to action number 50, which calls on the Pope to apologize on behalf of the actions of the Catholic Church, may gain traction given the developments from the Pope this week on same-sex marriage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6300857">I am hoping that we will be able to work together as faith groups, as governments and as indigenous people to advance reconciliation in Canada. I hope to see this legislation pass as soon as possible.</ParaText>
