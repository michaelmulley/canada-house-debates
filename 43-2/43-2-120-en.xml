              <ParaText id="6810087">Mr. Speaker, Canada is one the most tolerant and welcoming countries on earth. Canada is rightfully known as a place that accepts and affirms the equal rights, freedoms, opportunities, security, dignity and sanctity of all people of all ethnicities, faiths, sexual orientations, backgrounds and personal identities. These are the values and aspirations of the vast majority of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810088">Canada is not perfect. Racism and racists exist in Canada. Heinous crimes of murder and violent attacks involving race and religious-based hate have been carried out in Canada. Action must be taken to protect innocent, vulnerable Canadians and to enact consequences when racism has made it out in discrimination, violence, incitement of harm or criminal activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810089">Racism exists in recent and long-standing systemic legacies like residential schools and forced relocations. Racism can be found in institutional structures that fail to root out racist elements within their ranks. It would be wrong to describe the RCMP or all its individual officers and staff as inherently racist or holding racist beliefs, or to blame all societal challenges on one institution. It is also true that various failures to respond effectively to the needs and realities of indigenous and racialized communities have led to a lack of trust and can be tied to biased outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810090">These challenges must be met with practical policy changes that solve institutional problems. It is crucial that individuals face consequences for their actions. Defunding or arbitrarily dismantling institutions is not a solution, but is evidence of allowing frustration to triumph over real reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810091">Conservatives of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security believe that some of the recommendations of the main report fall short of compelling meaningful action, go beyond the scope of the study or serve ideological objectives that we cannot endorse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810092">For those reasons, we are tabling a supplementary report that focuses on practical solutions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810097">Mr. Speaker, Canadians are coming to a greater understanding of the role that the RCMP and policing in general have and continue to play in perpetuating systemic racism against indigenous and Black communities. It has become unmistakably clear that the RCMP needs transformational change. It needs to evolve from a paramilitary national police force with a colonial legacy into a modern, bias-free national police service with civilian oversight and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810098">New Democrats fully support the recommendations laid out in the public safety committee's report on systemic racism in Canadian policing, but make the following additional recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810099">First, the depot in Regina should be closed. For generations, it has indoctrinated new recruits into the paramilitary culture and structure. It needs to be replaced with a national police college built from the ground up that provides professional education and training in de-escalation, implicit bias, gender-based violence, cultural awareness and the history of colonialism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810100">Second, the government should consult with indigenous communities on whether they want a separate indigenous police college to provide training for indigenous police services rooted in cultural knowledge and history. The federal government should provide any required funding and resources for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810101">Third, the government should introduce measures to immediately and automatically expunge all criminal records of convictions and findings of guilt for the simple possession of small amounts of cannabis, which we know disproportionately burdens Black, indigenous and other racialized Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810102">Fourth, we should empower mental health professionals to be the first responders whenever possible, since for many the police embody the systemic racism that has permeated our system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810103">While we fully support the recommendations in this report, the transformation that is needed will simply not be possible unless the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> take full responsibility for making that change happen with a whole-of-government approach.</ParaText>

It is important to us that significant action be taken so that everyone can live in a society where they feel safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810109">We believe that Canada’s treatment of first nations and the Inuit is the epitome of a racist system that discriminates against first nations. Despite the progress society has made over time to address discrimination and racism, a number of recent tragedies remind us that we still have a long way to go before all people can live in a society free from discrimination based on race, gender, language or ethnicity. This report by the Standing Committee on Public Safety is one small step toward that goal. </ParaText>

Post-secondary educational excellence and accessibility are the single most important driver of a growing economy and a better Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810119">Access to and the quality of our post-secondary institutions are being eroded due to the ever-increasing cost of tuition, the increased commercialization of everything from food services to research, and cutbacks to programs and other care services. Currently, federal support for post-secondary education is rolled into the Canada social transfer. This bill separates post-secondary education funding to provinces from other social transfer funding, creates a framework for post-secondary education funding, and ties that funding to meeting quality and accessibility standards, including limiting short-term, casual and contract academic labour and ensuring reasonable access for qualified persons regardless of their ability to pay.</ParaText>

In 2010, Lyle and Marie McCann of St. Albert, Alberta, left their home on a trip to British Columbia. Shortly after their departure, they were murdered, although their remains have never been found. With a body of overwhelming evidence, their killer was found and convicted of manslaughter. He is eligible for parole this year, despite never having admitted to his crime, nor providing the family of the victims the closure of knowing the whereabouts of their loved ones. The fact that a killer can walk free on our streets while a family is denied the closure of a funeral is an injustice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810139"> Bret McCann, the son of Lyle and Marie McCann had this to say: “By withholding where he left their bodies, [my parents' killer] is able to continuously revictimize our family. And without a proper funeral and memorial, our family is unable to fully grieve and reach a measure of closure.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810140">This legislation would correct that injustice by introducing new consequences at sentencing and parole hearings for refusing to provide material evidence on the location of victims' remains. This will give the authorities the tools and discretion to introduce justice for families of victims. It is time to put the rights of victims and their families, not criminals, first. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810167"> Mr. Speaker, I hope this is the final time I will have to address the House virtually. I look forward to being in Ottawa next week and hope very much that we will be back to normal sessions come the fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810168">I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252617" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810169">I just have to say that this is a rare measure that we are requesting of all members of the House of Commons to censure the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. The last time anyone was censured in the House was back in 2002, and it has come to this point, because the Minister of National Defence has refused to do the honourable thing and resign, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has refused to do the right thing and fire the Minister of National Defence. Essentially, that leaves it up to us in the House of Commons to censure the minister going forward, until the voters of Vancouver South have an opportunity to express their displeasure in the upcoming federal election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810170">I also just want to say to the Speaker, who has stepped into the chair, knowing that he has announced that he will not be running in the next federal election, how much I have appreciated his strength in the chair and his friendship over the years as we served together. I wish him all the best in his future endeavours, enjoying more time with his family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810171">When we look at this motion, we have to look at the litany of misleading comments made by the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> over his tenure since 2015. I think all of us are all too familiar with the travesty of the wrongful accusations and the decision by the minister to go on a witch hunt to stop the procurement of the <I>Asterix</I> for the Royal Canadian Navy, and how he threw retired Vice-Admiral Mark Norman under the bus. We know that through 2017 and into 2018, this escalated to a ridiculous level and ended up in the courts. The case, of course, was thrown out by the judge, because there just was not any evidence for it. It was an unnecessary attack on the honourable service and great reputation of a strong military leader, Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810172">However, we have to go back to the very beginning of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s tenure and look at what happened with his politically motivated withdrawal of our CF-18s from the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The minister was over there meeting with the Government of Iraq, as well as Kurdish officials in Erbil, and he told CBC on December 21, 2015, that he had not had one discussion about withdrawing our CF-18s from the fight. However, an access to information request on the record of a wire message in reference to the Minister of National Defence's meeting with the Iraqi minister of defence on December 20, 2015, just the day before he made that statement, says, “the Iraqi Minister of Defence was clearly focused on Canada's decision to withdraw its CF18 fighter jets from the coalition air strikes, asking [our Minister of National Defence] to reconsider this decision on numerous occasions”. That was the very first step in the minister's very misleading comments to the media and to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810173">We should not be surprised, because we also know that the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, back in July 2015 when he was running to be a member of Parliament for the first time, claimed on a local B.C. program, <I>Conversations That Matter</I>, that he was the architect of Operation Medusa in Afghanistan. He reiterated that in April 2017, when he was at a conference in New Delhi on conflict prevention and peace keeping in a changing world. He again said that he was the architect of Operation Medusa.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810174">Of course, he was a major back then and had numerous members in the command chain above him who were making the decisions, and there is no doubt that he provided great input and intelligence into how Operation Medusa was conducted, but to claim that he was more than the team is something that is not well regarded within the Canadian Armed Forces or by veterans across this country, and the minister had to apologize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810175">We also saw the minister take a shot at me back in 2017 over the cuts to tax-free allowances for forces members serving in Operation Impact while stationed in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan at that time. He claimed that it was the Conservative government that had taken away the tax-free allowance. I was able to get up on a question of privilege to point out that the initial assessments were made under the current Liberal government, and those cuts were made by this minister to hardship pay that was in effect back in 2014-15. Again, there was a finding that he misled the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810176">Now, the most egregious of all of this, and the one that is really rocking our Canadian Armed Forces right now, is, of course, the crisis of sexual misconduct. I will point out and ask the question: What do the Somalia affair, the decade of darkness and the crisis of sexual misconduct within the Canadian Armed Forces today have in common? It all comes down to weak Liberal leadership. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810177">We know that when the news broke that retired General Jonathan Vance, the former chief of the defence staff, had issues of sexual misconduct raised in March 2018, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> said at committee on February 19 of this year that he was “as shocked as everyone else at the allegations that were made public two weeks ago”. He was surprised to learn about these allegations, but then at the defence committee on March 3, 2021, the former ombudsman for national defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, Gary Walbourne, said at committee that “I personally met with [the minister] to address an allegation of inappropriate sexual behaviour within the senior ranks of the Canadian Armed Forces, specifically, against the chief of the defence staff, and to discuss my concerns about this allegation. This meeting happened on March 1, 2018.” That was three years before the story became news, when the minister was briefed by Gary Walbourne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810178">Gary Walbourne went on to say at committee that:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I did tell the minister what the allegation was. I reached into my pocket to show him the evidence I was holding, and he pushed back from the table and said, “No.” I don't think we exchanged another word. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810180">The minister refused the evidence, and we know that, at the defence committee on March 12, 2021, he then admitted, “I did meet with Mr. Walbourne”. The ombudsman brought up the concerns, but “He did not give me any details”, is what the minister was claiming. Yet, if we look at all of the information that flowed between the minister's chief of staff, Zita Astravas at the time, up into the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office on March 2, 2018, it all talked about this being a matter of sexual misconduct, which they actually described as “sexual harassment”. Elder Marques, Michael Wernick and Katie Telford, the chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, all knew that this was an issue of sexual misconduct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810181">Therefore, as the minister continues to dodge this and refuses to do the honourable thing and resign, and as long as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to back this inept behaviour by the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and refuses to fire him, it falls upon us as the House of Commons to censure this minister since he has consistently and repeatedly misled the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810182">I call upon all members of the House of Commons in all parties to censure this minister for his continued casual relationship with the truth.</ParaText>

That is the path and the party that the minister chose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810208">From that day on, he and I were no longer soldiers. We were now former military members who had become members of Parliament in the House of Commons, a political office. That is when the minister's problems began.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810209">The first step was in 2015. During the election campaign, a tragedy struck hearts around the world. The body of a little boy washed up on a beach in Italy. He was a Syrian refugee trying to flee Syria, which was under the grip of ISIS. Many refugees were seeking asylum. The Liberals opened up many new spots, and we were all for that. We needed to do something to help those refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810210">However, our country was also engaged in combat. Our armed forces and our air force were in Iraq and Syria fighting the enemy, ISIS. What did this government decide to do when it took office? It pulled our CF-18s out of the bombing campaign against ISIS. It stopped fighting the enemy, the enemy that caused the little boy to wash up on the beach and the Syrian refugees to flee in search of asylum. We could never understand that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810211">When we say that the minister is hiding the truth or misleading Canadians, we are talking about decisions. When we questioned him at length about the reasons behind the decision to pull our CF-18s out, the minister said that Iraq had agreed to it. Later, in an interview with an Iraqi minister, we learned that that was not true. Iraq was very disappointed with Canada's decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810212">The next step was a pivotal point in the career of a very talented military member, Vice-Admiral Norman, who was commander of the Royal Canadian Navy at the time. When he heard that the incoming Liberal government wanted to cancel the <I>Asterix</I> contract that had been awarded by the Conservative government, that was the last straw. Vice-Admiral Norman, a man who worked for his troops, the men and women of the Royal Canadian Navy, knew full well that the Conservative government decision to award the <I>Asterix</I> contract to Davie shipyard was the best solution to fix the problems in the navy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810213">We knew that the first decision of the Prime Minister and cabinet was to do everything in their power to cancel that contract. Vice-Admiral Norman did everything he could to prevent that from happening, and he paid the political price with his career. All he wanted to do was give the Royal Canadian Navy the tools it needed to do its job properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810214">What did the Minister of National Defence do to ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces were operating effectively around the world? That is the duty of a defence minister. It is about ensuring that his troops have the necessary tools to do their job. Instead, the minister contributed to the problem. He helped ensure that Vice-Admiral Norman became persona non grata. He ended up facing serious charges and the RCMP landed on his doorstep. It is appalling.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810215">This man was expected to be the next chief of the defence staff. He was going to be the commander of the Canadian Armed Forces. Instead, he was forced to retire. The government made sure of that by paying Vice-Admiral Norman's legal costs, which remain secret, so that he would just retire and stay quiet and so the whole thing would go away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810216">Is that the leadership we expect from a minister? Do we expect the minister to always say yes to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s nefarious decisions? A minister must be able to stand up and say that something will not work, that we cannot do that. However, the minister said nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810217">In 2018, the Canadian Armed Forces ombudsman went to the office of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> to tell him that there was a problem with the chief of the defence staff, General Vance. What did the minister do? He told the ombudsman that he did not want to know about it. The ombudsman was completely taken aback.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810218">The Canadian Armed Forces ombudsman told the minister that a victim had made allegations of sexual misconduct against the chief of the defence staff and that these allegations were not about 30-year-old incidents or incidents involving one too many beers, but were rather very serious allegations about recent incidents. What did the minister do? He did nothing. We learned about this three years later. We just learned about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810219">In 2018, during his tenure, the minister chose to hide the information. It gets worse. When the Conservatives were in power, they commissioned a report from Justice Marie Deschamps. She presented her report in 2015, in which she described attitude problems and sexual misconduct within the Canadian Armed Forces. What did the Minister of National Defence do with that report? Absolutely nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810220">The full report contained 10 recommendations that the minister could have implemented. He had access to all of the resources and tools he needed to protect women in the Canadian Armed Forces. He could have instituted a process to streamline complaints. That was not done, and we do not know why. We are asking questions, but we will never know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810221">Why were Justice Deschamps' recommendations never implemented? Was it because, again, the report had been commissioned by the Conservatives? Was it because people did not want these recommendations to be implemented? Was it because people did not want anyone to know? We have no idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810222">When all these problems are added together, the situation looks very serious. The Canadian Armed Forces are in turmoil. The head of the armed forces, the former chief of defence staff, is under investigation. The new chief of defence staff, who was in the position for one month, is under investigation. Generals are stepping down. Discipline and sound operations management within the Canadian Forces are evaporating. The soldiers and officers have no one to lead them. What is going on?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810223">On top of that, there is the case of Major-General Dany Fortin, a man I have known for a long time, a great soldier. He was put in charge of Canada's vaccine rollout, and he did an outstanding job. However, a complaint was filed against him. We do not know when or where it came from. Major-General Fortin was not informed of it. The decision was made to push him aside. The story went public, and he ended up getting all sorts of negative attention from the media, the public and the government without knowing what was happening or why. Today, this man is being forced to take legal action against the government and the Prime Minister to defend his reputation. Is that any way to treat the best members of the Canadian Armed Forces?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810224">Major-General Dany Fortin was brought in, in a public way, to help the country get out of the COVID-19 crisis, and how was he treated? He was not informed or even given a chance to explain a situation that may not even be true. We do not know. That is how the defence minister and this government operate, and that is why we can no longer trust the Minister of National Defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810225">I would like to remind the House that this has nothing to do with the soldier that the minister used to be. He served his country with distinction. However, he became a member of Parliament and a minister on October 19, 2015, and it has been a catastrophe ever since.</ParaText>

That matter was the subject of an investigation. The mandate was given in 2015, and the Norman affair blew up in 2017. It took the Conservatives about two years to react because they themselves knew that they had given him a legitimate mandate through Parliament, where we now sit. I would like to know the reason behind the two years of silence on the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810228">Regarding sexual misconduct, the Deschamps report was tabled in 2015, and various committees, including the Standing Committee on National Defence, studied it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810229">Why did the government not institute mechanisms to bring about positive change and transformation, instead of imputing motives?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810231">The other issue was the withdrawal of the CF-18s. The Canadian Armed Forced succeeded in liberating Mosul anyway. I knew that, and so did the Conservatives, so which is it? A success or a failure?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810233">With respect to Vice-Admiral Norman, it all started in 2014 and 2015, and we started debating it in 2017. Why was nothing done in the meantime? Because we only learned of the problem on the day the information got out. Ever since that time, we have been asking questions about this matter. We did not wait two years to do so, quite the contrary. As is the case with many files, we could not know everything there was to know. The Liberals have been in government since 2015. Therefore, we did not know any more about it than my colleague, since we did not have access to the documents and communications. As soon as we learned of the matter, we started asking questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810234">Regarding the Deschamps report, we will never understand why the government did not implement Marie Deschamps' recommendations as soon as it took office. If it had, things might be different today. </ParaText>

He presents this motion in an attempt to wage personal and partisan attacks rather than focusing on our members who serve in the Canadian Armed Forces. He is a veteran. I am a veteran, and I expect better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810244">I will not, and I repeat, will not gloss over the fact the defence team is going through a very difficult time right now, particularly those who are survivors of sexual harassment, assault and abuse of power. As the largest and most diverse employer in Canada, the defence team is a microcosm of our Canadian society. We see the same problems reflected in our organizations that we see play out in other areas of our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810245">We have had to reckon with inequality, systemic racism, sexual misconduct and abuse of power. It is uncomfortable. It is painful, and it is inconsistent with our ideals as Canadians and as human beings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810246">The experiences we have heard over the past few months from those who have experienced sexual harassment and assault in the Canadian Armed Forces is appalling. To every member of the Canadian Armed Forces, and to every person in the Department of National Defence who has been affected by sexual harassment and violence, I am truly sorry. Whether it was recently, 10 years ago, 20 years ago or 30 years ago, we were not there to support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810247">As somebody who has put on the uniform, I know the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence need to do better. We all need to do better. I know our current reporting systems are not enough. Too often, people do not feel able to report misconduct our of fear of reprisal and retribution. This has to change, and this will change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810248">It is why I asked Madam Louise Arbour, former Supreme Court justice, to lead an independent external comprehensive review of our institutional policies and culture. Over the coming months, we expect Madam Arbour to provide concrete recommendations on how the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence can set up an independent external reporting system for defence team members that meets the needs of those who have been impacted by sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810249">We know we have a lot more to do to regain our members' trust. We are committed to making a lasting change, one that sheds the toxic and outdated values, practices and policies that harmed our people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810250">This motion from the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> is not about supporting our members. In fact, the opposition had the opportunity time and time again in this very Parliament to be part of the solution. Instead, opposition members have consistently chosen to obstruct the progress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810251">In the past weeks, the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and his party voted against almost a quarter of a billion dollars to help eliminate sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces in budget 2021. They voted against supporting peer-to-peer services. They voted against increasing access to the sexual misconduct response centre for members of the Canadian Armed Forces. In fact, the leader of the official opposition and his party voted against our commitment to implement new external oversight mechanisms to bring greater independence to the processes of reporting and adjudicating sexual misconduct within the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810252">This is staggering hypocrisy from the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party, which should not be unexpected from the Conservatives.

              <ParaText id="6810253">After years of cuts from the Conservatives, our air force could not generate enough aircraft to answer our NATO and NORAD commitments at the same time. We are committed to procuring 88 advanced fighter jets to show our friends and allies we will be there for them when we are called upon, and we have stepped up. How they chose the number of 65, I do not know, but I am going to guess they needed to cut. They needed to balance their budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810255">When the Conservatives sat back, Liberals stepped forward. We worked with the U.S., NATO, regional partners and allies to increase peace and stability in the region. Just a few months ago, we announced that we would extend our work in the Middle East by deploying up to 850 Canadian Armed Forces personnel to support the global coalition, the NATO mission in Iraq and capacity-building activities in Jordan and Lebanon because we know this is a regional issue. Canada will remain a reliable partner in multinational operations around the world.</ParaText>

We want to talk about preventing things from happening. We learned from media reports that the leader of the official opposition himself was aware of allegations of sexual misconduct regarding General Vance prior to his appointment as chief of the defence staff, an allegation from the general's time in Gagetown, as it was reported. It was an allegation that the leader of the official opposition said that he had investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810257"> The former national security advisor, Richard Fadden, said to a parliamentary committee that this is not true. Let me quote Mr. Fadden. Speaking of when General Vance was stationed in Naples, he said, “I did a bit of an inquiry into what was happening with a lady who subsequently became his wife. That was the extent of the involvement.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810258">After this non-investigation, it seems that the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service received political pressure to stop its investigation into Vance, an investigation that just happen to end right before his swearing in as chief of the defence staff under the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810259">The <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> continues to say that he passed along sexual misconduct allegations by General Vance in July 15. He continues to claim that those were looked into, despite evidence to the contrary. I ask this House, how can the Leader of the Opposition's story be credible if General Vance was appointed after no investigation of the knowledge that the leader had? Almost immediately after the allegations were made, pressure was brought to bear and the investigation was suddenly dropped. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810260">Unlike the Conservatives, I know how important our people in the Canadian Armed Forces are. That is why they are at the very centre of our defence policy. Chapter number one states that.</ParaText>

Our defence policy, “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, commits to promoting diversity and inclusion as core institutional values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810262">We have taken a number of steps to increase representation of women and other unrepresented populations at all levels of the organization. Right now, Lieutenant-General Carignan is the chief of professional conduct and culture at the organization. She and her team will unify and coordinate the ongoing and evolving efforts to create positive and lasting change across the defence team.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810263">At NATO's Allied Joint Forces Command Naples, we have Lieutenant-General Joe Paul, a member of the Huron-Wendat First Nation as deputy command. While he is there, he will help to prepare, plan and conduct military operations in order to preserve the peace, security, and territorial integrity of all NATO alliance members.

We are addressing all forms of hateful conduct in our organizations with anti-racism and anti-harassment efforts.

The act enshrines victims' rights into the code of service discipline. We are working with our members so the regulations for that bill meet the needs of the survivors, rather than the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810269">Earlier this month, we tabled a third independent review of the National Defence Act by former Supreme Court justice Morris Fish. This is one of the most comprehensive independent reviews of the military justice system in a decade. Justice Fish's recommendations provide one of the largest overhauls of the National Defence Act and the Canadian military justice system in recent memory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810270">I have accepted the 107 recommendations in principle. As we speak, we have already begun to implement 36 of those recommendations to further improve the military justice system to bring greater confidence to our members, who wear the maple leaf on their shoulder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810271">All this work is in addition to the independent external comprehensive review that former Justice Louise Arbour is leading to help us build on and refine our efforts to address and prevent sexual misconduct in our organizations. Over the coming months, Madam Arbour will provide concrete recommendations for how the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence could set up an independent external reporting system for defence team members that meets the needs of those who have been impacted by sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810272">This system needs to be focused on those who have been impacted by misconduct, be responsive to their needs and be outside the chain of command and the Department of National Defence. Any less cannot be accepted, and any less will not be accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810273">Madam Arbour and her team will provide significant direction on how we must evolve to support affected people, and how we can ensure that every incident is handled appropriately. Part of this work also includes looking into the current structures in the Canadian Armed Forces, the Department of National Defence and the sexual misconduct response centre to see how we could strengthen them to provide greater confidence to those who need support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810274">We will also examine the performance evaluation promotion system in the Canadian Armed Forces with a focus on how leaders are selected and trained. This review will also look at the military justice system's policies, procedures and practices to see how we could make this system more responsive to the needs of those who have experienced misconduct while holding perpetrators accountable. As Madam Arbour does this important work, she will be able to provide interim recommendations to the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence, and we commit to acting upon it immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810275"> As we continue our work with the defence team, we have created a new organization of professional conduct and culture under the leadership of its chief, General Carignan. This will be responsible for carrying out and creating the conditions for cultural transformation by unifying, integrating, and coordinating the ongoing efforts across the Department of National Defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810276">Their goal is to ensure that our actions and behaviour reflect the very best parts of our organizations of Canadian society. Their efforts will closely align with the work being carried out by the external review and will be informed by best practices, as well as experts, advocates and those who have lived experiences, inside and outside our institutions, at all levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810277"> We are dedicated to creating lasting cultural change across the defence team, change that is enduring and that meets the needs of those who have experienced sexual harassment and violence. The motion that the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has put forward does nothing to help those in the Canadian Armed Forces. It is more focused on personal attacks and petty games, something that I have unfortunately been far too accustomed to. That is okay.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810313">It is no secret that the Bloc Québécois will vote in favour of the motion. The Bloc Québécois has already asked for the resignation of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> because of his ongoing failure to address sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces.

As set out in the motion, the minister committed a number of mistakes, although the most serious is protecting General Vance and attempting to cover up his bungling, including failing to implement the recommendations of the 2015 Deschamps report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810315">As the critic for status of women and gender equality, I will start by addressing these issues in my speech. I am very sensitive to these issues, and I will speak with due respect for the victims who testified at the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. I will then address a few other scandals that have rocked the Canadian Armed Forces. I will close with some suggestions to help improve trust in the armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810316">First, while the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> was supposed to implement the 2015 Deschamps report, it appears that he has done nothing and that he even tried to bury General Vance’s file. I cannot believe that I am still here going over the entire unfortunate story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810317">Former justice Marie Deschamps released a scathing report on March 27, 2015, concerning what she considered widespread sexual misconduct in the armed forces and the sexist culture that turned a blind eye to such misconduct. The report had been commissioned in the wake of accusations against Warrant Officer André Gagnon, who sexually assaulted a subordinate, Corporal Stéphanie Raymond, in December 2011. Corporal Raymond appeared before the committee, testifying to the harm she has suffered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810318">Corporal Raymond filed a complaint against Warrant Officer Gagnon in 2012, but her chain of command turned against her, and she was eventually dismissed for misconduct in 2013. Warrant Officer Gagnon was acquitted in 2014, but, in 2021, after Corporal Raymond appealed the ruling, he finally pleaded guilty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810319">Corporal Raymond’s situation, and the accusations she brought against the armed forces, led to former justice Marie Deschamps’ report. The report contained 10 recommendations, the most important of which was to make the complaint reporting system independent of the armed forces and of the Department of National Defence. That was in 2015, and, although we are now in 2021, nothing has been done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810320">When she testified before the Standing Committee on National Defence in February 2021, Marie Deschamps said that very little had been done since the release of her report in 2015 and that little had really changed. She repeated these statements before the Standing Committee on the Status of Women last March.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810321">I will nevertheless take the time to point out that these allegations are not new, and that they began under the Conservative government, since it was in April 2015 that Jonathan Vance was named as the future chief of the defence staff. Allegations of sexual misconduct had been raised against him shortly before his appointment. A few months later, in July 2015, the former minister of veterans affairs and current <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the opposition</Affiliation> asked his chief of staff to talk to Ray Novak about another allegation against General Vance. This allegation involved an inappropriate relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810322">General Vance denied all misconduct, and the investigations went nowhere, since there was no evidence. The military police apparently also investigated the case. On July 17, 2015, General Vance was appointed chief of the defence staff, and one of his first policies was to roll out Operation Honour, which sought to put an end to sexual misconduct. That takes guts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810323">How is it possible that General Vance, who was the subject of very serious allegations, was appointed, given his role and his mandate as chief of the defence staff, as the person in charge of doing something against sexual misconduct?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810324">In fact, the very same day that General Vance become chief of the defence staff, the military police decided to drop the investigation against the man who had now become their boss. That is quite the coincidence.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810325">The operation, which was abandoned by the current chief of defence staff, had moderate impact, but it obviously had no effect on the senior officers who were above all that. In short, the Conservatives decided to appoint someone against whom accusations had been made when he was the boss of the Canadian Armed Forces, when they knew that his mandate would be to address sexual misconduct in the forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810326">Now let us look at some of the allegations under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810327">On March 1, 2018, then ombudsman Gary Walbourne met privately with the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. Walbourne attempted to discuss a case of sexual misconduct involving Vance. The victim did not want to go any further in the process because she was afraid of reprisals, preventing the ombudsman from going forward. However, the ombudsman, who had credible evidence against Vance, wanted to show it to the minister, who categorically refused to even look at it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810328">The ombudsman wanted the minister to intervene to protect the victim, since she was Vance's subordinate and he could wipe out her career with the snap of a finger. The minister was unreceptive and hostile. Apparently, he categorically refused to look at Walbourne's evidence and left the meeting abruptly. The minister then referred the case to the Privy Council Office. After that, Walbourne tried to talk to the minister 12 times, but the minister refused to meet with him, and Walbourne retired a few months later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810329">The Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office exchanged emails about the situation. After that, the situation deteriorated and other facts came to light. The scandal was made public in February 2021, when Global News reported accusations of misconduct against Vance, including his relationship with a subordinate and obscene emails exchanged in 2012 with a much younger servicewoman. The woman who had been in a relationship with Vance publicly stated that she had been threatened by Vance on several occasions. Vance believed himself to be untouchable. He said that he controlled the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810330">The standing committee on national defence decided to investigate the allegations against Vance. The Minister of Defence appeared before the committee a few times and contradicted himself. Moreover, the Liberals did not hesitate to obstruct the investigation to prevent Liberal employees Zita Astravas and Elder Marques from being called to testify. I was personally there when I was a substitute member of the committee. It was a sad time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810331">From Elder Marques' testimony, we know that everyone around the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation> was aware of the situation, but the Prime Minister himself continues to deny any knowledge of it. When other employees were called by the House, the Liberals sent the Minister of Defence instead. They said that they did not want their employees to testify.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810332">The Liberals willingly turned a blind eye to the allegations. The Liberals decided to ignore the issue, while the minister flatly refused to meet with the former ombudsman 12 times and would not even look at the evidence, claiming he did not want to interfere in the investigation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810333">The Prime Minister's entourage knew that there had been allegations against Vance, even if the Prime Minister himself did not have all the details. Everyone around him suspected that these allegations involved sexual misconduct. There were actually emails that mentioned sexual misconduct directly. The Minister of Defence even said that the nature of the accusations against Vance did not matter and what mattered was to take action. Well, the Liberals did absolutely nothing. They did not even implement Justice Deschamps’s main recommendation, namely to make the complaint process completely independent of the military to receive all complaints of sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810334">The facts speak for themselves. As of today, four generals have had complaints of misconduct brought against them. In 2021, six years after Justice Deschamps’s report was released, the Liberals decided to appoint former justice Louise Arbour to conduct another investigation into how to improve the system. That should have been done in 2015, not in 2021. The minister never took the situation seriously. Only when he had his back to the wall did he decide to do something, but only to save his own skin, after pressure from the opposition parties in the House and the committee investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810335">To add insult to injury, the second-in-command of the Canadian Armed Forces, Lieutenant-General Mike Rouleau, decided to play golf with former general Vance, despite the fact that Vance is under investigation by the military police and the military police is under Lieutenant-General Rouleau’s command. This incident led to Rouleau’s resignation and brought to light the federal government’s failure to implement an independent system to handle cases of sexual misconduct. The Liberals have done nothing since 2015 and that inaction has consequences, as this incident shows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810336">Since my time is running out, I will not have time to talk about everything I would have liked to address in my speech. I have been studying this case in the Standing Committee on the Status of Women and the Standing Committee on National Defence for months now. There is so much going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810337">In closing, the Liberals claim that they are unaware of the nature of the allegations against Vance, with the Minister of Defence even saying that the nature of the allegations does not matter. All these events have further eroded the public’s and women’s confidence and harmed diversity, in particular. We must consider the victims. The Liberals and their Minister of Defence failed to act to restore confidence in the armed forces.</ParaText>

Her superior officer, with whom she had had a relationship, asked her to have an abortion to keep the matter quiet. She refused, and was asked to resign. This is still happening in 2021. We must act for the sake of the victims.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810366">I do not think anyone in the House will be surprised to learn that we will vote in favour of this motion, in light of its troubling elements. The facts have accumulated over time, which has led to a loss of confidence. That is why the Bloc Québécois is calling for the resignation of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810367">We look at all these things that have happened, but the last straw was the whole issue of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces. The situation has completely deteriorated and the minister has mismanaged it from the start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810368">As we know, General Vance was forced to retire and it was not until after he retired that we finally learned about the allegations of sexual misconduct that were made against him, which triggered an investigation by the Standing Committee on National Defence, as well as a study by the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. When two committees look into an issue at the same time, it is obviously a big deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810369">Shortly thereafter we also learned that General Vance's replacement, Admiral McDonald, also had to step down, also because of allegations of sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810370">This has been going on at the upper echelons of the military for some time and it is troubling since the current Minister of National Defence was notified of the problem by Gary Walbourne, who was national defence and armed forces ombudsman at the time, but has since retired. He went to the minister to advise him of a major complaint against the chief of the defence staff, General Vance. It was serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810371">The minister told him he did not want to know about it, that he did not want anyone to talk to him about it, that he did not want to see the evidence and that the ombudsman should instead go talk to the appropriate authorities. In fact, the minister refused to look at what the ombudsman wanted to show him and then refused to meet with him again thereafter. The minister adopted this culture of wilful ignorance, choosing to turn a blind eye and act like nothing happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810372">Unfortunately, even though some people on his staff appear to have passed the information along, it is hard to know who was aware of what and when. There are different, contradictory versions of events. When asked, the minister initially said that he was not aware. That is completely untrue, however, because we have now learned that he was aware. He met with the ombudsman, who wanted to talk to him about the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810373">Then, the minister started saying that he was not aware of the nature of the complaint in question. However, once again, Mr. Walbourne said that he very clearly told the minister about the nature of the complaint. Furthermore, media reports revealed that the public servants had emailed each other, proving that the minister was aware of the nature of the complaint, in spite of what he had been claiming. Worse yet, the minister then claimed that the nature of the complaint was not ultimately an important factor.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810374">That is how he chose to handle it. Rather than apologizing and telling us that he did not give us the right information and that he tried to hide the fact that he did not take the action he should have, he decided to minimize the situation and tried to convince us that, ultimately, it was not that important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810375">It is especially disappointing to see a minister behave like that, particularly because of the message that it sends to the Canadian Armed Forces. The message is that this is not serious, not important. The government is going to close its eyes to complaints. The government is going to say that it does not want anything to do with this sort of thing and that it does not want to get involved because politicians should not interfere with investigations. That is the minister's position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810376">Nevertheless, we asked the former ombudsman if it would have constituted interference to meet with him to look at the evidence. At that time, there was not even an investigation under way. He said that it would not. The ombudsman that replaced him and who is in office today told us that it would not be interfering at all and that is exactly what he would have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810377">We asked the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service or CFNIS if it would have constituted interference for the minister to do his job by simply looking at the evidence and agreeing to meet with the ombudsman. He said no, not at all. We also asked the CFNIS whether it would have constituted interference for the minister to request an investigation. Once again, the CFNIS said no and added that that would only be the case if the minister sought to undermine the investigation. However, it must be said that the minister did basically undermine the investigation by not asking the CFNIS to investigate and by refusing to obtain the information. However, there was no investigation. It was easier that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810378">We then learned that the information did make the rounds. The Privy Council Office was informed of the situation. One of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s advisers, Elder Marques, was apparently informed of the situation and was asked to investigate, at least to some extent. The Prime Minister's chief of staff was also informed of the situation. However, one after the other, they all claimed at the beginning, when speaking with the Prime Minister, that they did not know and his staff did not know. We were getting different versions all the time, and information was coming out in dribs and drabs. Unfortunately, we are up against a government and a party that are trying to undermine the work of the Standing Committee on National Defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810379">I have been a member of that committee for months, and our work has been stalled for months now. Every time a witness is called or a witness expresses a desire to appear, the government and Liberal members filibuster. As a result, nothing is moving forward and nothing is getting done. The filibustering is only getting worse. It has been about three or four weeks since we have been able to have a single meeting where we have intelligent discussions and actually do any work. We are just wasting time. This is especially frustrating because this government prides itself on being a democratic government when, really, it is just undermining the committee's work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810380">Why did he decide to hinder the work of the committee? That is the question. Why does he absolutely not want us to know what happened? Since the witnesses kept contradicting each other, after we heard the last one, we decided to invite more. We asked for the Minister of National Defence's chief of staff so that he could give us his version of the facts, but that was blocked. We cannot speak to him. On one occasion, the minister even showed up in place of his chief of staff to tell us what he would have said. That is something. He knew what the other guy was going to say. Why are the Liberals so scared of what he might tell us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810381">For now, what we have observed is that the Minister of National Defence was not up to the task. He did not do his job, and, because of that, to protect itself and to prevent things from going smoothly, the Liberal Party has been systematically obstructing the investigation. The Liberal members of the committee are preventing us from doing our job. If I were a citizen and I saw that, I would be really angry and frustrated. In addition, what message does this send to people who work in the Canadian Armed Forces?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810382">What message does this send to women? The message is that, when things like this happen, when a minister is not up to the task and when there are unacceptable situations in the Canadian Armed Forces, the Standing Committee on National Defence will be prevented from doing its job because the government wants to protect its friends, and because it wants to protect those who did not do what they should have done. That is what is really going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810383">We have a <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who is not up to the task. Rather than do his job, when he could have implemented the recommendations of the 2015 Deschamps report, the minister decided to go back to square one instead. I do not even know if he read the Deschamps report, which contained good recommendations and indicated that the situation in the armed forces was hard to believe. He decided to go back to square one and commission another report that they also may not look at in order to stall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810384">For example, he allowed Mr. Vance to take charge of Operation Honour, when, in the end, he was setting the wolf loose on the sheep. He gave him a raise. Worse than that, we found out that, in the meantime, the second in command of the armed forces, Lieutenant-General Mike Rouleau, who is also vice chief of the defence staff and head of the military police, went to play golf with the retired General Vance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810385">All this shows just how much the minister's inaction created a climate of impunity in the armed forces, and that is totally unacceptable.</ParaText>

Would the Bloc members apply the same principles to the behaviour of the leader of the official opposition, given that he had the opportunity to deal with this matter when he was part of the Stephen Harper cabinet? That government's failure is what ultimately advanced General Vance. Does he believe there should be any consequences today because of the inaction of the leader of the official opposition or does he believe he did the right thing back then?</ParaText>

It very much undermines the trust of the women and men who serve in uniform in our parliamentary institutions to watch the Liberals keep a minister in place who continues to lose their respect and now see parliamentarians from the Liberal side trying to hide that and being complicit in the cover-up of the minister failing to act upon the sexual misconduct allegations against General Vance three years ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810403">I am honoured today to speak to this motion. I am the granddaughter of Bert McCoy. He was a gunner in the Royal Canadian Air Force who always lived a very large life, including being shot down over Belgium during the Second World War. He spent two years in the underground trying to fight his way back to my grandmother and my mother in Canada. An interesting part about this story is that he had to escape from some German soldiers, and speaking French saved his life. I sometimes think that the reason I fight so hard for Franco-Albertans is that French saved the life of my grandfather.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810404">He was a magnificent man, and I am proud to stand today in his honour, but I have to say that how we protect and stand up for the women and men who defend this country defines us as parliamentarians. It is one of our most fundamental duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810405">We ask members of the armed forces to risk their lives, to be away from loved ones, and to defend all of us and others around the world. There can be no more important thing than those women and men knowing that we have their backs. Women and men have lost confidence that this <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has their backs. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces have heard the minister mislead them. They have heard the minister mislead parliamentarians, the media and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810406">I do not want to be harsh on any member of the House. I understand that we all have very difficult jobs, and I honestly believe that almost all members want to do what is best for Canadians, but the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has acted in a way that requires a response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810407">In 2016, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> quashed an inquiry into Canadian transfers of detainees to local custody in Afghanistan, where they faced torture. An inquiry would have revealed why the transfers were not stopped and why these war crimes were never reported. In making this decision, the minister was in an apparent conflict of interest. He served as an intelligence officer in Afghanistan at the time of the transfers and would have had knowledge of the torture of detainees. No public inquiry was ever conducted into Canada's role and responsibility with regard to the transfer of Afghan detainees. More recently, the minister turned a blind eye to evidence of war crimes committed by Iraqi troops being trained by Canadians as part of Operation Impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810408">In 2017, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> claimed to be the architect of Operation Medusa. This was not true. He exaggerated his role, which of course is an affront to those members who fought in Afghanistan. Honour means telling the truth. Honour means not taking credit for the work done by others. The minister stole honour that was not his.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810409">Despite the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s poor record, this is not just an issue with the Minister of National Defence. The focus on the Minister of National Defence is necessary, and I will support this motion, but I want to outline why I believe the inexcusable actions by the government, in relation to its support for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, are not the issue of just one minister. In fact, this is not the issue of just one party. There is an insidious and dangerous reality that goes farther than one minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810410">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has failed the women and men in uniform. The Liberal government has failed the women and men in uniform. There is a pattern of looking the other way. There is a pattern of not doing the work that needs to be done to meet our international obligations to report war crimes and torture. As always, the failures of many do not affect the government. They affect our brave servicewomen and men in this country, and they affect those who need our help around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810411">One of the most shocking failures was the inability to protect women in the military from sexual harassment and violence.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810412">The government has been in power for six years, and in those six years there have been 581 sexual assaults in the military, with 221 incidents of sexual harassment logged. This abject failure to protect women is a stain on our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810413">Women are tired of being told to be patient. They are tired of being told their concerns have been heard and then nothing changes. As important as the Liberals say the issue is, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not even include an explicit mention of dealing with sexual misconduct in the 2015, 2019 or 2021 mandate letters to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810414">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810415">I spoke earlier today about a survivor who called my office because she did not trust her member of Parliament. She did not know where to turn, so she phoned my office. I spoke to her for over an hour about her concerns that her anonymity and safety would be compromised, and that for her having a career in the Canadian Armed Forces was now impossible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810416">This is a woman who has served our country, and she does not even feel safe telling the government about the concerns she has as a survivor of sexual harassment within the military. I did not know what to say to her. I did not know how to help her. I did not know how to relieve her concerns. I did not know what to do, because I do not have confidence that the government cares about sexual harassment survivors. I do not have confidence that the Conservative government, when it was in power, had the best interests of women in our military at heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810417">Can members imagine being a survivor, and being brave and strong enough to come forward with that story of survival, and then finding out that General Vance was golfing with the people who were investigating him? The old boys' club nonsense that she is trying to stop and prevent, because she wants to make our military better, results in them going for a golf game. How old boys' club is that? How inexcusable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810418">These women do not get action. They get another inquiry. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> must answer for this, but more importantly the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must answer for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810419">As I said, my confidence in the government has failed, but I do not believe the Conservative government acted better. I am sad to say the Conservative government under Stephen Harper, with Jason Kenney as the minister of defence, bears the same guilt. Jason Kenney knew General Vance was accused of sexual harassment, and unbelievably he appointed the general to lead Operation Honour. In what world is it reasonable to have somebody accused or suspected of sexual harassment be in charge of the investigation into sexual harassment? The absurdity is shocking to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810420">While I am disappointed in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and the Liberal government, I find it incredibly rich that the Conservatives have the gall to stand in this place and not acknowledge the role their government has played in harming the women of our Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810421">There is enough blame to go around. Government after government has failed women in this country. They have created a toxic work environment where women cannot work safely in our military. Is anyone surprised that enrolment is low? Can anyone be surprised that women do not flock to participate in our military?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810422">In conclusion, I will support this motion because the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> needs to answer for his actions, but I want to reiterate that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the minister, the government and the opposition bear the burden of knowing they have not protected women in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810437">To quote Shakespeare's <I>Hamlet</I>, something is rotten in the state of Denmark. I get the impression that something is rotten in the office of the Minister of National Defence. He has abandoned the men and women of the armed forces time and again. He has engaged in cover-ups, tried to ignore the facts, and tried to sweep things under the rug, and he misled the parliamentary committee when he was answering questions. The members of the armed forces deserve much better than that. They are courageous men and women. They take risks. They are prepared to make sacrifices, and they keep us and our country safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810438">In my opinion, the men and women who serve in the armed forces must be respected. They deserve better. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> abandoned them and chose to turn a blind eye to serious allegations, including allegations of sexual misconduct, and other problems, such as the things that happened in Iraq. He always tried to cover up instead. It seems that the minister's modus operandi is to avoid fixing the problem, look away or sweep problems under the rug. For him, it is out of sight, out of mind. However, that is not how it works.</ParaText>

It makes me think about my colleague from Edmonton Strathcona, who spoke of her grandfather. Her story was very interesting. These people have the right to work in a safe and healthy environment.

In my riding, Rosemont—La Petite‑Patrie, there is a legion, and I have met with its members a few times. I am not as close to the issue as some of my colleagues. However, I spent three days on a frigate between Halifax, Nova Scotia, and St. John's, Newfoundland. For three days, I lived with sailors on the HMCS <I>Ville de Québec</I>, which, I must say, is a very nice name. I met extremely dedicated professional men and women who want to do their job well and who have absolutely unbelievable stories to tell, including about counter-piracy operations off the cost of East Africa. I salute their work and their bravery. If I mention this, it is because I am trying to address this situation as a matter of women's and workers' rights.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810447">I think this tells us that we must be able to see those with different lives and different challenges who are suffering. Right now, in the Canadian Armed Forces, there are people who are struggling and who are suffering. That is why there have been allegations of misconduct and investigations. Unfortunately, the Minister of Defence, instead of trying to put himself in the shoes of those who are struggling and suffering, preferred to try to bury the situation time and again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810448">He did that in the case of the investigation into the allegations of sexual misconduct, but that was not the first time. There are things that trouble me immensely about the current Minister of Defence's instincts. Remember that, before this whole unbelievable story, there were videos of Iraqi military personnel committing crimes against Iraqi women, including sexual assault, rape and maybe even murder. What was the Minister of Defence's response? He told us not to watch the videos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810449">In 2016, after becoming Minister of Defence, he decided to set aside an investigation into the transfer of prisoners in Afghanistan when they were handed over to local authorities who were known to routinely practise torture. This is a complete violation of all of our international commitments and the Geneva Conventions. We should not be transferring prisoners if we think they are going to be mistreated or tortured.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810450">There is overwhelming proof that the minister is incompetent, and that he is not deserving of our confidence or of that of the House. For these reasons, the NDP is asking for his resignation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810497">Madam Speaker, Canada's military is in crisis on the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation>'s watch. An institution that has been revered for over a hundred years, Canada's military has liberated occupied nations, fought for democracy, freedom and peace, and brought honour and respect to our country and Canadian citizens. Now it is facing some of the darkest days in its history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810498">Canada's military is entrusted with protecting and preserving Canadian values, but it must also embody them. However, serious abuse of power, sexual misconduct and discrimination at the highest levels in Canada's military continue unchecked, and the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have failed to act. That is why today's opposition day motion calls on the House of Commons to censure the Minister of Defence, and why it is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810499">Members of the government will cry that today's motion amounts to nothing more than petty partisan politics. That, in itself, is evidence that the current government understands neither its sworn obligation, nor the dire situation that Canada's military is in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810500">Members of Parliament are elected to govern, and governing is much more than merely passing laws. Governing, at its most fundamental, is about ensuring that those entrusted with leading the country embody the values of honesty and integrity that Canadians expect, and are held to account when they have broken that most sacred trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810501">In his direction to ministers in 2015, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> charged them with “[c]reating the culture of integrity and accountability that allows [them] to earn and keep the trust of Canadians”. The Prime Minister went on to say, “Whether a Minister has discharged responsibilities appropriately is a matter of political judgment by Parliament.” Therefore, any attempt to characterize today's opposition day motion as partisan or petty politics must be vehemently rejected. It is the role of Parliament to judge a minister, and not one we take lightly. Today, this House of Commons is fulfilling that most difficult and serious responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810502">The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> has not acted with integrity and accountability. Instead, he has consistently misrepresented the facts, refused to answer direct questions, failed to implement important changes to improve the military's culture and turned a blind eye to serious allegations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810503">In 2018, allegations of serious misconduct were made against the former chief of the defence staff, General Vance. For three years, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> knew, and key officials in the Prime Minister's Office, the Privy Council and the minister's office knew, and they all did nothing. No one else would have known, if two parliamentary committees, the defence committee and the status of women committee, had not decided to study this serious military misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810504">What Canadians have learned through the testimony at those committees and in the media has simply shaken us to our core: hours and hours of jarring testimony detailing accounts of abusive power, misogyny, rape, sexual harassment and discrimination. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810505">We heard testimony of investigations that were never carried out or were covered up, evidence that was lost or tampered with, and serious crimes that were pleaded down to an administrative slap on the wrist, purged from the records and simply forgotten. We heard from victims who were threatened into silence and themselves blamed for what had happened to them. They told us how their careers were destroyed and they were drummed out of the military. Perhaps most tragically, we heard from victims who believe they will never be able to get justice for what happened to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810506">To quote retired Colonel Bernie Boland, “The entire institutional weight, influence, power, intellect and knowledge is directed against [victims] rather than what it's purportedly supposed to be.... Equal justice for all is not being applied here at all.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810507">All of this, in Canada's military? How could this possibly happen in a country like Canada, where justice, accountability and the rule of law are our foundation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810508">The former chief of the defence staff, General Vance, the highest military officer; then his replacement, Admiral McDonald; Vice-Admiral Edmundson; General Fortin; General Rouleau; and Vice-Admiral Baines are all either under police investigation or have had to step aside for questionable conduct. Even more general and flag officers are complicit, through their actions or their silence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810509"> The failure of Canada's military starts at the top of the chain of command, and the top is the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation>. Under the National Defence Act, the defence minister is responsible for the management and direction of the Canadian Forces, and it is his duty to hold those at the most senior levels to the highest standards. A military has great power. It is the one group of people in Canadian society entrusted with the ability to bear arms and to commit acts of violence on behalf of the country. In a democracy, citizens need to know that the military is held in check by our elected officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810510">The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> had a responsibility to take swift and immediate action regarding the allegations against Vance, but for three years he did nothing. While he may not have conducted the investigation himself, it was up to him to ensure that one was done. As elected officials, our loyalty is to country first, before party and before individuals; we are here to act in the best interest of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810511"> That is what we also ask of our military, and Lieutenant-Commander Trotter risked his personal well-being to do what is right. He said, “as an officer in the Canadian Armed Forces I swore an oath to Queen and country to fulfill my duties, and there's the old adage of service before self. There may be blowback. There may be career implications”. He further stated, “My personal conviction as an officer of the Canadian Armed Forces is that I will put the service and my service members above my own needs and safety.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810512">Canadians rely on ministers to do the same, to put this country and Parliament before themselves and to accept responsibility when they fail to do so. However, after months of questions in the House and numerous appearances at committee, not once has the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> accepted any responsibility. Not once has he said he should have done something differently and, most important, not once has he committed to holding accountable those who have failed in their duty. Lasting change will only come when those who have failed are held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810513">Governing does not mean to delegate and disappear. It means ensuring that government departments and public servants deliver the services Canadians need, to the standards they expect and in a manner that brings honour and pride to Canada as a nation. When it comes to the conduct at the highest level of the Canadian Armed Forces, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say it is not up to them.</ParaText>

The defence minister has clearly shown that he will not accept responsibility. He will not act honourably, admit he has failed in his duties and resign, and the Prime Minister will not hold him accountable and fire him. Rather than standing up for women, the Prime Minister has reinforced an entrenched and toxic military culture.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6810536">Madam Speaker, unfortunately, what we have been listening to is very much political partisanship. The Conservatives, in particular, have spared no expense in looking into individuals and attacking their character. We have seen that virtually since 2015, and nothing has changed. Even during the pandemic, the Conservative Party remains focused not so much on policy, but on character assassination. I am disappointed once again, but not surprised, by the behaviour of the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810537">I was in opposition for many years, as I said before. Never before have I seen an opposition party attack personalities to the degree that this party has in opposition, even at a time when Canadians want us to work together. It is also disappointing to see the Bloc and the NDP join forces with the official opposition. I refer to it as “the unholy alliance”. By joining forces, they are trying to give a false impression to undermine the public's trust in our institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810538">I served in the Canadian Forces, albeit for a short period of time of just over three years. I enjoyed every day that I served in the forces posted out in Alberta. This is a government that has demonstrated a very strong, powerful commitment to the Canadian Forces. We have seen legislation, we have seen budget initiatives and we have seen a <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, who I would argue is second to no other in recent memory, commit to building a stronger, healthier Canadian Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810539">For those who have been following the debate on the floor of the House of Commons or in the committees, I will note what the unholy alliance of opposition parties is trying to accomplish. I suggest that the opposition, collectively, is feeling frustrated, and has joined forces to do what the Conservatives have been doing since 2015. It is quite upsetting that they have chosen the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810540">I remember when Jason Kenney heckled across the chamber to say he needed translation for English. That is where things started getting pretty rough for the opposition, and Jason did not want to back down. He wanted to take his shots at the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810541">As my colleague put in a question, this issue is not new. Sexual harassment and abuse of power are very serious issues in the forces. This was true back in the eighties, when I was there. I suspect members will find that they predate that time, and I suspect that they will likely continue. However, there are things we can do to minimize them and hopefully get them out of the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810542">We have a <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> who understands the members of the forces, so when the Conservatives attack his character, I take exception to it. Virtually from day one they have been attacking this particular minister on a personal level. I note Jason Kenney again, and what I would suggest to be racial comments from him.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810543">Prior to being the Minister of National Defence, he was a detective with the Vancouver Police Department. Prior to that, which is how most know him quite well, he had a role in our Canadian Forces. I will expand on that a little later. He was the first Sikh Minister of National Defence and was also in command of a Canadian Army Reserve regiment. Those are just some of things people will find about the minister if they do a very basic google search. To say that he should relieved of his responsibilities or should step down is just silly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810544"> When I look at what we have been able to accomplish through the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, the investments today and the commitments for tomorrow for members of our Canadian Forces, I will compare that any day to what Stephen Harper and the Conservatives did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810545"> I made reference to the fact that sexual harassment did exist. There is an imbalance. There is the shame and the exploitation. They are very real. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> has been very clear that we are committed to making the much-needed institutional and cultural changes that the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces need, and we continue to make that commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810546">We have invested in the health, safety and well-being of all our defence team members. We have committed well over $200 million in the most recent budget toward eliminating sexual misconduct. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has indicated that we will look for ways in the coming days to ensure there is an independent system established to deal with this issue. The minister has been very clear to those who want to listen and do not have the selective hearing my Conservative friends across the way do that he has absolutely no tolerance, zero tolerance, for any form of sexual misconduct and that we acknowledge the courage of those who have come forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810547">Those are not my words. That is the sentiment of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and he has made that very clear not only to members of the Canadian Forces, but all Canadians. That is the reality. We have invested money, we have a process system that will ultimately see some tangible results, but that is not good enough for the Conservatives. They say he should have done more. It is really ironic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810548"> I asked the Bloc and the NDP, who say they will support this motion, about the behaviour of the leader of the Conservative Party. That is not a problem for them. I do not hear them saying anything about that. I asked them if they were going to give him a pass and they completely avoided the question. Like the buy-in on this Conservative motion, they want to focus on the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810549">What did happen? Back in July 2015, allegations were first raised under the Conservative government. What is truly amazing is that the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> was one of the individuals who was made aware of the rumours of misconduct. How many questions did he ask on the floor of the House in regard to that? When did he start asking questions? It would be an interesting question for the leader of the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810550">It was serious enough that the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> asked his staff back then to notify the then prime minister's chief of staff, who then took it to the Privy Council Office for a review. In other words, they took the very same steps our <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has taken. The primary difference might be that our minister did it a whole lot quicker than what the current leader of the official opposition did. What a double standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810551">Are the NDP, the Bloc, the unholy alliance, saying that no harassment of this degree took place over the last 10 years, that this is relatively recent and that our party is ultimately responsible? There is an institutional issue that needs to be dealt with, and this government, in particular the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, are committed to dealing with that issue, unlike Stephen Harper and the current <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> who both had a chance to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810552">For the members at the standing committee, in particular those from the opposition parties, where was their interest in this issue pre-2015? Did they attempt to study the issue? Often what happens is issues come up and committees will respond to them, departments will respond to them. That is typically what would give the committee the mandate to look into things and to investigate them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810553">I do not think members are naive. I believe we all understood there was a very serious issue, just like I know there are very serious issues with systemic racism in other institutions, whether it is with the RCMP or the Canadian forces. These issues exist. If the standing committee had wanted to study the issue in a truly non-partisan way, I am sure there would have been far greater progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810554">Earlier today, when we had the tabling of reports from committees, we even heard some members comment on how effective committees could be when their members worked together. With the official opposition, policy does not matter. It is how its members can tear down the government and the people who make up the Government of Canada. That is their primary objective, and today the focus is on the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810555">I asked a question about the character of the individual. I referred to this quote earlier, a wonderful quote by Brigadier-General David Fraser, who was in charge of NATO's regional command south in Afghanistan back in 2006.

Literally tens of thousands of people look up to him, and the Conservative Party wants to take him down. They are saying that it is not personal. What garbage. The NDP and the Bloc might be fooled into believing that, but I am not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810559"> Many thousands of people who know the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> do not believe it either. They understand what is taking place today. Shame on the combined unholy alliance of the opposition parties that have made the determination to try to censor a hero, a Minister of National Defence who has brought not only legislation before the House but budgetary measures to increase the funds for the armed forces, which Stephen Harper could not and did not do. I would compare the current minister of defence to Jason Kenney any day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810560">Do members of the unholy alliance of opposition parties believe there should be no consequences for the current <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>? Had he acted based on the standards that the opposition parties are talking about today, General Vance would never have been in the position in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810561">At the end of the day, the opposition members had a choice. They could continue their character assassination line, something which they started back in 2015, as the records will show, going after one minister after another with a special focus on some ministers over others. It is not the first time they have called for a minister to resign. On the other hand, they could have actually talked about an issue. After all, we are in a third wave of the pandemic. Canadians are dying because of the COVID pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810562">Yesterday, a bogus question of privilege was raised by a member who stopped just before Private Members' Business. He still has not come back to finish it. That shows just how important the question of privilege was. I stood and said that it would be a good opposition day motion, because it was on policy. The member wanted to talk about issues affecting the pandemic, Canadians, taxation policies and so forth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810563">The problem is that the opposition wants to shy away from policy. It does not want that. The official opposition wants to assassinate the character of those within cabinet and try to give a false impression. That is really unfortunate. No matter how hard that focus is, whether it is on the floor of the House or in our standing committees, this is a government that will continue to be focused on the pandemic and on ensuring Canada is in a good position to recover, no matter what sort of approach the unholy alliance of opposition parties chooses to take.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810598">Normally when I rise in the House, I am very pleased to put words on the record about all the issues we talk about here, but today I rise with extreme frustration and disappointment concerning the sexual misconduct in the Canadian military, the lack of results from the Liberal government and the failure of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> to take this issue seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810599">The Conservative motion on the table today rightfully calls for the resignation of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> because of his record on this issue, and because of the men and women in our Canadian Armed Forces who have been sexually exploited and who he has let down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810600">I listened intently to the minister's speech today in response to our motion. I was waiting and hoping that he would express regret for his record on failing to address sexual misconduct in the military, but he did not. There was no personal acknowledgement that he had thus far failed to send a clear message to the most powerful men in our military, who report to him, that this behaviour will not be tolerated and that this culture is no longer acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810601">The minister has been in charge of our military for over six years, yet in that time, and especially in the last five months, we have seen eight senior ranking military officials resign in disgrace over allegations of sexual misconduct under his watch. In the five months since the scandal concerning General Vance broke, who at the time was the head of our military, it has only gotten worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810602">Most recently, Canadians learned that the man who has authority over the investigation of sexual misconduct went golfing with the man accused of that misconduct. After five months of headlines, they thought it would be okay to go golfing together, which is the clearest violation of conflict of interest that I have ever heard of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810603">When I saw that headline the other day about the golfing scandal, it truly sickened me to know how little has really changed after the last five months of repeated headlines and conversations about this scandal. I cannot imagine how that headline was received by the men and women in the military who have been raped, abused and mistreated by their superiors, and for them to know that nothing has changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810604">This was after the minister answered dozens and dozens of questions in the House, in committee and from reporters on this issue since it broke in February. Time and time again, he has said that he is essentially proud of his progress on this issue, with that disclaimer of, “Oh, there's much more work to do, but don't worry, we'll get to it”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810605">Well, the fact that the man in charge of the investigation thought it would be acceptable to go golfing with his buddy, the man accused of the misconduct, is all the information I need to know about how this Liberal minister clearly failed to pass on the message he has so proudly shared in the House of Commons with members from all parties. He is happy to say the words to reporters, to the opposition and to his voters, but he is, apparently, incapable with following through, being a leader and laying down the law. He is the head of our military. The buck stops with the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of Defence</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810606">When it comes to this culture of old boys' club men protecting each other from accountability for demeaning and disrespecting women in our military, the minister has demonstrated that he does not have the ability to follow through on his words. Otherwise, the golfing scandal would have never happened. That is why we are asking for his resignation today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810607">I want to speak for a moment about what it is like for the thousands of women in uniform who have served our country, and the millions more women in Canada who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. I say women, but of course, we know that men also experience this. In fact, 30% of the sexual misconduct complaints in our military are from men, so it is important that we do not forget them. However, I can only speak from a female perspective, and that is what I will be doing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810608">I will use the example of the email that General Vance sent to his junior officer, whom he far outranked, because not only does it show what he thinks is acceptable behaviour, but it speaks perfectly to the broader issue of the power imbalances in the workplace when sexual relations are brought into it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810609">A junior ranking military official met General Vance at a function, and he offered her mentorship and career advice if she ever needed it. It is pretty exciting as a young, aspiring career woman to get an offer of mentorship by a superior, especially an older man, which is very valuable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810610">We live in a man's world, so we cannot put a price on that career advice, and I can imagine she was quite excited for the opportunity. However, when she emailed him for that career advice, he concluded his reply with, “Or...we could throw caution to the wind and escape to a clothing optional island in the Caribbean...I hear the beer is good there... Cheers, JV” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810611">Now, I do not know this woman, but I do know how she must have felt reading that email. She was probably excited to see the email pop up in her inbox, to see what he was going to say, but she opened it only to see that he was propositioning her for sex. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810612">Make no mistake, this happens all the time, but when it happens, when one gets a message like that, whether it is in person, a text, an email or a phone call, a woman instantly gets a pit in her stomach. It is like a vice grip. Her heart starts beating. She may start to sweat. She is sickened with anxiety and dread because she knows in that instant that everything has changed for her, but not for him. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810613">I am not sure whether his comment was flippant or deliberate, and I am not sure which one is worse, but with it General Vance changed the entire dynamic of that relationship. Why is that? These types of relations are against the rules in the military, which he would have well known. If these were unwanted advances, which clearly they were, now the junior member had to deal with an ordeal that she did not ask for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810614">Now it is a situation that she is going to stress over. She is going to lose sleep over it and try to navigate it without damaging her career. This woman had to figure out how to push back and say she was not interested without damaging his ego. All women in this chamber will know that when a man makes advances they do not want there is that nervous laughter: “Ha, ha, so funny. Get your hand off me”. I think all the women in this chamber have probably experienced that at some point or another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810615">Every woman I know certainly has had to deal with this at some point in her career, and it is particularly insidious when it is at the workplace. Perhaps there is an aggressive drunk at a bar. We know the feeling of dread and of having to try our best to let these men down gently so we do not hurt their egos. Make no mistake, I have met thousands of men who are amazing allies to women, but I have come across those insidious men in my career and in my life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810616">A woman knows that if she does not tread carefully, verbal abuse can ensue or perhaps violence. It can affect her career if her name comes up for a promotion, for example, or for a new posting or new opportunity, and the old boys are talking about who they are going to pick for that promotion or that new posting. She knows that if she hurts a man's ego with her response, it might affect the reference he would give her when her name comes up. Let us be real here. That is what is going on. That is what women have to deal with when unwanted sexual advances come their way from male superiors in the workplace, and this happens all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810617">It is particularly insidious at work because it affects a woman's career. Everything that she put work into is at stake in that ridiculous moment when someone thoughtlessly says something to her. General Vance did that to this servicewoman. He might not have given it a second thought, but if that is the case, that is how detached from reality he really is. That is how drunk on power he and his fellow high-ranking military officers really are. They have no idea what it is like for the women they do these things to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810618">We know this kind of behaviour is just the tip of the iceberg. It is symbolic of a greater problem. Women have been sexually abused, raped and harassed day in and day out in our military, all while trying to do their jobs, keep their heads down and advance their careers like everybody else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810619">There are land mines like this everywhere for women as they rise up the ranks in their careers. I know it. I have lived it, just like millions of other women. I am not unique, but it is real and it happens every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810620">What is most disappointing is that the Liberal government was elected twice on its feminist promises and credentials, yet here we are six years later with no feminist change seen in our military. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> has spoken at length about this, yet nothing has happened. The scandals just keep rolling out. Every day there is a new headline. These men thought that going golfing during an ongoing sexual misconduct investigation was somehow acceptable just a few days ago. That is the minister's record on this issue. That is why we are calling for him to resign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810621">Before I conclude, I have two quick things to say. I want to seriously thank the Conservative members on the defence committee for their dedication and their tireless effort. I am very proud to serve alongside them. They have been tireless in their pursuit of justice for the women and men who have been mistreated in our military. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810622">To the men and women in our military who have suffered through this hell, and I do not choose that word lightly, I say we are with them. We have their backs and we will not stop until there is a reckoning in our Canadian military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810623">I will conclude with a message to women Liberal MPs in the House. I know that they are all proud feminists, but now is the time to walk the talk. If they are going to go door to door in the next election and tout their feminist credentials, they have to stand up for women when it counts. It counts today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810624">The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has failed the women in our military. He has failed to stand up for them. He has failed to fulfill his duty and hold these powerful men accountable. He has failed to send the message that it is not okay to go golfing with the accused when an investigation is going on. There is no way around it. There is no other way they can try to spin it. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810625">I know that in their hearts the Liberal members, particularly the women, know what I am saying is correct. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> might be a nice guy, but that is not the point. He clearly cannot fulfill his duty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810626">In conclusion, the current <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has proved he cannot defend women who have been sexually harassed, raped and abused. The women in our military only need seven Liberal MPs to abstain or, better yet, vote for his resignation. He could still be an MP, but he should not have control over changing the culture in our military after he has let us down as women so profoundly. I would ask seven Liberal MPs to please consider this and do the right thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810643">Madam Speaker, it is hard to follow a member like the member for <Affiliation DbId="252986" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation>. She basically made the entire case for this motion. I am not going to repeat what she said because she passionately explained to Canadians and her constituents the exact matter at hand: the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s dereliction of duty and his failure to take command of the situation, to own responsibility for it and to do the right thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810644">This is a motion that calls for the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s censure. The House of Commons is unsatisfied with the quality of his work. It is not enough to simply keep repeating that he is doing something. I have heard Liberal MPs say this repeatedly. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> made the best possible case that could be made in the House, and it is still not enough. I hear from constituents and read in the papers that he is just not doing enough. He has failed. He has not done the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810645">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> refuses to relieve him of his responsibilities, so we are at a point where we have to censure a member. Earlier today the member for <Affiliation DbId="252522" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation> mentioned that 20 years had passed since a member had been censured in the House in this manner for the performance of their duties and responsibilities to Canadians. It has been a very long time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810646">The issues are the sexual harassment and misconduct allegations in the military, the treatment of Vice-Admiral Norman and the continuing cover-up of what is going on. They include misleading Canadians on the withdrawal of fighter jets in the fight against ISIS. They go on and on. The Canadian Forces are in disarray. The men and women in uniform do not have a leader who is willing to take command. At last count, eight or nine senior officers in the military had either resigned, been fired or been relieved of command duties. That is huge. We have no commander-in-chief and there is no Governor General, either. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is supposed to be the one responsible at the moment, and I do not think there is any faith in his ability to deliver on everything that he is supposed to right now, which is why Conservatives are asking for a vote of censure on him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810647">“The first rule of politics: never believe anything until it's been officially denied.” That is a Sir Humphrey Appleby quote. There will be a Yiddish proverb at some point. I will think of one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810648">The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has denied knowing anything, but then there were internal access to information requests that came back saying the minister knew. There was a long chain of information from the Privy Council of what it knew, when it knew it and when it was informed these were #MeToo sexual harassment allegations. Now we have that information and it is unbelievable that we are here, nearing the end of June and still debating who is responsible for the failure to address these systemic problems in the senior ranks of the Canadian Armed Forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810649">Brigadier-General Gordon O'Connor served the House very honourably. He was the minister of national defence over a decade ago. He used to say that sexual harassment and misconduct issues in the military were issues of command. There is a command responsibility for senior officers to look after those in the lower ranks, and to make sure they are treated correctly by their commanding officers. Commanding officers who cannot keep control of their troops have failed in their duties of command, in just the way the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has failed in his responsibilities of command.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810650">The reason I know Gordon O'Connor, a former brigadier-general, former “zipperhead” or tank commander and former minister of national defence in the House, is because I was a junior exempt staffer in his employ. I know exactly what he expected of senior officers in his ranks. That is well over a decade ago now, so I am dating myself. As my staff always remind me, there is a generational divide between them and me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810651">The Yiddish proverb I am thinking of is, “Words should be weighed, not counted.” The motion has weighty words in it. Conservatives are asking for censure of a <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> for his performance and failure in the conduct of his duties. He has a responsibility to the men and women in the armed forces to ensure, first, that their commanding officers do not mistreat them, and second, that he follows through on investigations to make sure they are safe from their own members in their workplace. They expect the enemy on the battlefield to be shooting at them, trying to end their lives and kill them. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6810652">What they expect in return is that we have their backs, that the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has their backs and that when he sends them into harm's way, he sends them with commanding officers who are able to ensure their personal safety from their own. That is a minimum requirement we should expect from the minister and the senior ranks of the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810653">I know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252550" Type="2">Edmonton West</Affiliation> will appreciate that I have gone through the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s departmental plans that he signed off on. After question period I will refer to the departmental plans, but they show that the minister, who signs off on these documents every time they are submitted with the estimates that we have to vote on, and the military have not been taking it seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810654"> I read here, “To be determined by March 31, 2021”, and then it defers it until 2022 and future years. There are no targets in place. There is no plan in place in their own departmental plans. They have not said anything in about here fixing actual goals for dealing with the problem. They are literally kicking it down the road. They are waiting for future years to take care of this. There is talk publicly, but as for the actual plans for the civil service and what it is supposed to be doing, there is nothing there. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810657">Madam Speaker, Canadians know that I have fought hard for them in Parliament over the past several months when other parties have failed to do so. Too many times, we heard nothing but silence in Parliament over urgent issues, such as the detainment of Canadians at airports; research into promising COVID treatments like Ivermectin, which has been utilized in other jurisdictions but not Canada; the unconstitutional push for vaccine passports with no debate in the House of Commons; the use of endless lockdowns across Canada, despite the negative impact on our economy and youth mental health; the rights of workers against forced vaccinations in the workplace and, of course, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s famous double standard on the constitutional rights of Canadians to protest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810658">I have always stood up for Canadians on these issues, just like today when I hosted a panel of Canadian doctors and professors, who are now facing extreme censorship across our nation due to their whistle-blowing on Canada's handling of COVID-19.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810660">Madam Speaker, Canada is currently facing an entirely avoidable crisis. Every year, we waste approximately 13 million tonnes of food, one of the highest per capita levels in the world. This wasted food creates some 56.5 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions, uses 1.5 billion cubic metres of fresh water, uses land three times the size of PEI and could feed 24 million people if it were recouped. This massive waste is only made worse by the fact that four million Canadians still struggle to access healthy food. All along the supply chain, from farm to fork, are inefficiencies that end up leading to more than half of all food produced in Canada being wasted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810661">It is time for the federal government to take a serious look at the avoidable crisis of food waste and develop a comprehensive federal strategy to address it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810671">Madam Speaker, this afternoon in Montreal, people gathered at the urging of Amnesty International to once again demand the release of Raïf Badawi. I say “once again” because Mr. Badawi has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for nine years now, without having committed a single crime. For nine years now, his wife Ensaf and his three children have been hoping that the Canadian government would take action to reunite their family, but nothing is being done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810672">We actually thought that the process would speed up in January, when the House unanimously demanded that the federal government grant Raïf Badawi Canadian citizenship. However, the <Affiliation DbId="253396" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation> has done nothing. If this continues, Mr. Badawi will serve his entire unjust sentence before Ottawa takes the slightest measure to facilitate his release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810673">Enough is enough. There are four days left in the session. The House has been asking the minister to grant Raïf Badawi citizenship for five months. His wife and family have been waiting for him for nine years. The minister must do his job.</ParaText>

Our communities are better and stronger places to live because of their tenacity and commitment to weathering this storm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810693"> That said, on behalf of Manitoba business owners, I want to express their disappointment and frustration over how the Liberal government continues to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. Many businesses, especially in the catering, hospitality, travel and tourism sectors, remain shuttered because of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810694"> Just today, one of my constituents said, “All I ask of the government is to quit making us beg to open.” They made the sacrifices and took on mountains of debt to get through this crisis. However, the Liberal government’s slow reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of forward planning and late rollout of vaccines and rapid testing are directly responsible for the delayed reopening of our economy and the ongoing suffering of small businesses.</ParaText>

That is on the Liberals.</ParaText>

Young families cannot afford to buy a home. People are losing their jobs. Taxation, red tape and restrictions are stifling and shuttering businesses across the country. Success is no longer determined by hard work. It is something only well-connected Liberals and the wealthy can achieve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810705">With the entire auto sector having a once-in-a-generation investment cycle, which will impact us for many decades as vehicles will be produced, Canada's lack of a national auto policy is leaving workers behind, and our country is at risk of losing the industry that built our middle class. We cannot and should not depend solely on the impressive union contract negotiations that Unifor has achieved to secure any new investment. For the past 19 years, as a member of the House, I have been advocating for a national auto strategy and warning about what would happen without one. While other countries of the world have implemented theirs, our vehicle production has continued to decline year after year.</ParaText>

By “colleagues”, I mean all MPs, past and present, and every Bloc Québécois staffer over the years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810907">Mr. Gagnon chose to step down a little sooner than we might have liked. It was only just in 2019 that we made a vigorous comeback. All of us—the Bloc Québécois, the House of Commons, Parliament, all members and every unit of the House of Commons administration—are losing an exceptional man, a man who made his mark and whose influence will not soon be forgotten in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810908">Mr. Gagnon is the Gagnon of Bosc and Gagnon's famous <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>. It is a monumental work, a manual detailing the procedure and practice of the House of Commons, and he was its co-author. It took seven years of rigorous, serious work by a rigorous, serious man.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810909">It is also true that, throughout his career, which began in 1998, he has had exceptional experiences. He worked closely with Audrey O'Brien, the first ever female clerk of the House of Commons. He also worked closely with the youngest member of Parliament to become Speaker of the House, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252794" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, who was 32 when he was appointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810910">Mr. Gagnon saw and supported the arrival of several members from parties not recognized by the House of Commons: the Greens in 2011 and the Bloc Québécois between 2011 and 2019. He saw majority and minority governments and, in every situation, he was quick on his feet and skilfully dealt with the pressure from the various parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810911">Mr. Gagnon is well liked by all political parties, members and colleagues, for a number of reasons. The first, and most important, is that he has a keen understanding of the political issues faced by MPs. We feel understood; he understands us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810912">He has a profound respect for the role of MPs. All members, be they government members, opposition members, members of an unrecognized party or independents, receive the same robust and respectful support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810913">Generous in his explanations and teachings, he wants members to understand procedure. He knows how to transmit his passion. I must also point out Mr. Gagnon's contribution to promoting the French language in the world of parliamentary procedure, since he has been vice-president of the Association des secrétaires généraux des parlements francophones since 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810914">Mr. Gagnon is known to be a unifier and a positive leader. The Bloc Québécois has a great affection for him and greatly admires his career. I want to say that he also has the perfect personality for the position. His smile, his good humour, his sense of humour, his ability to listen, his generosity and his respect for members are, in my opinion, human qualities that every clerk should have. Let us be frank, he has them all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810915">We are sad to see him go. We are losing a giant, an exceptional man, and we know that our sadness is shared by his colleagues and by every member of the House. We all know that he will be leaving behind a great void.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810916">In conclusion, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I would like to extend my most heartfelt thanks to deputy clerk, procedure, André Gagnon for his excellent work, his contribution and his dedication to the public service. We owe him much and wish him a wonderful retirement.</ParaText>

He sends his regards to Mr. Gagnon on his retirement.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6810921">Clerk since the 1990s and deputy clerk of procedure since 2014, André Gagnon has left his mark in the House of Commons. Everyone will agree that his work ethic and his respect for the institution are exemplary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810922">Among the New Democrats, a number of qualifiers have been used to describe him, including “professional”, “courteous”, “neutral” and “skilled”. He has a great sense of humour, even in the weirdest situations, like when he inversed voting results on October 21, 2020.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6810923">André has a solid understanding of procedure from having studied and analyzed it so thoroughly. Perhaps that is why his hair seems to get darker with time, rather than turning grey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810924">He has excellent general knowledge, too. He knows all the classics in music, from Zabé to Fugain, as well as contemporary music.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810925">André knows that nobody is irreplaceable. He knows that others will follow in his footsteps with the same passion for procedure and the same work ethic, and that they will take up their duties with as much respect for members, for the rules and for this institution, the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810926">Nevertheless, his departure is still a great loss for the House. André has been one of the greatest clerks the House has ever known. I thank him for his professionalism, his wise counsel and his sense of humour. Thank you for everything, André, and happy retirement.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6810927">On behalf of the NDP caucus, I thank André very much for sharing his knowledge and wisdom throughout the years. We wish him the best in his future plans.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6810946">Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the extra 45 seconds. It is much appreciated. I was worried I would not have time to go through the departmental plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810947">Where I left off before question period was that I wanted to get into the departmental plans. This is where the rubber hits the pavement. This is where we see the priorities of the minister. Is he actually taking seriously the sexual misconduct allegations, stories, and individual cases of men and women who have been abused by others in the military? What I discovered is that the government is not taking it seriously, and the minister is not taking it seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810948">Let us go back to the 2018-19 departmental plan. It has “Annual # of reported incidents of Harmful and Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour in the Defence Team” as one category of priorities, and then under “Target”, it says “To be determined by 31 March 2021”. It has no available indicators of where they were at. Under the field “Number and type of actions taken in response to reported Harmful and Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour incidents by the Defence Team”, it says “To be determined by 31 March 2021”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810949">I will move on to the following years, 2019-20. Under “Annual number of reported incidents of Harmful and Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour in the Defence Team”, it says “To be determined by 31 March 2021”. Again, there are no indicators anywhere, no reported numbers anywhere. Under “Number and type of actions taken in response to reported Harmful and Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour incidents by the Defence Team”, it says “To be determined by 31 March 2021”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810950">I will move on to the next departmental plan, 2020-21. Under “% of the Canadian Armed Forces...who self-identify as victims of harassment”, the target is “Less than 11.9%”. The minister signed off on every single departmental plan. Less than 12% is one in eight members of the Canadian Armed Forces to suffer being inappropriately harassed in the workplace. The actual results for 2018-19 were 17.7%. This is the first time there are actual numbers being presented here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810951">Now, in the departmental plan for 2021-22, the fields actually change, which is pretty typical of the government. We have “Annual number of reported incidents of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces”. Members would think that by now the department would have it figured out, but no, it says “To be determined by 31 March 2022”. There are two wonderful little asterisks, and they leave it for well into the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810952">If the minister was actually serious, if the words he says in this chamber and outside in nice statements actually meant anything to him, he would have followed through in the departmental plans that he signs off on and ensured that there was follow-up and actual, real targets put forward. This is why the House has come to the moment now of censuring the minister, because he has shown a dereliction of his duties, an irresponsibility of command and, overall, he has led the Canadian Forces into disarray. The situation we find ourselves in is entirely of his own doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810953">As was mentioned during question period, this is a minister who served in his post the longest of any member of cabinet. He owns the entire last six years; they are entirely his responsibility. We are making a judgment call here, as members of Parliament, to hold him personally accountable for his own performance, which, as we can see in the departmental plans, does not meet the standards of what a minister should be doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810954">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="252986" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation> said before me, the minister has shown an extreme dereliction of duty and of his own responsibilities as the top member responsible. He is the political head of the department, the political head of the Canadian Armed Forces. It falls to him at the end of the day, and he has fallen far short. We must vote to censure the minister on this matter. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810955">Mr. Speaker, the departmental plans, as described on the government's website, “describe departmental priorities”. These are priorities presented in the House, signed by the minister himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810956">Now, in the departmental plan for this year, there are two notable things. My colleague mentioned several, but there is also “Number of Canadian Armed Forces members who have attended a training session related to sexual misconduct (Operation HONOUR)”. It says the department will set a goal, not this year, but a year from now. So, there is no goal set for this year. This has been an issue for three years, and the department cannot even set a goal until next year. The other one is “Number and type of actions taken in response to reported sexual misconduct incidents by the Defence Team”. What is the department's goal? There is not any this year, but it will set a goal next year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810957">What does my colleague think when the minister stands and states again and again that this is a priority? Ending this misconduct is a priority, and yet the minister's own form that he signed and presented to the House states that the department will not even look at it this year and maybe a goal will be set next year. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810959"> He is right. If this was a priority and it was absolutely serious, then in these plans that the minister signed off on he would have given absolute direction to the department, set the target, benchmarked himself against the goal he was trying to reach, and proven to the rest of us that he actually does take this seriously. </ParaText>

They take responsibility, they move forward and they change things, and the minister has not done that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810972">I rise today to talk about our government's commitment to supporting the Canadian Armed Forces and the crucial role it plays in keeping Canadians safe, and supporting stability and security around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810973">The previous Conservative government did everything it could to take Canada out of global affairs. Its philosophy is clear: It believes the world needs less Canada. Our Liberal government believes the opposite. We know the world needs more Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810974"> When we were elected in 2015, our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was crystal clear to our friends, allies and partners around the world. After 10 years of disinterest in foreign policy and disengagement under the previous government, Canada was back, multilateralism was back, diplomacy was back and engagement was back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810975">Around the globe, including at the recent NATO and G7 summits, Canada's leadership and contributions to global security are saluted by our partners and friends. Canada's international reputation as a force for good is in large part thanks to the sacrifices and hard work of the women and men of our Canadian Armed Forces. Since 2015, the capabilities of the Canadian Armed Forces have been on full display in several expeditionary operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810976">In the Middle East, the Canadian Armed Forces have worked to bring peace and stability on a number of operations in recent years. On Operation Artemis, they worked to counter terrorism and disrupt illicit drug trafficking in the maritime domain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810977">While deployed, the HMCS <I>Calgary</I> shattered two of the maritime forces combined all-time records for the largest heroin seizure of three metric tonnes and the most seizures by any ship on a single deployment, with 17 seizures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810978">Working with traditional and non-traditional partners under Combined Task Force 150, the Canadian Armed Forces have increased security in the Red Sea, the gulfs of Aden and Oman, and the Indian Ocean. What is more is that Canada has led the CTF 155 times since 2008. This included our most current command of the task force when it had considerable success in interdicting narcotics that help fund terrorist activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810979">Canadian Armed Forces members also contributed to Operation Calumet, Canada's support to the Multinational Force and Observers' independent peacekeeping operation in the Sinai Peninsula, in an area many Canadians know well thanks to the engagement and continued legacy of former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810980">Canadians may be most familiar with the work our Canadian Armed Forces have done as part of Operation Impact, which includes its contributions to NATO's capacity-building mission, NATO Mission Iraq. On that mission, the Canadian Armed Forces have worked to build the military capabilities of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, and set the conditions for their long-term success. Here too Canada assumed a leadership role for NATO Mission Iraq between 2018 and 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810981">As a founding member of NATO under Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, our commitment to NATO is strong and ironclad, unlike the Conservatives, who cut NATO contributions by $100 million and allowed military spending to reach an all-time low, dropping below 1% of GDP in 2013. Of course, these ideological cuts, which ignored the needs of our military, were aimed squarely at undermining Canada's history of multilateral engagement, all in a failed Conservative attempt to balance the budget on the backs of our Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810982">Thankfully, our government has returned Canada to its proud tradition of engagement. Just this past March, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Impact until March 2022, so Canada's important work on NATO Mission Iraq will continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810983">As members of the House are aware, eastern Europe has suffered significant instability in the past several years. Here too the Canadian Armed Forces have contributed significantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810984"> On Operation Reassurance, it has contributed to NATO's assurance and deterrence measures to reinforce NATO's collective defence. In recent years, there have been a combined total of up to 850 Canadian Armed Forces members deployed on the operation, making it Canada's largest current international military operation. Canada has assumed several leadership roles, as the framework nation of an enhanced force present in Latvia or by regularly leading standing NATO maritime groups.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6810985">In Ukraine, on Operation Unifier, the Canadian Armed Forces support the country's security forces. They have assisted with training and capacity building, while co-operating with the U.S. and other allies to ensure Ukraine's sovereignty, security and stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810986">Closer to home, members of our armed forces have delivered significant successes as part of Operation Caribbe, where they have participated in the U.S.-led enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean. They have worked to suppress drug trafficking in international waters where they have seized dozens of tonnes of cocaine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810987">While we are proud of what the Canadian Armed Forces accomplishes around the world, there is perhaps no more important role they have fulfilled than assisting Canadians in their times of need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810988"> In the past several years, the Canadian Armed Forces have been called upon, on numerous occasions, to do so as part of domestic operations. The Canadian Armed Forces are called upon to assist in search and rescue operations, natural disasters and any other emergency where only their expertise can adequately support Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810989"> Search and rescue crews are on standby 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They cover over 18 million square kilometres of land and sea and launch hundreds of times each year to respond to search and rescue emergencies. Since 2015, CF SAR techs have launched more than 4,200 times to save Canadian lives. Highly trained CAF members also stand ready to respond to natural disaster wherever and whenever required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810990">Over the past few years, the role of the Canadian Armed Forces in domestic disaster response has increased significantly. That is because climate change has resulted in more extreme weather, which, in turn, has produced more severe storms and natural disasters. While the Conservatives continue to deny that climate change is real, our government is engaged directly with vulnerable communities across Canada and our Canadian Armed Forces are working with Canadians to provide relief from the very real impacts of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810991">CAF support to Canadians during these events is called Operation Lentus, and I think we can all agree that Canadians are fortunate to have such a dedicated and skilled military to support them when their need arises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810992"> The winter before last, CAF deployed to Newfoundland and Labrador after major snowstorms led to emergencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810993"> In 2019, the CAF supported Nova Scotia with its response in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, and Ontario with the evacuation of first nations communities when they were at risk of smoke from forest fires in Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810994"> When wildfires ravaged parts of British Columbia and Manitoba in 2018, again, the armed forces were there to bring aid to remote communities and help prevent the spread or reignition of fires. That year, Canadian Armed Forces also assisted provincial partners in their responses to four other natural disasters across Canada, including floods, forest fires and winter storms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810995"> In total, the Canadian Armed Forces have deployed in support of Operation Lentus 18 times since 2015, and remain prepared to do so again whenever necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810996">The CAF efforts that will stick out most prominently in the minds of Canadians are likely those related to the global COVID pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810997">In February 2020, Canadian Armed Forces members helped bring people home in the face of the growing threat of coronavirus, repatriating Canadians from around the world. As part of Operation Globe, they helped return 870 people to Canada to quarantine safely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810998">By April, thousands of CAF members were assigned to Operation Laser, the mission to support the government's response to COVID-19. Through the operation, the CAF have assisted the federal, provincial and territorial governments through 60 requests for assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6810999"> During the first wave of COVID, the number of CAF members poised to assist all over the country peaked at more than 9,000 troops. Among them were approximately 1,700 personnel who worked tirelessly to help manage COVID outbreaks and protect vulnerable Canadians in 54 long-term care facilities, 47 in Quebec and seven in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811000">I wish to thank the Canadian Armed Forces members who came to my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge and who assisted the residents at the long-term care facility at Woodbridge Vista. We are forever thankful and grateful for their service, not only there but across the country. They do it day in and day out, very quietly and with such professionalism and a spirit that truly reflects the best of our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811018">The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> is one of the most honourable individuals I have ever met. He has served this country, both in uniform and in the House. He has broken down barriers as the first Sikh commander of a regiment, and I have personally seen his commitment to inclusion and equality as an ally. The aspersions that we are hearing today against him in the House are based on half-truths and blatant partisanship. The Minister of National Defence deserves our thanks and our respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811019">Today in my remarks, I would like to focus on the achievements since 2015, under this minister's leadership, to build a modern, agile and inclusive Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811020">Since 2015, we have worked hard to provide defence team members with everything they need to succeed both here at home and around the world. We have significantly invested in important procurement projects for our brave women and men serving in the army, navy and air force. We have ensured that everything we do is carried out with an eye toward environmental sustainability, and we have made progress building a more inclusive, safe and welcoming environment for all members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811021">In each of these lines of effort, we are guided by a robust and comprehensive defence policy: “Strong, Secure, Engaged”. It is a policy that puts our people first. In fact, it is the very first chapter. It makes sure that we are accountable to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811022">However, at the same time, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and I recognize that we need to do more. It is clear that the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces are in need of significant institutional culture change. It is clear that there are those who have been harmed by the remnants of an outdated, exclusionary and toxic military culture.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811023">As the minister said earlier, we are dealing with issues such as inequality, racism, systemic discrimination, sexual misconduct and abuse of power. These challenges are undermining the capacity of the armed forces to keep Canadians safe. They are eroding trust in the institution and, more importantly, they are hurting the people who chose to serve our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811024">We are taking important steps to address all of these challenges as we continue with our other important work. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811026">When we launched the defence policy in 2017, our goal was to ensure that our people are at the heart of everything we do. We launched important new initiatives to support their health and well-being at all stages of their careers, and we committed to taking care of their loved ones as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811027">These programs have helped thousands of CAF members over the last four years, but at the same time, we know that we have to do more for them, because we know that investing in the well-being of those tasked with our protection is and should always be our top priority. We need to create a culture of dignity, respect and inclusion for all members at all levels, military or civilian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811028">We are committed to making comprehensive and lasting change and to addressing the systemic challenges that foster sexual misconduct and other inappropriate behaviours, including abuses of power, discrimination, biases and harmful stereotypes. That is why we asked former Supreme Court Justice Louise Arbour to undertake an external, independent, comprehensive review earlier this year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811029">Within the defence team, we have also created a new organization, Chief, Professional Conduct and Culture, under the leadership of Lieutenant-General Jennie Carignan. Its goal is ultimately to ensure that our actions, behaviours and institutional policies reflect the very best parts of our organization and Canadian society. That work is already under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811030">These efforts will build on our previous work done to modernize policies and processes and to promote true diversity and inclusion across the ranks. This includes integrating gender-based analysis plus in all of our policies, programs and services to remove barriers to inclusion and better support our personnel, and launching a new advisory panel on systemic racism and discrimination and the Anti-Racism Secretariat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811031">At the same time, we are also working hard to ensure that our military justice system is modern, fair and responsive to the needs of the Canadian Armed Forces. Through Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, we are implementing several significant changes to the military justice system, including incorporating a victims’ bill of rights to ensure that victims are supported and their voices are heard when interacting with the system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811032">Earlier this month, we tabled the third independent review by Justice Morris Fish. We accepted all 107 of his recommendations in principle and have already begun to implement 36 of them immediately to better serve our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811033"> Moreover, through budget 2021 we are committing $236 million to eliminate sexual misconduct and gender-based violence in the Canadian Armed Forces. This includes expanding the reach of the sexual misconduct response centre and providing online and in-person peer-to-peer support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811063">I am actually very torn to be speaking today. As most members in the House know, I spent 25 years in the military. I am actually speaking from a level of disappointment. I am not going to attack the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s record of service. In fact, I respect his record of service, both as a police officer in British Columbia and as a reservist with our Canadian Armed Forces. He has done three tours in Afghanistan. If I had to go back out on military operations in the future, I would trust him to be beside me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811064">There is a lot of talk here about politicians and civilian oversight, which nobody in the military would ever disagree with. We need that. We live in a democracy. However, and I hate to burst the bubble of some of my colleagues, the rank and file of the military do not really care too much about us in the House of Commons. They respect what we do, but they serve the country. They are not serving us: They serve all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811065">One serving member, as they followed some of this unfortunate situation with the sexual misconduct allegations and the state of the Department of National Defence and the military right now, said this just drives it home. They think they are political pawns for the government and that all decisions are being made based on keeping votes versus what is right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811066">For the rest of my speech, I am going to speak about the leadership and accountability of this minister, or lack thereof, since he became the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811067">In times of crisis, militaries rely on leaders to provide focus on the priorities that matter. They bring energy and determination and demand that standards are met. In a democracy, militaries are led by elected officials who must set the tone, give direction and follow up on that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811068"> None of this has happened, in the last three years in particular. Platitudes and evasion of accountability are the exact opposite of what is expected, and indeed what is demanded. Leaders must not only lead, they must be seen to lead. They seek and accept accountability in themselves and others. Canadians expect more. Canadian Armed Forces members need more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811069">The solution is not to express surprise and disgust, but to actually provide detailed, specific expectations, a path to meet those expectations and consequences when those expectations are not met. Accountability starts and stops with the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811070">I am going to focus on three of the sexual misconduct allegations currently ongoing within the Canadian Armed Forces. Let us talk about the former chief of the defence staff, General Vance, going back to 2018. I have discussed with the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> in the past my own frustration with and disappointment in the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for his interference in the independence of our judiciary and our prosecution system tied to the SNC-Lavalin affair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811071">In this case, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> says it is not up to politicians to interfere in an investigation. I would totally agree. However, as the CDS and the ombudsman report to the Minister of National Defence, he is at the top of their chain of command. He is clearly accountable for the performance of the Chief of the Defence Staff and he is the steward of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811072">When he was duly informed of a potential breach of Op Honour, an allegation of sexual misconduct by the former chief of the defence staff, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> failed to take appropriate action. He could have initiated an investigation, or at least ensured one was initiated by the appropriate authorities. However, once he was made aware of that breach, he actually became complicit in allowing the breach to continue by not taking that appropriate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811073">Had the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> still been a serving member within the Canadian Armed Forces, he could have been held accountable for failing to act. The minister knows this, and knows that it is the honourable thing to step down.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811074">Further, as a former police officer, he knows that initiating an investigation or demanding that one be conducted is not tantamount to interference. Interference with an investigation can only occur if one has been initiated. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, as a former police officer, cannot argue that he was unaware of that fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811075">Now I will talk about Admiral McDonald. During testimony at the defence committee, Lieutenant-Commander Trotter talked about how he attempted to report the allegations against Admiral McDonald. He was eventually placed in contact with the chief of staff to the department assistant. This is an office that supports the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, but reports directly to the deputy minister. These DND staff mishandled this complaint, initially suggesting that Lieutenant-Commander Trotter report the incident to the sexual misconduct response centre, which has no mandate to handle sexual misconduct complaints. Trotter was then referred to the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, but only after the military police liaison officer to the SMRC was brought into the discussion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811076">This incident further reinforces my point that even now, three years after the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was first made aware of allegations of shortfalls within the department, under his lack of leadership the department is still incapable of properly handling a sexual misconduct complaint when it involves higher ranks. This is clear evidence of sustained and systematic failure within the department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811077">More recently we heard about General Fortin. I am not going to get into the details because the only information I have is what has been made available to the public. However, what has been reported in the media suggests that DND and the Canadian Armed Forces are not even following their own policies involving General Fortin. He was directed to step aside and take leave when he was accused of historical allegations of misconduct. From the media reporting, General Fortin is now attempting to deal with this in court because the department and the military failed to follow the removal from command process that was established in the late 1990s and early 2000s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811078">This is a mess. Based on the public information available from General Fortin's lawyer, it has been suggested that senior Liberal leaders are directly engaged in these decisions affecting the employment of the Canadian Armed Forces senior leadership. Of the first two examples, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is refusing to take action on one under the auspices of not interfering, yet the Liberals are not following the proper processes on the other and are actually interfering in a potential sexual misconduct allegation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811079">I would like to conclude with some feedback and commentary that I have received from the rank and file and recently retired members of the Canadian Armed Forces: their opinions about the current government and the lack of leadership by the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. One said, “I had no intention of framing or hanging my certificate of service because it has the current Prime Minister's name on it. Now I think it might make a very good fire starter.” When I talk to victims and people I know who have testified at committee about sexual misconduct allegations, and I ask what they think about the Liberal filibustering going on at the defence committee, the word they use is “brutal”. A former senior military officer said, “This Minister of National Defence enjoys no confidence from any part of either the department or the Canadian Armed Forces due to his lack of leadership.” </ParaText>

I also want to thank him for not joining the apparent chorus and pile-on effect in attacking the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and his record.

              <ParaText id="6811082">Given the degree of experience my friend across the floor has, his background and service, it is not impossible to imagine a universe in which, if the Conservatives formed government, he would become the minister of national defence.

The <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was not the Minister of National Defence at the time of the previous incident. He was the Minister of Veterans Affairs and was not the one accountable or directly responsible. In fact, he took the appropriate action by reporting an allegation or rumour he heard to the appropriate authorities, which was then investigated by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service. Obviously, based on the information it made available, it maybe did not highlight the shortfalls with the previous chief of the defence staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811085">As for answering the member's hypothetical, if I had been the Minister of National Defence when the former ombudsman brought that allegation forward, I would not have hesitated to look at it and make a determination to get an investigation started, then I would have stayed out of it.

One woman a day in Quebec is a victim of domestic violence. All these women want somewhere to go for help, but they have nowhere to turn because of a lack of resources. I assume the situation is similar across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811087">According to the Regroupement québécois des centres d'aide et de lutte contre les agressions à caractère sexuel, only 5% of sex crimes are reported to the police. This means they are almost never reported. Some cases do go to court, but only three out of every 1,000 sexual assault complaints result in a conviction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811088">For years now, we have been witnessing a sad spectacle as the government, including the Prime Minister, his chief of staff and the Department of National Defence, have tried to cover up this sexual misconduct, which is documented.

              <ParaText id="6811091">Specifically within the Canadian Armed Forces, when the first report by Madame Deschamps came out I was still in uniform. I was shocked. In fact, I will even admit I almost did not believe it until I started talking to a number of my female colleagues who are still serving, and they started telling me stories. I got so disgusted and mad that I almost got mad at them, because I had obviously failed if they did not feel they could use me as a colleague or peer, as we were lieutenant-colonels at the time. They could not come forward and tell me what was going on regarding the behaviour of some general officers. That is on me. That is on every senior officer, male and female, within the Canadian Armed Forces who is allowing this to be perpetuated and not fixing it. Yes, independence is required. Everybody needs to step up.

              <ParaText id="6811093">Mr. Speaker, I wish that we did not have this motion before us today. This is not something that is great for Canada or for our armed forces, but at the same time it is necessary. I am a bit frustrated and a little angry to be speaking to this today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811094">The Canadian military forms an integral part of who I am, as an individual and as a Canadian, as is true for so many other Canadians. My father enlisted in the Korean War in the 1950s. He was 17 years old. His father would not sign his papers unless he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. He actually was in the process of signing up for the Princess Pats. This unit went on to Korea and fought in the battle of Kapyong, where we had many casualties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811095">This battle was really a key battle. The Princess Pats regiment was given a presidential citation for bravery for facing overwhelming odds against Korean, North Korean and Chinese troops as they were swarming over and invading South Korea at the time. The PPCLI was there to protect the retreat. They were the rearguard for South Korean and American forces and troops, putting their lives at stake, and there were deaths. As a matter of fact, it got so bad that they called on artillery to be fired upon their own positions because they were being overrun.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811096">This measure of bravery is what Canadians are known for, and they have been for over a century. Members can think of the First World War and Vimy Ridge. Canadian soldiers got the job done. There were thousands of casualties. They advanced in the face of fire and lay their lives down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811097">Over 100,000 Canadian troops, men and women, have laid down their lives for our country and for our freedoms, and we honour them. We honour their memory for what they have done, not just those who have lain down their lives, but all those who have served in the military and who are serving the military. We are proud of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811098">I can imagine being at the mess hall table or in the barracks and having these conversations. I am sure it is frustrating to hear about how many generals have had to resign. This is at the top, and the onus and leadership needs to be taken. We have actually seen a lack of leadership and a lack of accountability, and it is shameful. It is not right. It is not appropriate for our troops.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811099">We live in a critical time. I will talk more about that in a few moments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811100">My dad went on to serve for 36 years. We lived on bases. I was born in Germany, at 4 Wing in Baden Soellingen. It was West Germany at that time. The Berlin Wall was built when I was there. I am kind of aging myself. I know I look very young, but I was born at that time, in the 1960s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811101">My dad later told me that when I was born he wondered what type of world he was bringing his child into. He did not know, with nuclear bombs all over. I remember growing up later on, having air-raid sirens and preparing for the potentiality of a war, but the Canadian troops were there. They served in great strength and numbers. We were a very serious partner.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811102">We still are. We have great troops. They have been reduced over the years, but we have fantastic troops. One thing Canadian soldiers are noted for is their quality. They are great professional soldiers who do their job and are not trying to get glory. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811103">I talked to my father before he died and asked about stories he had not told me before. He started in the Air Force working on the ground crew putting munitions on aircraft, bombers and fighters. He was serving somewhere in Alberta at the time, and he said a Lancaster bomber landed and crashed into the hangar at the air base. It was fully loaded with bombs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811104">My father took no thought to his life, and he ran in with an extinguisher. He saved the airmen and put the fire out. He dragged out the pilot and did not make a big fuss about it. The pilot actually gave him $20. In those days that was quite a bit. He did not get a medal. He was not trying to get the glory, and that is what our soldiers are like. They are not necessarily trying to get the glory. They are there to do the job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811105">I want to pay my respects for what the men and women in uniform do day in and day out on land, sea and water serving our country. They deserve our applause. We applaud them. I think of various battles. I think of the First World War and Vimy Ridge. That had been assaulted numerous times by other troops, but the Canadians went in there and they took it over. They are soldiers known in the past, and now, for their valour, intelligence and commitment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811106">They were also the shock troops in 1918. Even in 1918, there was the risk of losing the war, and they were first in line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811107">My wife and I were at Juno Beach in 2017. While I was there I had the realization that, during the Second World War, Canadians had spilled their blood there. Hundreds of young soldiers. I ask members to imagine the sacrifice they made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811108">We have a strong peacekeeping tradition. I am from a family of six children raised, as I mentioned, in a military home in Chibougamau and Valcartier, Quebec, and Holberg, British Columbia, all these different bases. My first memories are of men in uniform and what they did, and of being proud to see my dad. I had the opportunity to also serve in the military, along with my brothers and sisters. I was proud to serve Canada, proud of the uniform and committed to the country. Honestly, I really feel that this is beyond politics. I know the Liberals will say this is politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811109"> This is also about our military and, in the face of great looming dangers with China and Russia, we cannot afford to have our military demoralized. We cannot afford this. The minister needs to do the right thing, even if he thinks he is innocent. Members have heard why we do not think he is so innocent, but that is not the point. The point is he needs to do the best thing for Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811130">I want to rise in the House today to speak about the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> in light of this very unfair opposition motion. I want to talk about who he is as a person and what he has done to serve Canada alongside so many others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811131"> Like so many of our friends and neighbours, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> came here as an immigrant. His mother came to our country in the hopes of building a better life for the minister and his sister. His parents left India because Canada was a place where they believed they could find the opportunity and that success. They left behind their family and their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811132">This story is likely familiar to you, Mr. Speaker, and to many others here in this House. It is a story of countless immigrant families from across this country. It is a story of sacrifice. Unlike the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>'s father was not a politician who served for almost two decades in the provincial Legislature. Instead, the Minister of National Defence stood beside his mother as a child in the blueberry, raspberry and strawberry fields, from Richmond to Abbotsford in British Columbia. He would wake up at 5:00 a.m. and join his mother and his sister, packed in a van with 30 other field labourers, for a long day of work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811133">It was in these fields where the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> realized that racism could be met with deadly consequences. As the minister said last year in an interview with CTV, one of his co-workers, a man in his 20s, did not show up to work one day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811136">In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and many others from the opposition still do not bother to pronounce the minister's name correctly. Maybe I will take a moment to say that the minister is “Sajjan,” which means honourable, respectable in Punjabi. For over six years, the Leader of the Opposition and the members opposite have had the opportunity to learn how to pronounce his name, and they have chosen not to. People who are visible minorities know what this is. These are microaggressions, and they are not mistakes. These microaggressions are racism, pure and simple.</ParaText>

I very much enjoyed listening to what she had to say. Unfortunately, her time ran out at the end. She was about to say something that never actually resurfaced in response to questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811162"> I would like to finish what the member was about to say, that the leader of the opposition voted against Motion No. 103, which dealt with Islamophobia in Canada. In fact, only two Conservatives, two brave Conservatives, voted in favour of that motion. I hate to put you on the spot, Mr. Speaker, but I believe you were one of them as was the member for <Affiliation DbId="252827" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>. Every other Conservative voted against that motion. We find ourselves in the situation we are in today even though members like the member for Mississauga—Erin Mills tried to sound the alarm a few years ago, and the Conservatives chose to ignore it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811163"> In any event, we are certainly not here to talk about that today. We are here to talk about the motion tabled by the official opposition, a motion that, in my opinion, is politically motivated, a motion whose only purpose is to try to defame a decorated veteran, a member of our cabinet, an individual who has served our country, who has done great things for our country and then has gone on to serve in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811164">This is not a surprise. This type of personal attack has been the ongoing theme of the Conservatives over the last six years. We have seen this day in and day out. Rather than talk about policy or how the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> can do something different or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should work on a different policy, it has always been “the Minister of Finance is this; the Prime Minister is that”. It has been personal attacks day in and day out. Unfortunately, what we are seeing here is nothing more than that. It is the same thing, once again, trying to attack the credibility of an individual, somebody who has served his country and continues to do so in another capacity now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811165">Why? In my opinion, this is all for political partisan gain, thinking that this might skew the current polling numbers. Rather than talk about the issues and encourage Canadians to vote for them because of their ideas, the ideas they can bring forward on behalf of Canadians, the Conservatives spend all their time focusing on how to make other people look bad, so they become the default choice, ruining careers in the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811166">Looking at the heart of this motion and in listening to members from other sides of the House today speak to it, a number of different issues come up. The main and most important issue is the culture that exists in our military. I really wish the motion would have focused on that. It is clear there is a ton of work to do with respect to that culture within the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811167">I do not know if this is the natural way that hierarchical organizations in the military are structured, coupled with the natural desire to keep things hush hush within the organization that has produced this culture, but from what we have seen, it is extremely toxic. Change needs to happen, so the people in the military, women and men, who are harassed are properly cared for, but, more important, that they feel comfortable to come forward to talk about it so they can get the care and protection they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811168">I could not agree more with a lot of the comments I heard earlier today about the vice chief of the defence staff playing golf with General Vance. The fact that happened is a huge issue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811169">The suggestion is that this issue lies at the feet of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. The Minister of National Defence does not approve the personal activities of individuals. Within organizations, it is expected that individuals can make good, sound judgments and decisions based on what is right and what is wrong, and this individual made a wrong decision. What happened? That individual is no longer in that position. It is entirely appropriate for us to accept the fact that the person is no longer in his position and it sends a clear message down the line that anymore behaviour like that will have the same result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811170">There has been a lot of discussion today about General Vance specifically, how he came to be in this role and how the current government had been propping him up, encouraging him, giving him raises and on and on. I am not going to go through the details again about how the complaint came forward, how it was handled, what was specifically said, what information was not obtained and why the investigation did not move forward. We have heard all about that on a number of occasions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811171">What about the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, who was the minister of veterans affairs previously, was made aware of allegations against General Vance? He did the right thing, exactly the same thing the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">national defence minister</Affiliation> did. He brought those allegations forward. They were brought to the PMO. Stephen Harper knew about the allegations. He was made aware of them through his chief of staff. Stephen Harper even met with General Vance. He sat down with him and asked if any of the rumours were true, to which the reply was no, that none of them were true. Then Stephen Harper still appointed him even when he knew about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811172">I find it extremely rich when the Conservatives stand in the House time and time again and point to the manner in which the current <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> handled this. We can compare this to what Stephen Harper did. Harper sat down with him, like two boys having a beer, and asked Vance if he had done anything. Hearing no, he appointed him. Why did Harper not start a process to find out more about it? Why did he not dig into it? Why did he not insist on some form of an investigation? Why did he not do that? All he did was meet with the person who was accused, that person said he did not do it, he took his word for it and appointed him. The hypocrisy of this is that they literally went through almost the exact process and then appointed the individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811173">The motion today, similar to yesterday's motion, is extremely unfortunate. We voted on the motion today to bring a public servant before the bar of the House. The New Democrats voted in favour of that. The champions of the public service, who will have a front-row seat when it happens on Monday, voted in favour of it. They can explain to the public service why they thought it was the right thing to do, why it was the right course of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811174">It is shameful that we are having this discussion today, as was the discussion on the motion yesterday. I certainly will not be supporting this motion. It is just another attempt at a political grab in the last hours of this Parliament, for the Conservatives to somehow grab onto some form of relevancy.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6811193">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253083" Type="2">Calgary Skyview</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811194">I hold in great respect the opportunity to participate in today's debate. The topic of this debate is something I hold close to my heart, as both my brother and father served our country. I witnessed first-hand the honour, integrity and respect they both held for the roles and their time in service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811195"> My father served as an officer in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II on HMCS <I>Stormont</I> in the Battle of the Atlantic. In his recollection of his experience in the navy, he stated, “True leaders lead by their actions, not by the words.” It was a virtue that he carried out throughout his entire life and was the foundation of what made him a noble leader who many respected and looked up to, me included.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811196">My brother, who served as a pilot from 1981 to 1996, was a captain at the National Defence headquarters and also a man who led with a high degree of integrity, righteousness, honesty and the type of honourableness that gains trust from fellow comrades, as well as from citizens for whom my family had the privilege of serving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811197">Lastly, the riding I represent, Edmonton Centre, was previously held by the Hon. Laurie Hawn, who also served in the Canadian military with distinction. I have enormous respect for him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811198">I share these personal stories because they make up only a few of the individuals who have been recognized as contributors to Canada's reputation of having a noble, virtuous, principled and ethical armed forces. It is these folks who we owe great respect to, as they have upheld our entire country to a standard of righteousness, rectitude and reverence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811199">It is because of these noble individuals that we have been able to effortlessly create trust between the armed forces and the public, the very cohesion to create unification, wholeness and a sense of togetherness in this country. It is a cohesion that has been eroded for six straight years, and the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation> has placed all Canadians at risk of ever trusting our armed forces again by covering up sexual misconduct allegations. This is alarming, troublesome and unacceptable. More than that, it is offensive and completely dismissive of all the individuals who have come before the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and those who are currently serving and doing so with a high regard for themselves, their actions and the Canadians they serve. As I stand here today, I cannot help but think about the women in my life and all the women residing in Canada who have witnessed the government shamefully continue to turn a blind eye to this and neglect the previous claim of being a feminist government that empowers women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811200">This is not about the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s military service. We acknowledge that he served with incredible distinction. This is about what is happening today. It is about the impacts these actions and the lack of responsibility have on all Canadians today, and will have moving forward if appropriate measures are not taken. This is about ensuring that we as a country feel immense pride in our institution that continues to serve, that all men and women feel it is a safe place where sexual allegations are taken seriously and that any further incidents of sexual misconduct will be condemned and justice will be served. This is about creating certainty for the men and women currently serving and those who are contemplating joining our armed forces so that if they ever encounter this type of harassment, their government will not turn a blind eye, like this one has continued to do for many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811201">This involves all of us. All of Canada's reputation is on the line. Anyone who genuinely and sincerely cares about the credibility, stature and honour of this country and our institutions would nobly resign and refuse to be selfish by remaining in a role that is no longer held in trust by the people it is meant to serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811202">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to make the choice not to act like a leader in this serious situation and leaves this to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">defence minister</Affiliation>, who has serious allegations against him, the result will be a continued erosion of the relationship between institutions, government and public. The lack of action speaks tremendous volumes about this Prime Minister's leadership and where he stands on equity for all persons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811203">This is not about partisanship and it is certainly not about politics. It is about ethics, morals and the willingness to do the right thing and protect the citizens who serve and the citizens who look to their government and their institutions for protection. How can we expect our honourable armed forces to keep us safe if CAF members themselves do not feel safe in the armed forces?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811204">It is astounding that months after we called for action and years after sexual allegations were released, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to protect his own chief of staff rather than the thousands of men and women who serve this country. That is an insult to all of us. The Prime Minister has blatantly shown us where his true values lie, and it is certainly not with our armed forces and the people who graciously and righteously choose to be of service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811205">We will not back down from holding leaders and all persons in government to the highest standard of honesty and integrity. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals refused to be accountable for their failure on the sexual misconduct allegations made against General Vance three years ago, but they have had the opportunity in the last couple of months and weeks to clean up their actions, recover their reputation and just ask the defence minister to step down. However, instead of the Liberals spending the past few weeks figuring out how they could make this situation better and lead with more dignity and integrity, we found out that the military's second in command, the vice chief of the defence staff, and the commander of the navy went golfing with Canada's former chief of the defence staff, the retired Jonathan Vance, who remains under military police investigation for the alleged inappropriate behaviour we speak of. This is problematic given that the vice chief has oversight of the police force investigating Vance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811206">It is blatantly obvious that the standard of conduct that is being held by the government is shameful and embarrassing, and the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s leadership, or lack thereof, is downright deceitful. Over two months ago, Canada's Conservatives not only continued to speak out about the government's wrongful dismissal of the allegation, but also acknowledged that no amount of words would ever recovery a situation like this one involving the defence minister, as so much trust has been broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811207">This is not something that can be combed over with an apology or long words on the history of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s military service, regardless of how distinguished it is. This requires taking action and responding to the current impacts that the lack of measures has had and will continue to have. Change and reinstatement of a noble government and a noble armed forces can only come through action, the very thing missing from the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811208">This is not a partisan issue. This is certainly not a personal issue against the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. This is a countrywide issue affecting all of us. How could trust be instilled by the same person and persons who lost it and by the ones who are to blame for placing the collectiveness between government, the armed forces and the broader public in discord? The faith in a just and equitable government has diminished and will continue to do so until we see notable activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811209">This is why the Conservatives have laid out an accountable, actionable plan that will be implemented to tackle the issue of sexual misconduct in the armed forces. The plan will recover the trust that has been broken and reinstate the integrity lost. This plan will include an inclusive service-wide independent investigation into the sexual misconduct in the military. It involves suspending all general and flag officer promotions and salary increases while an investigation into sexual misconduct of the military is taking place. Furthermore, it will involve the introduction of policies to ensure that future complaints are made to an external independent body outside the chain of command.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811210">Canada's Conservatives will continue to stand up for women and men in uniform and demand the Liberals end their cover-up of sexual misconduct. We cannot allow our daughters, sisters and mothers to work in unsafe environments. No one should be subjected to sexual harassment when they show up to serve our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811211">I stand here to ensure that any woman or man can serve their country with honour and without compromise. I stand here on behalf of my brother and father, who served and contributed to the uncorrupted and therefore reputable armed forces. I stand here for the thousands of Canadians who so selflessly served in our armed forces and continue to serve. I stand here on behalf of the Conservative Party, but also for every single Canadian who is questioning the character that makes up the government and the morals it leads with. If the government truly believed in leading with the highest degree of integrity, ethics and equity and believed in justice for all, then the decision to censure the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> would occur without hesitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811212"> I will conclude with my father's words, a man who served in the Royal Canadian Navy, from his recollection of his experience in the navy: “True leaders lead by their actions, not by their words.” I stand here and appallingly question the entire government's morals and lack of action and ask it this: If the government is so willing to let this terrible example of abuse of power slide, what else will it let slide?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811230">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this motion. For months, we have heard through the media allegations of sexual misconduct within the Canadian Armed Forces and the complicity of the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. This prompted the Standing Committee on the Status of Women to launch a study into sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces, which we just concluded and the committee report was tabled today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811231">Many of the FEWO study witnesses spoke of the Canadian Armed Forces' challenges with repeated sexual misconduct incidents, with one witness noting, “I joined the Canadian Armed Forces in July of 2018. Since then, I feel like I've experienced a lifetime's worth of sexual assault and misconduct.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811232">Another witness who appeared before the committee gave a very interesting perspective on the double standard that the military justice system has toward women and men. The witness discussed how when they were deployed in Afghanistan an investigation had been conducted into a consensual relationship she had with a U.S. officer who was not in her unit but was of the same rank. She admitted that the relationship she had was against regulations and that she had pleaded guilty to the charges. She was fined, repatriated from theatre and posted out of her unit. She accepted this as her punishment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811233">However, as a result, she was called demeaning names and was told she was not worthy of leading soldiers. She said she was threatened with violence by commanding officers and would be repeatedly chastised by other officers. She was sent to work alone in an office managing a single Excel spreadsheet, and it quickly became clear to her that her career in the Canadian Armed Forces was over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811234">When she left the military, she had originally been given an offer to go into the reserves, but that was revoked upon her leaving, with the commanding officer telling her she was not the type of leader he wanted in his unit. She said that her biggest failure in life was how she was pushed out of the armoured corps, and that is something she continues to carry immense shame for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811235">However, this is precisely the type of leadership displayed by the former chief of the defence staff, who served as the longest-serving chief of the defence staff. This former CDS, General Vance, not only rolled out Operation Honour, but at the same time was having inappropriate relations with those under his command. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811236">That included one woman who, when she appeared before FEWO, mentioned how she had asked questions about who would have the ability to investigate actions against the chief of the defence staff and whether the CFNIS would be the appropriate body. The response the general gave her was that he was “untouchable” because he owned the CFNIS. It was deeply concerning to hear that someone would actually believe he was above the law and would be willing to create an unsafe work environment and felt he could not be investigated. To this day, this woman believes she is not going to get justice for herself, but that it was important for her to come forward so the issue could be dealt with, with the aim that other women in the military would be able to get justice. It is not hard to see why this witness would believe that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811237">Over this past weekend, we heard that while under investigation, General Vance went golfing with Vice-Admiral Baines and Lieutenant-General Rouleau, who himself held oversight authority for the military police. The abuse of authority and the flagrant disregard for women in the Canadian Armed Forces are completely disgusting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811238">Shortly after a witness appeared before our committee, a Facebook group of military police were making comments such as “If you sleep with a senior rank you get good postings and promotion to support the bastards but no parenting and support from the senior rank”. Another said, “Giggity”, while another said, “Her story is about as clear as a PMQ orgy party on pay day.” It is no wonder women do not feel safe in our Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811239">What makes this worse is that all of this occurred under the watch of this <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, who, to this day, has yet to take any responsibility for his role in allowing for this toxic culture to exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811240">When the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> appeared before committee, my <Affiliation DbId="253135" Type="2">colleague</Affiliation> said to him, “[Y]ou're not owning up to the reality that you're not taking action to create a shift in the culture....

The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> just kept repeating the same points. He did not take any responsibility for the actions of the General Vance investigations. </ParaText>

You don't want to tarnish the career or cause the loss of a valuable co-worker who is your right-hand man, for example.

              <ParaText id="6811243">Canadians expect our ministers to represent all Canadians, work to defend all Canadians and support all Canadians. However, all the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has done is protect and excuse the inexcusable, and he has sent a message to all those serving in uniform that as long as one is a man, a friend and high enough in rank, one can sexually assault someone and the minister will turn a blind eye on it. This is not my Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811244">A fundamental change within the Canadian Forces with regard to its toxic culture and sexual misconduct issues is needed to ensure the safety and success of its members. Our brave service members deserve better. Conservatives are committed to ensuring that change occurs in the Canadian Armed Forces and will continue to hold the government to account on its shortcomings on this file, including and especially the need to take responsibility for the ongoing leadership crisis and the harm it has caused. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811245">As a woman, it broke my heart to listen to the witnesses come forward and tell their stories, and how they continue to live with the trauma of sexual misconduct and sexual assault months, years and decades later. We constantly heard from witnesses about how tiring and disrespectful it is to continue to just talk about this issue. These are conversations we have had for decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811246">All of the survivors spoke of the urgency to bring about cultural change, but they and military academics highlighted the requirement of having the most senior leadership, including the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, involved directly in this change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811247">What we have seen from the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is an abdication of his responsibilities in bringing about this change. He testified at committee that even prior to being appointed minister he was aware of this issue. If he truly was aware of this issue and the significance of it, then why has he sat silently on the sidelines while women have suffered significantly under his watch? Why did he turn a blind eye when his buddy, the former chief of the defence staff, was placed under investigation? Why does the minister continue to refuse to bring about true cultural change instead of yet another report?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811248">I guess it is true what they say about Liberals. There is not a problem in the world they cannot solve by just having another report written. The time for reports is over. Women need action now, and we can start by getting rid of this inefficient <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, who places friendship over the security of individuals. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811266">Madam Speaker, in our democracy, Parliament seldom has to have such a serious debate on the failures of one of its members. We must not, under any circumstances, take this situation lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811267">Recent and not-so-recent events are forcing us to question how well one of our own is performing his ministerial duties. There is no denying that we are finding many faults with the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, who must answer to the citizens we represent in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811268">Before formulating my opinion, I want to make one thing clear: The minister is not the only one accountable. There is also the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He is the one who appointed the Minister of National Defence and signed his mandate letter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811269">In my opinion, tonight's debate is inextricably tied to the Prime Minister's judgment and his ability to spring into action when duty calls. Unfortunately, the fact that we are debating this in the House means there is a problem, a breach of our trust in the government on a specific subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811270">The Prime Minister had plenty of opportunities to show the leadership that his role calls for, but he did not. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252627" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation>'s motion is harsh, but the reality is that we are indeed disappointed with the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. The Bloc Québécois called for the minister's resignation just last month. We are even more sure that that is the only possible course since the most recent shameful episode of his term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811271">As opposition members, we have a duty to confront the government and its ministers about their actions. That is the essence of ministerial responsibility. It is the essence of our democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811272">The Liberals blame all their failings on systemic problems, yet they are the ones in charge of the system. There is still time to show that there is at least one working system in Canada that the government has full control over. The only possible course is for the minister to step down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811273">Let us start with some of the less serious criticisms of the minister. First, the minister misled Quebeckers and Canadians over the withdrawal of fighter jets in the fight against ISIS. The minister said that Canada's allies had no problem with the CF‑18s being withdrawn from Operation Impact, shortly after the Liberals came to power in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811274">According to him and the Liberals, Canada's allies understood and respected Canada's decision to withdraw its CF-18s. That is not true. We expect the things a minister says to be true. We would never have expected him to say something so easily refutable, since a minister can usually count on competent staff to help him avoid embarrassment. The situation was the opposite of what the minister was saying: The Iraqis and our allies were strongly opposed to the withdrawal of our aircraft. The media obtained copies of documents indicating that such was the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811275">When confronted with that revelation, the minister alleged in an interview that he had actually wanted Canada to keep its CF-18s there, which says a lot about the liberties the minister takes with the facts when it involves our allies. Sadly, the minister's blunders do not end there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811276">The government knows as well as I do that many Quebeckers and Canadians are proud of our military capabilities and the people responsible for our success. Many Quebeckers and Canadians respect and recognize the work being done by those risking their lives for us and our freedom. Our fellow citizens are humbled by the accomplishments of our soldiers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811277">Meanwhile, during a speech in India, the minister said that he was the architect of Operation Medusa in 2006 in Afghanistan. Actually, I should say that he took credit for the work of his colleagues. To give a little bit of background, this operation managed to surround and eliminate up to 700 Taliban fighters who had gathered to launch attacks on allied bases. Canada, the Afghan army and other allied nations managed to defeat the Taliban soldiers. The offensive was led by Canada thanks to many of our military officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811278">The men and women who serve Quebec and Canada are very proud of their teamwork. Teamwork is not about playing the hero for the public or showing off at a reception by making self-important boasts. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811279">Operations are not carried out solo, especially not operations like that one. Even de Gaulle, Churchill and MacArthur would never have claimed to be the architects of anything whatsoever. No matter the context, planning an operation depends heavily on intel from troops on the ground and the tactical skills of all kinds of people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811280">At the time, the minister was involved in planning Operation Medusa, but he was not working alone. Bringing this up again in 2021 seems silly, but it is part of a continuum of untruths and deceit that point to the minister's priority being his own self-interest. But wait, there is more. The minister presided over the indictment and removal of Vice-Admiral Norman. More Quebeckers and Canadians should be familiar with that story. The whole thing is an embarrassment and unworthy of the offices held.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811281">Shortly before the 2015 federal election, the Conservatives announced that they had at long last granted a contract to convert a container ship into an oiler replenishment ship for the Royal Navy. The plan was to build that ship, the <I>Asterix</I>, at the Davie shipyard in Quebec, for once. When the Liberals took office in 2015, the first thing they did was try to cancel the contract in favour of the Irving family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811282">Scott Brison, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s good friend and the former president of the Treasury Board, was very close to the Irving family. He knew them. It is perfectly simple. He tried to derail the contract. I will give Mr. Brison credit for finally backing down once the story hit the media. It is very typical Liberal behaviour. That always seems to be the Liberal approach to decision-making. Do the Toronto Star, Global News, CBC and Radio-Canada know about this? If not, then we will do it. Do they know about this? If so, then we will not do it. That is how the Liberals operate. Sadly, it did not stop there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811283">The Liberals chose to behave like an angry mob: find the whistle blower and take him out. Who better than the good old RCMP to act as the political police and investigate the leak? That is what led to the filing of charges against Vice‑Admiral Mark Norman, who at one time was the second-highest ranking officer in the Canadian Armed Forces under General Vance. Instead of standing up and ending the witch hunt, the minister did what he does best, in other words protect his interests and the interests of the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811284">The Minister of Defence, like the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, did not defend Norman when Vance accused him publicly. The minister even supported Vance's decision to suspend Norman in 2017. As I said, that is embarrassing. It happened one year before Norman was formally charged with leaking confidential documents. “When the decision was made, I supported it”, the minister said. The Prime Minister still owes him for that, because he again looked ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811285">The numerous documents obtained by Norman's defence team proved that the Liberals were trying to rip up the contract. The government was so embarrassed that Brison resigned from all his roles. Even more embarrassingly, Norman was eventually completely exonerated, but he never got his job back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811286">The minister is not a team player. How many people have left under his leadership? Five, six, seven or eight people have left, and that cannot continue. Sometimes life gives us subtle signs. Can the minister see these signs? Can the Prime Minister see them? We, the opposition parties, certainly can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811287">It is also difficult to ignore what happened to former ombudsman Gary Walbourne. Several of my colleagues, who are more eloquent than I am, had the opportunity to speak more specifically about the problem of sexual misconduct in the army. The minister has become known for his failures on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811288">Nevertheless, I want to come back to it because it ties in with what I was saying earlier in my speech. The Liberals' little clique was not happy with the ombudsman, an extremely important official in the Canadian military. He was dragged through the mud, accused of terrible things and had his funding cut off. The minister was at the centre of the disagreement with Gary Walbourne, who was just trying to do his job. When he approached the minister about setting their differences aside to address an issue more important than their feud, specifically an allegation that General Vance had committed sexual misconduct towards a female soldier, the minister did little if anything.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811289">He did not want to hear about it, so he passed the puck to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. Remember, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> is the boss of the department. Quite aside from the substance of the case, which is terrible, I am interested in the minister's behaviour. The one time in his career when he could have really been the architect of something, he looked the other way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811290">He could have spearheaded a complete overhaul of the culture at the Canadian Armed Forces, but instead, we lost three years. The survivors lost three years. Once again, the Minister of National Defence has not demonstrated that he is a team player. Worse still, when the story first broke, he denied it, then admitted it, then pointed the finger at Gary Walbourne's incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811291">The next step, taken straight out of the Liberal crisis management playbook, is to blame something systemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811292">I have my own theory. A problematic culture, a systemic problem, is not an incantation. Something must be done. Waiting to be painted into a corner before deciding to do something is not worthy of the office of minister. That is exactly what we are talking about today, being worthy of the office, being responsible and accountable. The minister is no longer worthy of his office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811293">The Prime Minister may not see that, but I hope my hon. colleagues do.</ParaText>

The systemic lack of work on this issue extends beyond just this Department of National Defence file and veterans. I think it is also in Parliament. Perhaps the member could expand on that, because I think it is important to note that it is not an acceptable excuse that it is systemic when the Liberals have been in power for so long.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811328">Many colleagues have spoken very eloquently on this debate, including the member for <Affiliation DbId="252986" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation>. A lot of people have brought their own personal experiences to this House today and have spoken passionately on why there needs to be a cultural change in our armed forces.</ParaText>

However, people who are close to me have. Talking with them about the experiences they have gone through, I have always taken this very seriously. It is a passion of mine that any kind of sexual harassment should be stopped dead in its tracks. We should stand up for the victims, always.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811330">Some of the questions from the Liberal MPs today invoked the minister's past history. That is not what we are here to discuss today. We are here to discuss his overseeing of a continuation of sexual harassment and a culture of depravity in our armed forces. We need to listen to the victims when they come forward. That is what we are discussing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811331">For my Liberal colleagues, we are not tarnishing the record of the minister's service when he was a soldier in the armed forces; we are talking about his record as the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> of our country. It is not well suited for him to continue in this position. He misled Canadians when it came to the fighter jets. He misled Canadians when it came to Vice-Admiral Norman. He made sure that the culture of sexual harassment could continue in the armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811332">When some of our senior people in the Canadian Armed Forces are golfing with someone who has had that charge brought against them, it shows a complete and utter disrespect for the members of the armed forces who have come forward to talk about their harrowing sexual harassment experiences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811333">The victims are not the only ones who have to go through this. Their family members do as well. They are there to support the victims when they have nowhere else to turn. For those family members, this does not go away. There is a lifetime of trying to get through what has happened at the hands of the aggressor. It is something that needs to be stopped in its tracks, and if the minister has shown an inability to do that, we need to hold him to account in this House by voting in favour of this motion. He does not have the moral authority or the legitimacy to continue on in his role as the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> for our country. The House has to say that in one voice. That would show that we do want this culture in the Canadian Armed Forces to change. It is something we need to do as a single voice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811334">I appreciate all the speeches from my Bloc colleagues, my NDP colleagues and everyone in the opposition who is going to stand with the victims of sexual assault in the Canadian Armed Forces by saying, “No more.” It cannot continue. Something or someone needs to be put in place to change that culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811335">We could just look at the department plan, for example. A colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252550" Type="2">Edmonton West</Affiliation>, pointed this out to me. This is almost unforgivable. The goal for the Department of National Defence is to have 12% or less people reporting sexual harassment. That is the target. That is the goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811336">Colleagues, that goal should be zero, not 12%. If they cannot figure that out on the other side of the House, then most of them are not fit to be in the positions they are in. There should not be a 12% goal of sexual harassment in any department anywhere in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811337">The Liberals have said they are going to bring back reports. Some of these reports have not brought in any goals since 2018. The Liberals always say there are systemic issues in the departments or systems in Canada. They always like to say they are the natural governing party of Canada. Liberals have been in office more than anyone else, so it is their systems that they say they cannot change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811338">If they are not willing to do it, in the Conservative Party of Canada we have a government-in-waiting that will not stand for sexual harassment in our Canadian Armed Forces. Our goal will be zero sexual harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces, not 12%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811339">I am sure that when the member for <Affiliation DbId="252627" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation> sends out his mandate letters to ministers, especially to the minister of defence, it will mention the culture of sexual harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces and the fact that it needs to change.

              <ParaText id="6811340">That is not what is happening right now. Many colleagues who have very good relationships with the members of the Canadian Armed Forces have told their stories. They have said that it is almost impossible to continue to have respect for a minister who continues to let them down time and again. This is not a single instance. There are four or five defining moments in this <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s career over the past six years when he has failed to measure up to the bar of the minister of defence, whether it be Vice-Admiral Norman, the fighter jets, his taking liberties with his own record, or the sexual assault of individuals in the Canadian Armed Forces.

              <ParaText id="6811349">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for this opportunity to speak about the government-wide main estimates for 2021-22.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811350">As members know, on February 25, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="253377" Type="4">Minister of Seniors</Affiliation> tabled, on behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="253369" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>, the annual departmental plans and the main estimates, 2021-22.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811351">These main estimates have been studied and last week the <Affiliation DbId="253369" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> put forward the motion that the main estimates, less the amounts voted in the interim supply, be approved by this House. Today, I would like to explain why this is so important and the steps the government has taken to ensure transparency and accountability in government spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811352">As Canadians continue to fight COVID‑19 and its devastating impacts, the main estimates set out the government's requests for the financing needed to fund its ongoing operations in the year ahead.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811353">As we all know, when the COVID‑19 pandemic hit, it plunged our country into our worst recession since the Great Depression. Tens of thousands of businesses closed down, and jobs and incomes were lost all across the country. The hardest hit were seniors, women, young people, racialized communities, low-income workers and small businesses, especially in the tourism and hospitality industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811354">The pandemic took the lives of too many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811355">An essential part of Canada's fight against COVID‑19 has been the unprecedented support made available to Canadians and Canadian businesses by the government. We knew Canadians needed a lifeline to get through the COVID‑19 storm, so we launched programs to help our citizens, like the Canada emergency response benefit, the Canada emergency student benefit, the Canada emergency wage subsidy and targeted support for regions, economic sectors and not-for-profit organizations. This approach has worked, but the storm is not over. Canadians continue to need the government's ongoing support as businesses reopen and the economy is repaired and built back better for everyone. The funds requested in these main estimates will help the government do just that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811356">Government organizations are seeking funds to continue delivering already approved programs and services and to make investments to support Canadians during the pandemic and create the right conditions for a successful economic recovery. The funds requested reflect our ongoing commitment to investing in Canada's pandemic response, from economic support for individuals and businesses to paying for vaccines, enhancing support for mental health tools, virtual health care and more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811357">The main estimates provide information about the $342.2 billion in proposed expenditures for 123 organizations. That amount can be broken down into $141.9 billion for voted expenditures and $200.3 billion for statutory expenditures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811358">Statutory expenditures have already been authorized in existing legislation, such as the COVID‑19 Emergency Response Act and the Canada Recovery Benefits Act, so they are presented in the budget for information only.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811359">In March, roughly $59 billion of the $141.9 billion in voted expenditures was approved to cover the requirements of organizations for the first three months of the fiscal year, including to continue the government's key operations, and for COVID‑19 response measures and emergency reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811360"> Of the total $342.2 billion being requested in the main estimates, just over $22 billion is related to the COVID‑19 pandemic response, split almost evenly between voted and statutory expenditures. This includes just over $10 billion for the Canada recovery benefit, the Canada recovery sickness benefit and the Canada recovery caregiving benefit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811361">Other significant changes in statutory spending from last year's main estimates include updates to major transfer payments, such as elderly benefits, the Canada health transfer and an increased climate action incentive payment published in the fall economic statement 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811362">Let me now focus on some of the larger organizations in these estimates. There are six organizations seeking more than $5 billion each in voted budgetary expenditures.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811363">One of these is the Public Health Agency of Canada, which is asking Parliament for authorization to spend $8.7 billion. PHAC will use the money to continue its important work helping Canadians deal with the pandemic by investing in COVID‑19 vaccines, therapeutic products, medical equipment and PPE, as well as closing gaps in biomanufacturing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811364">PHAC is also responsible for maintaining quarantine facilities funded by the federal government, strengthening its border and health travel program and helping municipalities offer safe voluntary isolation sites to prevent the virus from spreading further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811365">Although the main estimates reflect government spending in response to the COVID‑19 pandemic, they also demonstrate ongoing support for other priorities that are crucial to Canadians' interests, such as national security and defence.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811366">The Department of National Defence is presenting $22.8 billion in voted expenditures in the 2021-22 main estimates, which include investments in the “Strong, Secure, Engaged” defence policy, as well as important funding for equipment upgrades. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811367">There is also the Department of Indigenous Services, which is seeking $13.4 billion. Included for Indigenous Services Canada in the estimates is a proposed net increase of $508.6 million to improve access to safe, clean drinking water in first nations communities. In addition, proposed spending includes increases of $122.6 million for supportive care in indigenous communities and $104.7 million for education programs at the elementary, secondary and post-secondary levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811368">The fourth organization I will highlight is the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, which is seeking $7 billion through these main estimates.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811369">These planned expenditures include a number of votes that are centrally managed by Treasury Board ministers and total nearly $3.7 billion. The funds are allocated to federal organizations and facilitate the Treasury Board's roles as employer, management board and budget office of the government. Just over $3 billion is also set aside for its responsibilities as an employer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811370">These expenditures will be used to make payments under the public service pension, benefits and insurance plans, including the employer's contribution to health, income maintenance and life insurance premiums.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811371">Finally, the main estimates of the Treasury Board Secretariat also include a net increase of $27 million for program spending. The main objective of this increase is to improve diversity and inclusion in the public service and to ensure that the Canadian Digital Service can continue to provide critical digital products and services related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811372">Another important priority for the government is international development and diplomacy. Through the proposed funding of the $6.3 billion in these estimates, Global Affairs Canada will continue to implement Canada's feminist foreign policy and support actions to reduce poverty and fragility in developing countries. Global Affairs Canada will also work with global partners to promote trade and continue to strengthen its consular program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811373">Hon. colleagues, Canadians also care about how we treat our veterans and how we want the government to honour their service. These men and women are the veterans who served to protect the very rights and freedoms we enjoy today. With the proposed funding in these estimates of $6.2 billion, Veterans Affairs Canada will continue to deliver important services and ensure benefit programs continue to meet the needs of our veterans.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811374">I would like to mention a couple of other organizations that provide essential services to Canadians: the Canada Border Services Agency, or CBSA, and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The CBSA provides border services that support national security policies and facilitates the flow of people and goods across the border. To do this, it is requesting just over $1.8 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811375">The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation helps Canadians meet their housing needs. For example, it works with the provinces and territories, first nations, as well as the private and non-profit sectors to improve access to affordable housing. It is requesting approximately $3.3 billion to carry out its activities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811376">We would also like to assure Canadians that their government is committed to the principles of openness, transparency and accountability, especially in times of rapid change. Let me turn to that now, beginning with the overall estimates process, of which these main estimates are a part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811377"> In our system of Parliament, the estimates are crucial to ensuring transparency and accountability in the government’s use of public money. The main estimates, supplementary estimates, departmental plans and departmental results reports, in conjunction with the public accounts, all help parliamentarians scrutinize government spending. I cannot overstate how important this information is to the functioning of our system of government. In fact, accountability is predicated on parliamentarians knowing how public funds are being spent, so that they can hold the government to account for its actions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811378">The government fully recognizes its responsibility and its commitment to accountability to Canadians through the members of Parliament who represent them. This commitment has taken on a special significance since the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic and the emergency measures taken by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811379">Due to the unprecedented levels of spending in response to the pandemic, the government provided Parliament information that went beyond what is normally presented. For example, in the spring of 2020, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> began submitting to the Standing Committee on Finance a biweekly report on statutory spending in response to the pandemic. As for the estimates, we are providing side reports, with a detailed list of statutory authorities and an online annex on estimated pandemic-related expenditures.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811380">There is also a complete breakdown of these planned expenditures by standard object, such as personnel, professional services, transfer payments and more. This information on planned spending on the COVID-19 response, along with estimated expenditures, is also publicly available on GC InfoBase, an easy-to-use online tool, and through the open government portal. By developing these datasets and digital tools, we are demonstrating our commitment to providing parliamentarians and Canadians with more information on where public funds are going and how they are being spent. To close the loop on expenditure reporting for the fiscal year, the government will also report on actual expenditures and results in the public accounts and departmental results reports in the fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811381"> Hon. colleagues, the government is committed to being open and transparent with Canadians and their representatives, particularly during this pandemic. We have introduced special measures to help our citizens, businesses and communities from all regions during these challenging times. Many of these measures were passed in Parliament through emergency legislation and continue to help Canadians through the crisis. Again, the full disclosure of all these is paramount for the government.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811382">I should also mention part III of the main estimates, the departmental plans and the departmental results reports, which work together and have been part of the government's efforts to improve accountability to Parliament for the last 25 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811383">In recent years, the government has tabled the main estimates and the departmental plans at about the same time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811384">The departmental plans show how each department plans to achieve results and provide further details on the resources requested in the main estimates. They also establish a link between program performance, expected results, commitments set out in the ministers' mandate letters, and government priorities. Departmental plans are organized according to core responsibilities and expected results, which are the baseline against which organizations monitor and report on their end-of-year performance.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811385">That reporting and tracking is done through the department's subsequent departmental results reports, which are tabled in Parliament after the end of the fiscal year, at around the same time as the public accounts. All this detailed information is available on GC InfoBase, as well as departmental web sites. These reporting mechanisms ensure parliamentarians and Canadians can easily track our priorities and plan spending to see how we are achieving results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811386">I have gone into some detail describing the monies requested through these main estimates, why it is important and how we are ensuring transparency and accountability with respect to government spending, but let me come back to the key point. The story of the main estimates 2021-22 is more than just a story about numbers and expenditure management. It is a story about Canadians looking after each other. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811387">We all know how hard the pandemic has hit Canadians and their families. It has been a matter of life and death for some, financial hardship for many and protecting our loved ones for us all. That is why the government acted quickly over the past year to provide financial help for individuals, businesses and the health care system. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811388">A good number of these measures are ongoing in 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811389">These measures placed real pressure on many departments, which must continue to provide these emergency measures in addition to their core programs and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811390">As parliamentarians, our work consists in ensuring that government organizations have the financial resources required to do the work that Canadians expect of them. Departments must have the financial capacity to continue protecting Canadians, and the funding proposed in these estimates will let them do that this upcoming fiscal year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811391">In closing, in the upcoming year, we will face ongoing and new challenges. The main estimates attest to the government's commitment to address these challenges while continuing to work on other national priorities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811392">It has been a long journey, and if COVID-19 has taught us anything, it is that we are in this together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811393">I would like to close my remarks by thanking my hon. colleagues on all sides of the House for their ongoing collaboration as we work together to help Canadians during these difficult times. As we finish the fight against COVID-19 and rebuild a resilient, economic recovery that creates jobs and growth for our people, I know that the government can count on members' support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811423">I mentioned in my question earlier that the reason we are here today is to discuss the estimates, specifically as they relate to transport. My message here today is about the overwhelming incompetence of the government regarding transport. The estimates here today are just a symptom of that. There have been so many instances in which the government has not delivered on the file of transport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811424">Regarding airlines, for months the airline sector waited for a plan from the government. I have gone through the timeline before and will attempt to go through it briefly today. On March 18, 2020, the international border closed. On March 21, Porter Airlines suspended operations. On March 23, Sunwing Airlines suspended operations. There was no plan from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811425">On April 1, Air Transat concluded repatriation operations. On April 18, Air Transat suspended flights. On April 20, Air Canada concluded repatriation operations. There was still no plan. On June 30, Air Canada announced it was discontinuing services to 30 regional routes and closed eight stations. On July 17, WestJet concluded its repatriation operations. On July 23, Air Transat restored operations. On June 24, WestJet laid off 3,333 employees through restructuring. There was still no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811426">On July 31, Air Canada posted $1.7 billion in quarterly losses. On August 14, the Government of Canada introduced flight plans. On September 1, Nav Canada increased fees by 29.5%. There was still no plan. On September 23, Air Canada announced a COVID-19 testing pilot project at Toronto Pearson Airport. On October 1, Air Canada ordered approved rapid tests. There was still no plan. On October 14, WestJet suspended routes to Atlantic Canada. On November 2, the Calgary Airport quarantine and testing projects began. There was still no plan. On November 6, Sunwing Airlines restored operations briefly, but there was still no plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811427">We have seen this continue through the fall, the winter and now the spring with no plan from the government. However, promises were made. Promises were made by the Liberals on March 10, 2020. When asked what the government could do to help airlines, the <Affiliation DbId="253380" Type="4">Minister of Economic Development</Affiliation> said, “What we’re looking at is how can we mitigate the impacts while making sure that we can have, still, a strong summer season, and that we can really bounce back.” We did not see anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811428">On March 19, 2020, then finance minister Bill Morneau said, “We will be refining what we’ve done, we will be thinking about next steps. We are working hard with the airline sector.” Still, there was no plan. On March 20, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s government promised a plan to help the industry that would follow an $82 billion aid package that was announced earlier that week, yet still nothing happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811429">For months we heard empty promises from the government. Devastating actions were occurring in the airline sector, yet there was no plan. Finally, when we saw not even plans, but deals with specific airlines begin to emerge as brought forward previously in the House by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252595" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation>, we found out the government was incapable of creating deals without taking care that there would be no executive compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811430">When I demanded a plan for the airline sector in the House several times over, I made my demands clear: support for regional routes, protection of workers and, most importantly, making sure that taxpayer funds were not used for executive bonuses. However, Air Canada, with which an agreement was negotiated, was awarded $10 million to give bonuses to executives, and the government was incapable of excluding this when it made its plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811431">I wish I could say this was the only incident of government incompetence when it comes to executive bonuses. We found out, not a week later, that Nav Canada handed out $7 million in executive bonuses after laying off 700 workers and increasing airport fees by 30%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811442">Madam Speaker, I do not believe I recognized someone as being in the House or not. I was recognizing who delivered a speech. There is a difference between the two. One indicates the physical presence of someone, which is what the Standing Orders say we are not able to comment on, and the other indicates someone who gives an address. For example, because this is specifically regarding transport, I expect we would hear from the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>. I distinguish one as being physical and the other as an individual delivering a speech. I will leave it there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811443">I will go back to the third letter I did not receive a response to, about ballast waters as I said, which have a major effect not only on shippers, but also on supply chains in the country. I sent this letter on May 31 and I have yet to hear a response. Again, this is more incompetence by government and the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. I sent a letter on June 9 to the Minister of Transport regarding shipping containers, which are causing major stress for exporters as they attempt to get their goods out of the country to international markets, and I have yet to receive a response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811444">Most insulting not only to me, but to the individuals who asked me to take on this task, was the presentation of pins with insignias of airline sector companies that I made to the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> on March 11. I received no correspondence from him saying he had received the pins. In fact, I posted a video on social media of me delivering the pins. I was outside his door with this presentation and he never got back to me. This presentation of hundreds of company insignia pins from workers in the airlines sector who have lost their jobs is now sitting in my office if he would like to contact me to claim it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811445">Another example of the government's incompetence with regard to the transport sector is the reannouncement of announcements. The night before last, my staff said the <Affiliation DbId="253366" Type="4">Minister of Infrastructure</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> were making an announcement the next morning at the Macdonald-Cartier airport, and we had better be ready to respond. We did not have to be ready, because the government did what it always does: It reannounced funds that had been announced already. It made a spectacle of it in a press conference rather than following through with actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811446">We have seen sign after sign of incompetence by the government, but most frustrating in this moment is the lack of a restart plan from the government not only for the airline sector, but for Canadians in general. Other jurisdictions are moving ahead. I am very disappointed that I do not have the opportunity to hear from the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> at this time in this regard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811463">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today and take this opportunity to share my thoughts on the recently tabled transportation estimates. These estimates, which are based upon budget 2021, have failed to present the needed road map and economic recovery plan that would lead us out of this pandemic in a timely manner. Not surprisingly, these estimates are just as disappointing as the budget itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811464">Transportation is a critical component to our travel and tourism industry. Without the important role played by the transportation sector, Canadians and international visitors alike would be unable to experience the amazing sights, culture, landscapes, attractions and history that Canada has to offer. While a great number of provinces and territories are getting closer to a reopening of their economies, with plans in place, the federal government's lack of preparedness in its own jurisdiction poses a major obstacle in accelerating our economic reopening progress as a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811465">Let us take the Canadian cruise ship industry for example. Last February, the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> banned cruise ship activity in Canada for a full year, without even considering whether health conditions could improve faster to allow the industry to resume earlier and salvage part of the late summer or early fall season this year. Instead, it was a blanket ban for a full year. Meanwhile, the Americans took this issue with an approach much different and far more optimistic. They could restart their American industry much sooner and responsibly before Canada's cruise ban ends in February 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811466">Consequently, our neighbours to the south have recently introduced legislation to allow American cruise ships to bypass Canadian ports on the west coast during voyages between Seattle and Alaska. As a result, Canada's west coast cruise industry is at risk of losing its spot in this marketplace. There is a real fear that these proposed changes could one day become permanent, which would have a devastating impact on Canadian coastline economies. Thousands of jobs in the tourism and maritime service industry rely on the safe operation of cruise ships between Canada and the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811467">As the American cruise ship industry begins to resume safe operations and with Canadian industry making it clear that a plan is urgently needed to save its 2022 season, there is still no safe restart strategy for cruise ships in Canada. We can blame the federal Liberals and their indifference and naivety for the unnecessary turmoil and economic loss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811468">Another example of the federal government's lack of preparedness can be found in its transportation consideration at our international land border crossings. There are four major international bridge crossings in my Niagara Falls riding alone. These include the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie, the Rainbow Bridge and Whirlpool Bridge in Niagara Falls, and the Queenston and Lewiston Bridge in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Before COVID, all four bridges were critical in facilitating travellers and trade in a timely manner. However, since COVID, all four bridges have struggled greatly without emergency financial assistance from our federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811469">When the American federal government stepped up to support the bridge authorities on its side of the Niagara River, financial aid from our federal government was nowhere in sight. I have written to the minister about this issue and still no action has been taken. One would imagine that CBSA officers who are front line, outward facing and essential workers would be prioritized by the federal government, their employer, to get vaccinated earlier. Instead, vaccines only began to arrive in Niagara for CBSA officers a few weeks ago, and this only happened after I asked the minister responsible about this in question period. It should not be this hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811470"> Another border challenge involving transportation is quickly coming and it will be here before we know it. In my discussions with local bridge authorities, there is a major concern about how the logistics of reopening these bridges and testing travellers will work from a border management perspective. What is to be avoided from their perspective is a plan that will result in border delays so long and dreadful that it may deter U.S. travellers from coming into Canada altogether. That is why we have been asking for months now for the government to present a safe and responsible federal reopening plan. When will this be announced?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811471">As I have said many times in the House, COVID-19 hit our travel and tourism industry first, it hit it the hardest and it will take this industry the longest time to recover. These estimates are tone deaf to the fact that we are still fighting this pandemic nearly 15 months after it started. In addition to lacking any coordinated effort of sense of a recovery plan, there is scant to no mention of sector specific support measures for those hardest hit in our transportation sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811472">Let us take motor coach buses for example. This industry has been a key component for connecting Canadians and visitors in rural and remote areas to the larger urban centres and beyond. However, COVID has been relentless against this sector.</ParaText>

The limited opportunity presented by a restricted summer will not be sufficient for businesses to accrue the liquidity required to make it to summer 2022, our next peak travel period.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6811478">Pressure is mounting on this issue. Earlier this week, the Canadian press reported that Canadian business leaders were demanding a plan from Ottawa to reopen our borders and our economy now. Perrin Beatty, the chief executive officer of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, is quoted as calling Canada an outlier in failing to provide a fully fledged reopening plan that includes vaccination rates and other criteria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811479">What are the Liberals waiting for? We need them to coordinate and co-operate among themselves with industry, with business leaders and with our international partners to come up with a safe and responsible reopening plan so we can get life back to normal as quickly as possible. Canadian businesses and industries are eagerly seeking clarity and certainty from their federal government. Instead, it is becoming more clear by the day that the federal leadership, in this regard, is sorely absent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811480">Transportation, travel and tourism are among some of the hardest-hit sectors of our economy. It is going to take some time for them to recover. In fact, many businesses in these sectors are in survival mode, while they watch other parts of our economy reopen more quickly. The reality is that travel and tourism will not restart overnight. While 2019 was a record year for many Canadian tourism businesses, the Tourism Industry Association of Canada estimates it could take until at least 2025 before 2019 levels are achieved again. The Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada fears it could lose nearly 30 years of economic progress in its sector if more emergency financial support is not provided soon by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811481">Before this pandemic, Canada's travel and tourism industry was the country's fifth-largest sector, responsible for $105 billion in revenue, or 2.3% of GDP. It employed one in 10 Canadians, or 10% of Canadian jobs, and had 225,000 small and medium-sized businesses across Canada. It is terrible to see how much economic damage, loss, suffering and setback have been caused by this prolonged 15-month pandemic. It is even more terrible to know that our federal government, whose key responsibility is to protect its citizens and Canadian interests, was not ready to protect us at the start, and 15 long months later, it remains unprepared to provide a clear plan forward on safely and responsibly reopening our economy and our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811482">It should never be lost on any Canadian that the Liberal government prorogued Parliament last summer in the midst of a national pandemic health crisis. Let that resonate for a moment; think about it.

              <ParaText id="6811531">As members know, in response to the 2008-09 financial crisis, the OECD has been working hard to combat the use of tax havens. It was then that countries started to seriously go after tax havens within the OECD by launching a broad multilateral instrument on international taxation and tax base recovery called the framework on base erosion and profit shifting, better known as BEPS. Some progress has been made since the initiative was launched, but not much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811532">We are facing a global economic crisis, as countries took on record amounts of debt in an effort to provide income support and stabilize the economy. These efforts are absolutely warranted when they are well done and well used. However, this crisis is a reason to emphasize that everyone needs to pay their fair share and implement, once and for all, the recommendations proposed by the OECD. This is extremely important. It is a matter of justice and tax fairness.</ParaText>

It is clear the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants to make it look like he is taking action on tax evasion while he continues to protect the wealthiest among us.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6811551">Mr. Speaker, even though I always run out of time, I will allow myself the luxury of taking a few seconds to extend a personal greeting to you. I will take advantage of the fact that I am delivering a speech in your presence to say that, during the brief time that we have worked together, you have been very pleasant and very efficient. I really enjoy your creative way with the French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811552">Now to the matter at hand. I really have a lot to say about the main estimates and the supplementary estimates. I will try to be efficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811553">First of all, we need to talk about how this money is being spent. We need to talk about how this money comes in from across the country and is being taken out of the hands of levels of government that are closer to the people. Case in point, health transfers to Quebec and the provinces. I simply cannot rise in the House to talk about expenditures and budgets without talking about that injustice. The provinces are unanimous in their demand for $28 billion, but that is not in the budget. The federal share has to go up to 35%. That is essential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811554">I will also talk about old age security. How could anyone possibly sleep at night after voting for a budget that, with a deficit of nearly $400 billion, does not improve the quality of life of those who built our society? I can still hardly believe it, and every time I talk about it in the House, I get a feeling of revulsion that turns my stomach. It is outrageous, and I urge the government to act quickly on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811555">Some may think no one is talking about this anymore, but we have people calling our offices and commenting on social media every day, asking us what we are doing, why they are not hearing about this issue anymore, and whether we are still discussing it. I always reply that we still are, and that is what I am doing here tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811556">Now I would like to talk about the securities regulator. In this budget implementation case we want to pull back spending. Fortunately, my favourite MP, who spoke before me, was very effective in committee and managed to reduce the funding. We must be vigilant, and I invite the members of this Parliament, especially the opposition, to be vigilant with us and block any possible return of this odious attempt to further dispossess and weaken Quebec. This is unacceptable. We cannot accept losing control of our economic institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811557">A provision in the budget implementation bill states that companies that received the Canada emergency wage subsidy may not pay bonuses to their senior executives. Someone should have mentioned that to Air Canada. Fortunately, public pressure did the job. I think measures like these are appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811558">However, I cannot help but draw a parallel with the fact that the wage subsidy was used by almost everyone here except us. Every party in the House benefited from that subsidy, or rather abused it; I am not sure which word to use. It is a measure that we voted in favour of in good faith to help our businesses, but people will use that money for their election campaigns in the coming months. If that is not scandalous, I do not know what is. Not only do the parties need to stop receiving the subsidy, they also need to pay it back. That money does not belong to the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811559">I could speak at length about what was done during the COVID‑19 crisis, including the Canada emergency response benefit, CERB, which discouraged people from working. We rose many times in the House to have CERB help people get back to work. CERB harmed our businesses. It has left a mark and it is not over. The topic comes up every time I meet with my municipalities. This is a crazy situation knowing that we have a labour shortage. Earlier my colleague mentioned that using foreign workers was one way to overcome the labour shortage. These foreign workers are essential in many sectors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811560">The Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship is in chaos right now. Nothing is moving. Visa processing has been suspended and businesses are not getting answers. They are calling us and are desperate. Even we have a hard time getting answers for them. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811561">There are certain changes that could reasonably be made right now, for example to the percentage of temporary foreign workers authorized to work in the agri-food industries. This has been discussed a lot at the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, and the members unanimously agreed that the percentage must be doubled at least. Let us do it. Let us make it easier for these people to integrate as well. The Bloc Québécois has made some concrete proposals, such as offering three-year visas; doing fewer market impact assessments because they are not really necessary since the job market does not change that quickly; and allowing for flexibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811562">I spoke about the agri-food sector, but I also want to talk about the hospitality and tourism industries. They are really struggling. Restaurants are shutting down in my riding. It is heartbreaking to see, since these institutions have been around 25, 30 or 40 years. They are so good that they put towns on the map. These establishments have put up signs saying that they do not have the staff to reopen. We need to find solutions. One way to get more workers for our businesses is to vote for smart measures that encourage people to find work. I am talking about incentives rather than disincentives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811563">I would be remiss if I talked about temporary foreign workers without mentioning that, on June 9, the Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec, the Association des producteurs de fraises et framboises du Québec, and the Quebec Produce Growers Association urged the Liberal government not to abandon them, but that is precisely what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811564">Let us remember when the mandatory quarantines were established. Would anyone here have dared to say that a foreign worker need not quarantine for 14 days? No one would have. Let us remember that the Bloc Québécois has always clearly stated that quarantines are a federal responsibility. The government did not carry out its responsibilities. It downloaded them onto our farmers. Yes, farmers are capable of carrying them out. Yes, they managed this in an extraordinary way, but it was not up to them to do it, and it was especially not up to them to pay for it. Not only were they forced to manage the quarantines and to provide multiple housing units, but, in addition, they have to pay the workers when they are here, which is only right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811565">The government introduced a measure, namely a $1,500 support. In their letter, which I believe and hope was acknowledged, they ask that this program be maintained. Yesterday, June 16, the amount was cut in half to $750. Why? Does it cost less to quarantine now than it did two weeks ago? Is it not as necessary now as it was two weeks ago?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811566">I am going to read the last sentence from the minister's announcement because I do not have the time to read more. “This program will be available as long as the Quarantine Act is in force and the isolation protocol is followed.” Is that not currently the case? The government and the minister must keep their word and not abandon our producers before the war on COVID‑19 is over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811567">On top of that, there is also the Switch Health saga. They have calculated the costs. A standard 14-day quarantine costs $1,750 per worker, but $3,000 if the worker has to quarantine at a hotel. With all the chaos caused by Switch Health, it costs $113 more per worker per additional day, and $223 more per worker per additional day if the worker is quarantining at a hotel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811568">What is the government telling farmers about that? The government is saying that it is sorry that it has put farmers in dire straits but that it took two months to work things out. That is unacceptable. We need to support our farmers. We need to think about the people on the ground when voting on all of these expenditures. I want to briefly mention what has been happening in the House over the past few days and invite members of this Parliament to work constructively in the few days we have left. We have a pile of fundamental bills that we need to vote on. </ParaText>

What measures have been taken to promote permanent residency for foreign workers? Of course, there have been pilot projects, but it takes a long time to set things up. Can we innovate? Can we use our heads?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811575">Also, there are other ways to make up for the labour shortage, including through innovation, a bit of mechanization, and automation, but that takes investments. There is chronic underinvestment across the entire agri-food industry in Canada and Quebec right now. That makes me worry a lot about the future. When one has not invested in one's house in a long time, sometimes it seems as though it would be cheaper to tear it down and build a new one. </ParaText>

We have seen over the last 15 months, as our country has entered into this unparalleled health crisis, incredible bravery and incredible dedication on behalf of all those Canadians who have tried to keep us alive and well, and who continue to serve us during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811591">Now, we can look, and there is a potential light at the end of the tunnel, as we start to see, slowly, the number of infections going down. We still have much work to do, there is no doubt, but we can start to envisage what kind of society we can actually build post-COVID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811592">I do that from my background as a financial administrator. As members know, I started out my adult working life as a factory worker and eventually was able to save up enough money to go back to school and learn about finances and financial management. I was able, fortunately, to use that in a variety of social enterprises and organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811593">The one thing I learned that is fundamental, when we talk about financial administration, is that we have to follow the money to see what the priorities of a social enterprise, business or organization are. What the priorities are is often dictated by where the flow of money goes. In this debate and this discussion around the main estimates and where we are as a country, it is fundamentally important to ask the question “Where is the money flowing to?” That is why this main estimates process and this debate tonight are so fundamentally important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811594">As members well know, in our corner of the House, and this dates back to the time of Tommy Douglas, within the NDP we have always believed that it is fundamentally important to make sure that those who are the wealthiest in society pay their fair share. Tommy Douglas was able to, in the first democratic socialist government in North America, actually put in place universal health care. He was able to do that because he put in place a fair tax system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811595">We can look at the NDP governments since that time. I am certainly not telling tales out of school. As members are well aware, the federal ministry of finance is not a hotbed of New Democrats. However, the federal ministries of finance have consistently, over the last decades, acknowledged that NDP governments have been the best in terms of balancing budgets and providing services for people. That is the same approach that we will take, one day, to provide the type of stewardship that we believe is fundamental to renewing our country, providing the supports, and building a society where everyone matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811596">Let us look at where the current government stands, in terms of that flow of money. Prior to the budget, we put forward, and it should have been reflected in the estimates process, a variety of smart ideas that other countries have already incorporated as we go through this pandemic. We believe that we should be putting into place, as other countries have done, a wealth tax. We should be saying to the billionaires and the ultrarich of this country that they have to pay their fair share. They benefited from this pandemic and their wealth has increased, and now they have to give some of that back, to make sure that we all have the wherewithal to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811597">We also proposed a pandemic profits tax, because we have seen in previous crises, like the Second World War, that putting that type of practice into place ensures that companies maintain the same profit levels but are not profiting unduly from the suffering that so many people have experienced through COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="05">(2005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811598">We have also been foremost with regard to cracking down on overseas tax havens. As members know, I have spoken out about this. The member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, our national leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252837" Type="2">Hamilton Centre</Affiliation> and the rest of the NDP caucus have been vociferous in this regard because these lose an astounding amount of taxpayers' money every year. They are the result of both Conservative actions and Liberal actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811599">The Parliamentary Budget Officer pointed out two years ago that Canadians lose $25 billion every year to overseas tax havens. That $25 billion could meet an enormous amount of need. It could serve in job creation or the transition to a clean energy economy. All of those things could be accomplished, but what we see is an intricate network of tax havens that has built up over the years because of both Conservative and Liberal government decisions. The cost to Canadians is profoundly strong when we think of $25 billion a year in taxpayers' money being lost to overseas tax havens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811600">When we couple that $25 billion with a pandemic profits tax, which the Parliamentary Budget Officer evaluated at $8 billion, and a wealth tax, which would bring in $10 billion a year, we start to see what financial underpinnings could be put into place to actually meet the needs of Canadians across the country. We often see that there is a flow of money to the ultrarich: the wealthiest banks and billionaires in this country. At the same time, we often see that those who have the most critical needs do not even get a trickle of that financial flow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811601">At the beginning of this crisis, where did the government decide to flow its money? We know this now. This is no secret. In fact, the Liberal government seems to be proud of this fact. Within four days of the pandemic hitting in Canada, an astounding, unbelievable, record amount of $750 billion was made available in liquidity supports to Canada's big banks through a variety of mechanisms and federal institutions: OSFI, the CMHC and the Bank of Canada. That is $750 billion. It is unparalleled in our history and unprecedented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811602">If we go back to the Harper government, there were criticisms at that time because during the global financial crisis $116 billion in liquidity support was provided to the banking sector. Of course the banking sector prospered enormously from it, but $750 billion is so difficult to get our minds around. It is a vast amount of money. It is a colossal flow of an unprecedented amount of cash in liquidity supports to the banking sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811603">The banks have responded accordingly. There were no conditions attached. They jacked up their service fees, as so many Canadians know. They did not reduce their interest rates to zero, as we saw in the credit union movement. Credit unions, such as Community Savings Credit Union in Vancouver, reduced their line of credit interest to zero and their credit card rates to zero because they knew Canadians were suffering. Canadians had to struggle to put food on the table, and the credit union sector in many respects responded to that, but the banking sector did not. It just kept seeing that money roll in. During the pandemic, its profits have been $60 billion so far. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811604">I pointed out earlier that there is no pandemic profits tax and there is no wealth tax. Canada's billionaires have increased their wealth during this pandemic by an astounding $80 billion, yet there are no measures for any sort of fairness or to make sure the ultrarich pay their fair share. We can follow the money and see, with the Liberal government, that as we went through an unprecedented crisis its first and foremost thought was for the banks and billionaires of this country. This is unique in the responses of governments through crises in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811605">During the Second World War when we needed to win the battle against Nazism and fascism, the federal government put into place an excess profits tax and wealth taxes to ensure that we had the wherewithal to win the war effort. After the Second World War, we were able to build an unprecedented amount of public housing, hospitals and educational institutions across the country and to build the transportation sector. The country boomed in so many respects because the investments were there starting with a fair tax system, but not this time. There is no wealth tax, no pandemic profits tax and no cracking down on overseas tax havens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811606">What did the NDP do? We hear rumours that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> desperately wants to call an election, and we will all be asked what we did during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811607">Under the leadership of the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, the NDP went to work immediately. We saw the huge amounts of money that were made available to the banking sector right off the bat, and we started pushing for an emergency response benefit that could lift people above the poverty line. We forced and pushed because we had seen from the best examples of other countries that we needed to put in a place a 75% wage subsidy. We pushed hard, as members know, to make that a reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811608">The track record is very clear. We pushed in the House of Commons for supports for students, seniors and people with disabilities, with the big caveat that the Liberal government never put in place wholesale supports for all people with disabilities. It has now asked them to wait three years before there is any hope of support. People with disabilities will have to wait three years while banks had to wait four days in the midst of a pandemic. That is the national tragedy we see with the flow of money going to the ultrarich, the wealthiest, to make sure that banks and billionaires benefit first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811609">New Democrats fought those fights and won many of them over the course of the past year. I know that has made a difference. We still see suffering. We still see people lining up at food banks in unprecedented numbers. Tragically we still see people with disabilities who are barely getting by. Tragically we still see people closing, for the last time, the doors of businesses that they may have devoted their lives to building up. These are community businesses that served the public and created jobs in communities across this country, but in so many cases those small businesses have had to close their doors. Nothing could be more tragic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811610">As we come out of such a profound crisis, we see many people being left behind; however, the government has put forward a budget that slashes the CERB benefits even more. The CRB was slashed from $500 a week to $300 a week, which is below the poverty level. We see the government responding to the economic crisis of seniors by saying that those over 75 get a top-up on their OAS to lift them up to the poverty line, but those under 75 are out of luck with the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811611">That contrasts vividly with the government paying out money through the wage subsidy to profitable companies that then paid huge executive bonuses or often paid dividends to their investors. The government says that is okay, despite the NDP's warnings from the very beginning that it had to put measures into place. It is not a problem: It will recover money elsewhere, but then it slashes the CERB benefits for people who need them the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811612">What does this mean, in terms of an estimates process, and how would the NDP approach the issue of making sure we meet the needs of Canadians and respond to the crisis that so many people are living through in this country? As I have already mentioned, New Democrats would tackle it from the revenue side. We would make sure that the ultrarich pay their fair share. We would crack down on overseas tax havens. The government never introduced a single piece of legislation that adequately responded to the crisis in financing we see with the hemorrhaging of $25 billion a year to overseas tax havens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811613">The CRA was before the finance committee last week. The year before, I asked who had been prosecuted in the Panama papers, the Bahama papers, the Paradise papers and the Isle of Man scam. A year ago, CRA was forced to say it had never prosecuted anybody. This year I asked the same question, and the result was exactly the same. No company and no individual has ever been prosecuted. We have thousands of names of people who have been using these particular strategies to not pay taxes, yet the CRA has never had the tools in place to take them on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811614">New Democrats would make sure that everyone pays their fair share, that the ultrarich actually pay their fair share, that billionaires do not get off scot free and that the companies that try to take their earnings overseas have to pay income tax and corporate tax. We would make sure of that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811615">What would we do in the estimates? What would an NDP estimates process look like? We have already seen signs of that over the past year. We have been tabling legislation, bringing forward bills and making sure that we actually put into place the programs Canadians need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811616">Members will recall I tabled Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>, the Canada pharmacare act, ably supported by my colleagues for <Affiliation DbId="252984" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="252890" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>. We brought that to a vote with the support of 100,000 Canadians who had written to their members of Parliament. Liberals and Conservatives voted that down, even though we know pharmacare is something that will make a huge difference in the quality of life for Canadians. It is estimated that 10 million Canadians cannot pay for their medication. Hundreds die every year because they cannot afford their medication. For thousands of others, families are forced to choose between putting food on the table and paying for their medication. We can end that suffering. At the same time the Parliamentary Budget Officer, that independent officer of Parliament who can tell us with such accuracy what the net impacts of policies are, has told us we would save about $4 billion overall as a people. We would be able to reduce the costs of medications, so the estimates process would include universal public pharmacare in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811617">As we saw with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252482" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> just last night, we would be bringing in dental care for all those who do not have access to dental care. Why is that important? We heard yesterday about a person in Sioux Lookout, Ontario, who passed away because they did not have the financial ability to pay for the dental work that was vitally important for them to be able to eat. These are tragedies that are repeated so often in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811618">What else would we see in the estimates? The guaranteed livable basic income was brought to the House of Commons by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253019" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>. We have seen how so many members of our caucus have fought for the rights of indigenous peoples. It should be a source of shame for the government that dozens of indigenous communities still do not have safe drinking water, six years after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> said in response to a question from a journalist, how would we ever accept the cities of Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal not having safe drinking water? It is simply astounding, yet we have no wealth tax or pandemic profit tax in place. We have no set of priorities that allows us to ensure that all communities in this country have safe drinking water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811619">We saw the incredible tragedy of the genocide in residential schools. There are first nations communities that do not have the funding to find their missing, murdered, dead and disappeared children. This has to be a national priority as part of reconciliation. It cannot simply be pretty words. We have to act, and that means ensuring that when we say “follow the money”, it is no longer the very wealthy or ultrarich who receive the vast majority of federal funds, but the people across this country, indigenous peoples, who get the supports that they need and the quality of life they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811620">There is the issue of the right to housing. Again, it would be part of our estimates to ensure that all Canadians have roofs over their heads at night. This is not rocket science. It takes investment. Other countries have had the right to housing instilled. In a country with a climate as cold as Canada's, housing should be a fundamental right of every Canadian. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811621">We would provide supports to peoples with disabilities, students and seniors. People have been struggling through this pandemic, yet students are still paying their student loans, seniors are being denied the increased OAS if they are under age 75 and people with disabilities are being asked to wait three years. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants to pump $20 billion into the TMX pipeline instead of investing in clean energy that would result in hundreds of thousands of new jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811622">The estimates process with an NDP government would be different and better. We will continue to fight for a country where no one is left behind.</ParaText>

In fact, the member might recall that back in 2011 that was a major part of what the NDP put forward. Canadians could invest in that transition to clean energy, the green new deal, ensuring hundreds of thousands of jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811627">The building trades estimate that over the next four decades up to three million new jobs will come from investments in clean energy and the clean energy economy, so the green bonds issue was the inspiration. The social bonds are something that is much smaller in scope and scale.</ParaText>

I wonder if he can update the House on what he has done on this issue, and what the response has been from the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811645">The member points out that so many people are concerned about this dramatic cut the Liberal government wants to bring in. Five hundred dollars a week is certainly not a sinecure. Five hundred dollars a week is just getting by. It is making sure they have a roof over their head, hopefully, and food on the table. Slashing it to below the poverty line at a time when Canadians desperately need it is simply the most mean-spirited cut that one could possibly imagine at this time.</ParaText>

The government should roll back on that and ensure that Canadians can get through the pandemic. We will continue to fight to make that so.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6811652">Mr. Speaker, on June 9, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252807" Type="2">Calgary Midnapore</Affiliation> submitted a notice of opposition regarding Vote 1, “Operating expenditures”, in the main estimates, under Department of Transport, in the amount of $741,693,237.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811653">The notice of opposition calls on Nav Canada executives and managers to pay back $7 million in bonuses they received in the last fiscal year, supposedly during the pandemic, while the private not-for-profit organization was receiving government assistance and issuing layoff notices. To protest those bonuses, the member is suggesting that $7 million be cut from the Transport Canada budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811654">Let me begin my remarks by discussing what such a cut would mean for Transport Canada's programs and, by extension, for Canadians. A $7‑million reduction to Transport Canada's main estimates funding for 2021-22 would significantly reduce its ability to deliver on its commitments. This reduction would have undesirable consequences, such as weakening the implementation of monitoring, testing, inspection and subsidy programs across all modes of transportation, including air, marine, rail and road. It would also result in reduced enforcement activities that could increase the potential risk to the safety and security of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811655">Furthermore, reduced surveillance of equipment, operations and facilities in the transportation industry could lead to accidents, malfunctions and loss of life. It would also have a negative impact on the department's efforts to support the economic recovery of the air sector and other transportation sectors affected by the pandemic. This reduction would set a precedent for departments to pay for organizations that operate at arm's length from the Government of Canada.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811656">Allow me, for greater emphasis, to reiterate some of these points in English.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811657">The impact of a $7-million reduction to Transport Canada's 2021 main estimates funding would significantly reduce its ability to deliver on its commitments. Undesirable consequences could include reduced levels of inspections across all transportation modes: air, land and marine. It could include reduced enforcement activities and reduced surveillance of the transportation industry's equipment, operations and facilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811658">How would these cuts impact ordinary Canadians? I will give some examples. Transport Canada recently announced the funding of $7 million in Lethbridge for the rehabilitation of runways, $5 million through the national trade corridors fund to improve the efficiency of rail logistics in Alberta's industrial heartland; $2 million to the remote air services program to British Columbia to ensure essential air services to remote communities in the province; a combined $8 million to the communities of Smithers and Terrace in the riding of Skeena—Bulkley Valley to rehabilitate airport infrastructure; and $11 million to the community of Mont-Joli in the electoral district of Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia to rehabilitate the airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811659">Which of these projects would the opposition cancel in order to recuperate the $7 million it is purporting to cut? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811660">The cuts also negatively impact the department's efforts to support the economic recovery of the air sector, as well as other transportation sectors affected by the pandemic. It would also set a precedent for government departments to pay for organizations that are operating at arm's length from the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811661">In short, this would be a very unwise way to protest Nav Canada's financial decision, which again has nothing to do with the supply vote in front of us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6811662">I would like to say a few words about Nav Canada. Nav Canada is a private, not-for-profit corporation tasked with managing Canada's air navigation services. This model was introduced for the first time in 1996 to replace the air navigation services that were previously provided by Transport Canada. All subsequent governments kept that model in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811663"> Nav Canada oversees air traffic in Canada through a sophisticated network of area control centres, air traffic control towers, flight service stations, maintenance centres, flight information centres and navigation aids across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811664">Its customers include airlines, business aviation and air cargo operators, air charters and air taxis, helicopter operators and general aviation pilots and owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811665">Nav Canada is independent from the Government of Canada because it does not report to the Minister of Transport or Parliament. Nav Canada is not part of the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>'s main estimates. As a result, it is not included in Transport Canada's Vote 1 estimates of $741,693,237 for 2021-22. What is more, Nav Canada's financial statements are not included in the Government of Canada's main estimates process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811666"> As a not-for-profit corporation, Nav Canada invests directly in its operations, people and infrastructure to keep Canada's air navigation system as safe, efficient and innovative as it can be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811667">Nav Canada's governance structure is composed of federal government representatives, users and unionized employees. In turn, these representatives select the members of Nav Canada's board of directors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811668">Now I will turn to the bonuses paid out to Nav Canada executives. Nav Canada bonuses are paid to senior executives and exempt staff, who are managers. Bonuses are usually between 5% and 20% of an employee's total compensation. They are accounted for in Nav Canada's vision, which is to pay wages equivalent to the market average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811669">Bonuses are normally paid to about 550 employees, but they are not distributed evenly. The average amount paid out from that $7 million would be $13,000, but the amount varies from one person to the next. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811670">Recent media reports stated that Nav Canada was planning to issue layoff notices to 49 employees. Those notices have since been rescinded. Nav Canada chose not to publicize its senior executives' compensation because of its policies stating that disagreements with the unions are not resolved immediately. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811671">Now I would like to talk about Nav Canada's independence from Transport Canada. Once again, there is no connection between the payment of Nav Canada bonuses and Vote 1 of the main estimates for Transport Canada in the amount of $741,693,237. Nav Canada receives no direct funding from Transport Canada and is not accountable to either the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> or Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811672">Nav Canada is primarily funded by the fees it receives for managing more than 18 million square kilometres of airspace. Additional revenue is generated through technology sales and other related business activities. The company operates with a break-even business model, balancing costs and revenues by borrowing to meet cash flow requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811673">I want to make a few points about the $7 million in bonuses paid by Nav Canada while the company was receiving government assistance and issuing layoff notices. The bonuses reported in the news were paid for the first half of the company's fiscal year, from September 2019 to February 2020, before the industry suffered significant negative impacts from COVID‑19. Budget 2021 proposed requiring that publicly listed corporations repay the wage subsidy for any qualifying period after June 5, 2021. The Nav Canada bonuses were paid outside of the period set out in budget 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811674">In response to COVID‑19, Nav Canada executives agreed to significant reductions to salary and benefits, and there is no immediate plan to restore them before the airline industry recovers. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811675">Note that salaries were reduced by 3% to 5%. Pensions were restructured and became less generous. The annual salary review for senior executives to reconsider possible raises was cancelled. The management team was also cut in half and, during that time, the company issued layoff notices to 49 employees. As I was saying earlier, these notices were rescinded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811676">Like other Canadian companies, the employees at Nav Canada can receive wage subsidies through the Canada emergency wage subsidy, or CEWS. Nav Canada noted that its employees had benefited from the CEWS and that the company had not received the large employer emergency financing facility, or LEEFF, nor had it received any special financing under favourable terms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811677">As far as the rule around the wage subsidy is concerned, budget 2021 stated that the wage subsidy should be paid back in certain cases where senior executives' compensation increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811678">Budget 2021 proposes to require a publicly listed corporation to repay wage subsidy amounts received for a qualifying period that begins after June 5, 2021, in the event that its aggregate compensation for specified executives during the 2021 calendar year exceeds its aggregate compensation for specified executives during the 2019 calendar year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811679">For the purpose of this rule, a publicly listed corporation's specified executives will be its named executive officers whose compensation is required to be disclosed under Canadian securities law in its statement of executive compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811680">This generally includes its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and three other most highly compensated executives. A corporation's executive compensation for a calendar year will be calculated by prorating the aggregate compensation of its specified executives for each of its taxation years that overlap with the calendar year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811681">The amount of the wage subsidy required to be repaid would be equal to the lesser of the following: the total of all wage subsidy amounts received in respect of active employees for qualifying periods that begin after June 5, 2021, and the amount by which the corporation's aggregate specified executives' compensation for 2021 exceeds its aggregate specified executives' compensation for 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811682">This requirement to repay would be applied at the group level and would apply to wage subsidy amounts paid to any entity in the group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811683">I hope that my remarks have clarified some of the questions about the bonuses paid to Nav Canada executives. I think that what should be quite clear is that the proposed $7‑million reduction to Transport Canada's operating budget is an ill-advised and irresponsible way to protest these bonuses. The funds used to pay these bonuses did not come from Transport Canada's budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811684">Furthermore, the cuts would hurt Transport Canada's ability to carry out its mandate. As I mentioned earlier, this would weaken the implementation of monitoring, testing, inspection and subsidy programs across all modes of transportation. It would also result in reduced enforcement activities that could increase the potential risk to the safety and security of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811685">In addition, reduced surveillance of the transportation industry's equipment, operations and facilities could result in accidents, malfunctions and, of course, loss of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811686">I will give the member who proposed these cuts the benefit of the doubt and assume that she did not consider some of their potential consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811687">It is very easy to fan the flames of anger about executive compensation, and in some cases, this is often completely justified. However, as legislators, we must also act responsibly when making decisions and ensure that we do not inadvertently hurt Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811688">I urge all members to vote in favour of Vote 1, “Operating expenditures”, in the main estimates, under Department of Transport, in the amount of $741,693,237.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811722">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure tonight to rise in the House to speak to the main estimates for the Department of Transport. I note that I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252944" Type="2">Regina—Wascana</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811723">Since the beginning of the current session of Parliament, it has been my pleasure to sit on the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. This committee is filled with a good group of parliamentarians working to get answers for Canadians on transport-related issues and to secure the future of transport in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811724">This past fall, we began a study to examine the impacts of COVID-19 on the aviation sector in Canada. We heard heart-wrenching stories from many witnesses about how much of their workforce had to be laid off. Many were struggling to put food on the table in cases where there were gaps in federal support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811725">What is interesting to note is that, while some companies were getting little to no support and could not secure a meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, other companies were receiving much more support and getting meetings with the minister on a regular basis. The patchwork approach the government has been taking when it comes to getting support to Canada's aviation sector ignores all the workers in the aviation sector who have lost their jobs as a result of the government's inaction on this file. Canadians have been watching closely over the past year, and many in this sector still have not received the support they require. Hope is dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811726">It is nice for aviation workers to hear from the government that help is on the way, but when is it coming? When days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months and then months turn into over a year, I can see why so many in the industry who have still not received support have lost hope. However, members should note that not all airlines are still waiting for support. Air Canada received a $5-billion package from the government in April, and shortly after, it awarded more than $10 million in bonuses to executives and managers. The Conservatives have been clear from the beginning: We must get support out the door to those who need it most, and no taxpayer money should ever be used for executive bonuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811727">A couple of weeks ago, I heard from a constituent who, prior to COVID, booked a vacation for himself and his wife for their 30th anniversary. Because of travel restrictions, their vacation was put on hold and they received a travel voucher that was good for 24 months. This was all good until my constituent lost his job because of COVID and needed to access the funds that were tied up in a vacation that he and his wife never got to go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811728">Many travel companies have said that passenger refunds are tied to government support. Sunwing received a temporary support package back in February and set aside money for customers, but it has not dispensed that money, as it is still in negotiations with the government regarding its full support package.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811729">The predicament this constituent and many other Canadians in similar situations now find themselves in is that they still have no clear indications from the government about when travel restrictions will be lifted, and the end of the 24-month period for the travel voucher is coming quickly. If the government does not soon finalize the support package, customers in this situation are at risk of losing the thousands of dollars they saved for a vacation that they may never get to go on. This is just one story of how the government's inaction on this issue is costing Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811730">On the border, as I mentioned, the government has still not provided Canadians with any sort of indication as to when the border might open. The government waited far too long to close the border. Now we are nearing the end of the pandemic, and it refuses to provide Canadians with certainty as to when we will reopen it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811731">I would like to thank all those who work at the CBSA and have been challenged over the past year to quickly adapt to the ever-changing rules and travel restrictions thrown at them. COVID began in March 2020, and we knew very early on that COVID was entering Canada because we left our borders open and the government repeatedly failed to take meaningful action to secure them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811732">The spending that is occurring in the transport budget is important, and I agree that we must provide support to the industries that were hardest hit by COVID. However, with the government, we repeatedly see money being allocated in the budget and then either not getting out the door fast enough, like all of the lapsed infrastructure spending, or getting out the door and into the wrong hands, like with the WE Charity scandal and Air Canada's executive compensation package.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811733">An area that needs support is the tourism industry. When I talk about targeted support being needed, an area that comes to mind with a shortfall is tourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811734">COVID-19 has been incredibly tough on the tourism industry. I talk with many stakeholders in my riding, and a concern I hear from them is that, while the $500 million in support the government is offering is appreciated, when stretched to companies from coast to coast to coast, this support is being spread too thin. Businesses have suffered major losses through no fault of their own. The support they need should be available to continue their operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811735">It is extremely important that we fully recover the tourism industry, especially in communities that rely on the industry as a significant part of their economy. A factor we need to think about in relation to tourism recovery is the transportation of people and how easy it is for tourists to get to their destinations. In many cases, taking a bus over a flight or driving can make for a more economical vacation. With the closing of Greyhound Canada, this is leaving a gap in our transportation network. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811736">Many Canadians across Canada who live in rural or more remote regions depend on intercity bus services to travel large distances between smaller towns and urban areas. As Greyhound continues to operate in the United States, we must recognize that the decision to close down operations in Canada will have a ripple effect on our tourism industry and will result in consumers having less choice in how they reach their vacation destinations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811737">Our transportation sector is of vital importance for the tens of thousands of Canadians employed in the sector. These are real people who need support and must not be treated as political pawns. For nearly a year, the government has been promising them support but repeatedly failing to deliver in a meaningful way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811738">To conclude, my Conservative colleagues and I are calling on the government to deliver support to our aviation sector. That means restoring Canada's regional routes, ensuring passengers receive refunds, making sure travel agent commissions are not clawed back, ensuring Nav Canada maintains adequate service levels for air traffic controls and bringing forward a comprehensive travel restart plan so that Canadians are no longer left in the dark.</ParaText>

Since we cannot properly distance in a lot of tourism opportunities, we cannot have proper engagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811745"> That is where the government needs to either secure loans or create a compensation package in order to make these businesses viable once again. That is the challenge that the Liberals are not responding to for Canadian businesses. Small businesses such as those in the tourism industry are going to suffer greatly without this compensation package.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811753">I have the privilege of serving on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities with an outstanding group of MPs from all parties. Over the course of the past several months, the committee had the opportunity to hear from many representatives from the country's air travel sector. Yesterday the committee presented to the House its report, entitled “Emerging from the Crisis: A Study of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Air Transport Sector”. However, the committee witnesses were unanimous in their bleak assessment of the effects of the pandemic on air travel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811754">Few sectors have been hit harder by the pandemic than the air travel sector. Airlines, airports, independent travel advisers, air traffic controllers and small business owners who run the souvenir shops at the airports have all experienced job losses, cutbacks and hardship. However, unlike many sectors, restarting the air travel sector will not be like turning on a light switch. The air travel sector has faced many unique challenges during the pandemic, the effects of which will be felt for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811755">For this evening's debate, I will focus my remarks on the difficult situation in which Canada's airports find themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811756">The air travel sector cannot function without financially viable airports. After all, the airplanes have to have some place to land and some place to take off from. When most of this country's airports were privatized in the 1990s, a fee structure was established with the airlines that was based on air traffic volumes. This country's airports could rely on a steady stream of revenues as long as there was also a steady stream of commercial airline flights. All of that came to a halt in the spring of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811757">In my home city of Regina, the Regina International Airport went 10 days at the beginning of the pandemic without a single commercial passenger flight. For much of the pandemic, air travel levels were down as much as 90% compared to pre-pandemic levels. This lack of air travel means a lack of revenue for this country's airports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811758">As a result, airports had to lay off staff and dip into cash reserves. When the cash reserves ran out, they had to go to the bank and borrow. Today, this country's airports have debt loads that they have never seen before. How will they pay off this debt? It will be by passing the cost on to consumers as air travel resumes after the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811759">Now, some people may shrug their shoulders and say “So what? Airport debts and debt servicing fees get passed on to air travellers; that is life.” Maybe it would not be such a big deal if Canada were a closed country that lived in isolation, but we are not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811760">Air travel policies of the American government are bound to affect Canada and the rest of the world as well. It is worth noting that within weeks of the start of the pandemic, the U.S. Congress passed the CARES Act to provide $10 billion in financial relief to American airports. This means that American airports have had financial certainty throughout the pandemic and have not had to go deep into debt. It means that American airports will not have the financial burden of debt and debt servicing costs to pass on to their customers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811761">Even before the pandemic, flying out of a Canadian airport was significantly more expensive than flying out of an American one. This is because, historically, American governments have viewed airports as an infrastructure investment, while in Canada, most airports operate on Crown land and serve as a source of revenue for the federal government through ground lease payments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811762">As Canadian airports take on more and more debt and pass more and more debt and debt servicing costs on to passengers, American airports become relatively less expensive by comparison. This poses a real long-term problem for Canadian airports, especially those that are located within driving distance of the U.S. border. The Bellingham airport in the state of Washington is just a short drive across the border from Vancouver. The Niagara Falls airport is on the American side of the border, just a short drive down the highway from Hamilton and St. Catharines. The airport in Plattsburgh, New York, already advertises itself as “Montréal's U.S. Airport”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="15">(2115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811763">All along the Canada-U.S. border, the story is the same. American airports will become more attractive options as Canadian airports struggle to find ways to pass their crippling debt loads on to Canadian travellers. These debt loads will have a ripple effect across the air travel sector as Canadian airlines, independent travel advisers and hotels lose business across the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811764">What could the government do to help this country's struggling airports? I would say one thing the air travel sector really needs right now is a safe reopening plan. The quicker we could get Canadians flying again, the quicker airline and airport revenues will rebound, and all of the harmful effects of the pandemic that I have described could be minimized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811765">However, the biggest challenge facing the air travel sector is a lack of customers, caused by uncertainty in the marketplace. The pandemic has thrown many sectors of the economy into chaos, including restaurants, movie theatres and clothing stores. Most businesses are primarily governed by their provincial governments, and most provincial governments have already spelled out a safe reopening plan based on vaccination levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811766"> For example, in my home province of Saskatchewan, in just three more days restaurants will no longer have to limit the number of customers seated at a single table, although customers will only be able to order à la carte and buffets are not allowed yet. Just think of how much easier it will be for restaurant workers and owners and their customers to plan a major dinner party when there is a clearly spelled out reopening plan for restaurants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811767"> Now, imagine if the federal government were to do the same thing for air travel. I am sure that after well over a year of this pandemic, many Canadians would really like to start making their summer travel plans. Airlines, travel advisers, tour operators and hotels would all like to start making bookings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811768">What are the rules? More importantly, what will the rules be next week and next month and in the coming months as vaccination levels continue to inch upwards?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811769">If someone who is fully vaccinated flies down to the States and then flies back, how much longer will that person still have to go through the mandatory 14-day quarantine? How much longer will that person still have to go to the quarantine hotels? What about someone who is only partially vaccinated? What about a husband and wife who are fully vaccinated but whose children are too young to receive the vaccine? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811770">That is just for international travel. What about travelling within Canada? Are we going to see a patchwork of different rules within Canada, whereby some provinces require quarantines and others do not? Will it be easier for Canadians to fly to the United States for their summer holidays than to other provinces within Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811771">These are all very reasonable and practical questions that Canadians are starting to ask. The absence of any answers and the absence of any safe reopening plan from the federal government is putting another summer travel season in jeopardy. The loss of another summer travel season would cause undue harm, not only to this country's airports but to our airlines, independent travel advisers, air traffic controllers, tour operators and so many Canadians who depend on a properly functioning air transport sector.</ParaText>

What the federal government should do is follow the lead of many provincial governments, which is to come up with a minimum level of vaccinations that would make a safe reopening plan reasonable. Then it could look at the calendar and say, based on the current levels and rates of vaccination, what a reasonable time frame to achieve those goals would be so Canadians could start making their summer travel plans, so they could be working again and getting life back to normal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811791">Madam Speaker, I am speaking from the traditional territory of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation and the Ta'an Kwach'an Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811792">I want to talk about the background to the estimates and the budget, and the fall economic statement that provides the background that the budget is supporting, that the estimates will be supporting. I will talk about transportation and a number of other items. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811793">The biggest emphasis in the budget is to finish the fight against COVID, and there is a large contribution to the provinces and territories for that. It is still not over and that is very essential. There is support for individuals and businesses to get through this economic fallout. We are on the road of recovery, but as a number of interventions have shown, in the tourism industry, for instance, there is still a lot of time before everyone is fully recovered, so we need to keep those supports going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811794">The third big objective is for the economy to come roaring back in a way that includes everyone, with special supports, for instance, for women and for indigenous businesses. We want the economy to come back with a green economy, which has so much potential for jobs. We want an economy that will come back in a competitive way, where we can compete internationally, that creates a lot of new jobs, particularly for youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811795">People who have experienced not having a job at some point in their lives, and they have to support a family, feel a big pit in their stomachs. There are very few things that can be so scary, upsetting and devastating. Although it was a very large investment, as many people have said, a huge investment, it was very essential to keep people working through these difficult times. That was obviously a big objective and the parties co-operated in a very good way to achieve it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811796">Based on the questions of some members, they may not have been aware that there were 861,000 CEBA loans for over $46 billion. There were 5.3 million jobs saved with the wage subsidy of $73 billion. Our first rent assistance program saw 140,000 applications approved and 1.25 million employees were assisted with $2 billion. The second rent assistance was worth $2.5 billion and helped over 150,000 applicants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811797">Even with all these programs, there may have been people who fell through the cracks. As everyone knows, these programs had to be created very quickly if we were going to help people from going under. There may have been cracks that were not filled, so the regional relief and recovery fund was put into the regional development agencies across Canada, with the tremendous leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="253380" Type="4">Minister of Economic Development</Affiliation>. A few fell through the cracks, but that fund helped over 23,000 applicants across the country, with $1.4 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811798"> Tourism is important to me, and out of those amounts of money, tourism alone had over 4,400 approvals for $392 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811799">A lot of these supports were so critical to keep jobs during these unprecedented times not seen since the war. The fall economic statement added to that. For tourism, there is the HASCAP program. The RRRF I just mentioned was so needed and efficient that we had to increase money for it. Then there was the regional air transport fund, which is so important in rural Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811800">One of the most exciting things was the announcement of the new regional economic development agency for British Columbia. British Columbia is a unique area and there will be all kinds of special supports, recognizing that uniqueness, with this new agency. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811801">Of course, that leaves the prairie regional development agency on its own with all those previous funds, which it can now enhance even more its work, over and above all the projects that went there through the RRRF already. This will be great for the Prairies, and they can lead the way for us in resource projects. Their human resources are very bright, great research done is done in the prairie areas, and all kinds of businesses can lead with exports and help the recovery in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811802">I want to talk about some of the things that are really essential for the north. First, I am most excited about the increase in the northern residents deduction for the Territories and the northern parts of the provinces. A lot of people were not eligible for this deduction. People could only claim it if their employer put it on their T4 slip, gave them a travel allowance and then they could collect this northern residents travel reduction. However, this budget has allowed for everyone to have access that deduction. They do not need their employer to include it on their T4 slips. That will be so exciting for the economies of the north, and for the people of the north as a personal support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811803">Our biggest employer and hardest hit one is tourism. There is a record amount of additional funds specific to tourism in the budget, $1 billion, of which $200 million is for local festivals, cultural events, heritage celebrations, local museums and amateur sports events. In my riding, we have all those things in great numbers and, of course, they greatly contribute to employment and to our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811804">There are another $200 million for the major events in those areas, such as festivals, cultural events, heritage, local museums and amateur sports events. That does not affect my riding so much, but in the big cities of the country, that will be critical for those activities to carry on, to provide employment and to keep jobs. For decades, I think parliamentarians have underestimated the cultural sector and its importance to the creation of jobs and to moving forward our cultural ideas and thought processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811805">There are also $100 million for Destination Canada. Canada has not put as much into marketing our great nation as some other countries of the world. It is something I have always advocated for, and I am so excited to see that funding for Destination Canada, again to help our tourism industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811806">Then we have the $500 million tourism relief fund, once again, recognizing the tourism industry and how hard it has been hit. Our borders are open to all the other businesses. Trucks can come across. The one thing the border is not open to during the pandemic is tourism. On top of all that for tourism, is a $700 million for small business financing fund. It will not all go to tourism businesses, but again, it provides more support for small businesses to particularly help them in the green area, to be inclusive, to be competitive and to create more jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811807">In the north, our two biggest sectors are mining and tourism. In my riding, the mining sector's first request was support for hydroelectric power. We are running out of power in the north. Therefore, the budget includes $40.4 million to study and prepare potential hydroelectric projects across the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811808">The Yukon government is one of the most progressive in the country with its climate change plan and reducing greenhouse gas plan, and it wanted some assistance, so the budget has included $25 million for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811809">As a Conservative member mentioned earlier this evening, and I believe it was the member for <Affiliation DbId="253017" Type="2">Niagara Falls</Affiliation>, tourism will not be back right away. It will take some time, yet our rent subsidy and our wage subsidy are running out this month. Therefore, unless we get the budget implementation act passed, there is going to be a lot of difficulty in the tourism sector, both for businesses and for NGOs that need the wage subsidy and the rent subsidy, which this budget implementation act, Bill <Document DbId="11283337" Type="3">C-30,</Document> would extend into the fall.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811810">Another item that is very important for us and that probably has not been mentioned much is the centre of excellence for critical minerals. Critical minerals are needed a lot for batteries, for one thing, so they are absolutely essential, first for the mining industry and to have a clean environment to deal with the climate change crisis. As members know, one country in particular is trying to corner the market on critical metals, and we have an agreement with the United States. It is very important for us, for various reasons, so I am very excited to see that in the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811811">In past budgets, there has not been so much for communities, but communities were hit hard by this. Their various types of support were also reduced during the pandemic. I was delighted to see a Canada community revitalization fund, something brand new. There is $500 million there so the small communities across the country can have projects that are very important to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811812">There are a number of supports for seniors. During our term, we increased the GIS for the lowest-income seniors, and there are several other supports for seniors during COVID. There is a huge increase to the new horizons for seniors program, and there is an addition in the budget of 10% for seniors over 75 to add to all that, for the most needy seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811813">Then there is a very large Canada digital adoption program. As members know, we are in the 21st century, the digital economy. It is a lot of learning for me, but if we are going to keep up with the rest of the world, our businesses have to keep up, so it is great to have that fund to help businesses transform over. There are a lot of jobs for young people in there as mentors to help the businesses transfer into the digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811814">There is also the Canada recovery hiring program. As I mentioned, one of the big objectives is to hire more people, to get people back to work. If businesses had to lay people off, reduce their hours or reduce their wages, all those things can be supplemented from June 6 to November 20 through the Canada recovery hiring program. The very flexible idea is that for each month or each eligibility period for this program and for the wage subsidy, they can pick whichever one is best for their company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811815">I do not have time to talk about it now, but there are a number of improvements to small-business financing. Certainly there are significant investments in first nations. People will remember back to the biggest investment in history of $5 billion, proposed by Paul Martin for the Kelowna Accord. Well, this budget has $18 billion for first nations and $4.3 billion for infrastructure, for instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811816">In my career, very seldom have I seen money for social financing, for NGOs and charities, but in this budget there is $200 million for a social financing fund. To get companies ready, there is an investment of $50 million in the investment readiness fund, because the first one was so successful it was all used up. There is a very unique concept being floated of social financing bonds for those who want to invest to help the country in a socially responsible way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811817">As I mentioned, communities need support, and there is a community services recovery fund to help various community services and NGOs adapt and modernize, after they have been hit so hard by COVID and so many of their resources have been decimated by COVID.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6811818">There is money for domestic vaccine production, which I think everyone appreciates. There is a huge increase, another increase, in the broadband fund, and that is very important for my riding, as well as cellphone coverage. There are 100,000 people being lifted out of poverty with the increase in the Canada workers benefit. There are huge funds for training, as I said, to get people employed again, 500,000 people, of which 215,000 are youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811819">I will mention something that probably no one else will mention, the polar continental shelf funding of $24 million. That is to help Arctic research. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811820">There is also $140 million for food security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811821">The Liard First Nation has a great housing manufacturing project that I am supporting. On self-governing first nations housing, they have great ideas. I would also like to see support for getting off-grid, remote mines off diesel, and increases for the equipment and O&amp;M for indigenous broadcasters, who do such wonderful work in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811822">I really appreciate the large investments in salmon, to enhance salmon on the west coast. They come right up into my riding. Salmon are very important for indigenous culture and ceremonies, for one thing, as well as for food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811823">There is also the doubling of the student grant for two more years and extending the waiver of interest to 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811824">I want to talk about aviation in the north for a bit. We really appreciate the northern air support that started almost from the beginning of the pandemic. It is important to know that we need interlining with the mainline carriers. We cannot let the mainline carriers put our small, local carriers out of business. We really need the mainline carriers to interline, to have co-operative arrangements where everyone wins. Neither airline has to go half-empty. The big carriers could get new customers for their overseas routes, while the local carriers that service the north could get the flights down to Edmonton, Vancouver, the big cities that are so needed for their competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811825">I could talk about a lot of other things, but I do not have time now. The Conservatives brought up that what is really important for them is a plan. We have huge plans. The fall economic statement was a 168-page plan. It had all sorts of things to return the economy. Then the budget is a 740-page plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811826">I will just mention some of the items in that plan to get companies back to work, over and above all the ones I have already mentioned. There is money for food security, indigenous and women entrepreneurs, an A1 strategy, artificial intelligence strategy, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research—again, we are in the 21st century—a quantum strategy, the Canadian Photonics Fabrication Centre, business-led R and D through the colleges, Mitacs for 85,000 placements, CanCode, the net-zero accelerator to help the resource industry, the clean-growth hub, support for Measurement Canada, strategic innovation funds, IRAP expansion, which has been so important for innovation in Canada for decades, Elevated IP, the strategic intellectual property program review, the innovation superclusters, the data in the digital world, and support for the Standards Council of Canada and the Competition Bureau.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811827">I encourage everyone to support all these items that I have mentioned, and the ones in the estimates, so that we could get Canadians back to work and businesses could keep our economy going. We would not need to continue government supports for either individuals or businesses once we get everyone back. We need to continue support for Canada and around the world. When COVID exists anywhere in the world, it is still a threat to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811828">I will leave it at that. I hope we get support from all parties, which have been very co-operative and helpful during the pandemic.</ParaText>

I know in the first round we got something like $200 million out of $2 billion, which was way more than our number per capita, although we have a lot of area where we have to put that infrastructure in, to be able to get tourists in and out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811832">The other transportation funding that has been very important and essential for us has been the support for the northern air transport. We had several projects announced recently to improve our airport, the structure, the aprons and the runways, but also for the northern airlines that have been hurt, which provide service to the rural communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811833">As I said, one thing that needs support from all members of Parliament is to have the big airlines interline with our northern airlines, so they can both still compete and they are not either putting the smaller airline out of business or costing the large airline more than it needs to—</ParaText>

The COVID supports that people in his riding and across the country received, a large percentage of them have come from the federal government. The provinces, at least in my area, have had some very innovative and helpful programs to add to this federal support. I imagine that in his riding the provincial government has added some supports to the federal supports.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811845">Madam Speaker, the Liberals' financial plan is failing to go after large corporate abusers of the wage subsidy while planning a 40% cut for the 1.5 million Canadians who are still depending on the Canada recovery benefit in order to make rent and put food on the table. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811846">New Democrats have raised this issue many times in the House, and the government's answer has been either completely ignorant or totally disingenuous. When we express skepticism about the budget, government members say, “Oh the NDP, if they vote against the budget, they are voting against an extension of the Canada recovery benefit”. Nothing could be further from the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811847"> The problem is that the Liberals refuse to admit that there is a possibility, other than terminating the benefit or cutting the benefit, which is to continue the benefit at the current rate. So, while they are content to allow corporate abusers of the wage subsidy get off scot-free, I think it is totally inappropriate for them to be going after all these Canadians who still have not been able to go back to work, who are depending on the Canada recovery benefit and who cannot afford to go from $2,000 a month down to $1,200 a month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811848">I want to know what the member has to say to that, and do not tell me that it is a choice between either terminating the benefit or cutting the benefit, because we all know that if the government had the right intention, it could extend the benefit at the current rate. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811850">First of all, I cannot agree with the premise of the member's question that abusers are being let off. All the programs have conditions, including the wage subsidy, and those are followed up. For example, the wage subsidy can only be used for wages and, as I mentioned, that is what kept a huge number of people working so that they could put food on the table. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811851">However, as the pandemic is winding down, as I mentioned during my speech, most of the supports are reducing as people come out of the pandemic, and both individual and corporate supports are going down. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811856">Madam Speaker, the fact that there is $200 million for big cultural events or festivals like Folklorama is very important. As I said, I think culture has been a bit of a forgotten sector in our economy, and so this is important for all the people who work in the sector. It is important for all of the performers in the gig economy who really have limited income, and it is so important to our spirit. As well, by having entertainment locally, we have Canadians supporting Canadians, we keep people in the country and have our dollars recirculate in the country, which is also very important.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6811858">Madam Speaker, I am happy to be here tonight to talk about transportation and tourism. These sectors are very important not just in my riding, but across the country. As for the estimates, since I do not have a lot of time, I will be pretty succinct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811859">First of all, I will talk about what is needed and then what is in the estimates and the budget. We know that because of the pandemic, all of the airlines and a number of transportation businesses have had to lay off workers and they are in a tough spot. The government needed to come up with some kind of aid package. That said, it picked winners and losers. It decided Air Canada and Air Transat were going to get bailouts, but not WestJet. Why is that? That is just not fair. We need all of them to continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811860">Greyhound has gone out of business. This is a critical service, especially for lower-income individuals and people across the country in rural and remote places. Something is needed there and there is nothing coming forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811861">One of the groups that is very concerned is travel agents. A lot of times they have consulting fees and they have not been able to take advantage of a lot of the government's programs. Something needs to be done for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811862">We need to get a border opening plan, not just with our neighbour to the south, but across the provinces, accelerating the vaccine rollout, working with the provinces and territories to open up and providing an incentive for Canadians to travel in this country. That is a huge $30-billion opportunity, a way of restoring life to the tourism sector that has been very hard hit. The $1 billion in the budget is not going to do it, so we need an additional incentive on top of that. In addition, as I have said, we need to put back in place all of the smaller routes and work on that plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6811863">When it comes to the tourism sector, a lot of the festivals and fairs were very hard hit. In my riding, there is the Brigden Fair and the Plympton-Wyoming Fair. There are fall fairs all over the place and everybody wants to get back to them, but without some kind of government infusion, they will not be able to survive. We need to do something for them. Let us get back to normal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6812007">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this House at any hour, of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812008">This evening I find myself talking about a subject that we have been discussing at great length. That is the complete disregard that Liberal members have for this place, particularly the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of his cabinet, with respect to the subject of documents ordered by the Canada-China committee and the government's refusal to follow the orders for those documents to be tabled with that committee. When they have tabled the documents, recognizing the order made by the committee, they have done so with illegal redactions of those documents. Twice the documents were ordered; twice the government failed to properly table them. The House ordered the documents to be tabled; the government failed to table them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812009">Now today, in a landmark vote in the House, the documents were again ordered, but this time the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada is to deliver them personally at the bar of the House of Commons, at which time he is to be admonished by the Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812010">It is unbelievable that we find ourselves in a position where the House has had to take this extraordinary step, but it certainly is consistent with the behaviour and the pattern of behaviour that the government has demonstrated over the last six years, and certainly in the recent months, with many hours of filibusters across multiple committees, be it the health committee, the procedure and House affairs committee, national defence or the access to information, privacy and ethics committee. There are no lengths to which the government will not go to perpetrate its cover-up, to hide the truth from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812011">In this case, we have to wonder what could be so damning in these documents that the government is refusing to comply with lawful orders of this place. There are provisions. We will hear the cries from the parliamentary secretary that national security could be at risk. That is disingenuous. We know that the parliamentary law clerk has been given the task to ensure that no breaches of national security could come to pass and would make all of the appropriate redactions to ensure that that is the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812012">Canadians deserve to know the truth, and they deserve a government that respects the will of Canadians and puts their best interests ahead of corruption and pride. We have a government that has the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and several ministers of the Crown who have been found guilty of breaking the ethics act. We have filibusters across multiple parliamentary committees, too many hours to rhyme them all off in the short time that I have, a prorogation to cover up the WE scandal, and now we have, of course, landmark findings against the government in this place today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812013">As I said, Canadians deserve accountability. We were promised that we would have the most accountable government in history. With this Liberal government, Canadians have seen anything but that, so it is important to ask why. Why is this government refusing to respect the will of this place and respect Canadians?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6812014">Madam Speaker, on June 2, the House of Commons issued an order for unredacted documents that pertain to the transfer of viruses from the National Microbiology Lab to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in March of 2019, and the departure of two National Microbiology Lab scientists. As we know, the government is responsible for protecting certain sensitive information that may include safeguards, for example, around personal information and privacy, or information that could pertain to national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812015">The government has actually tried to comply with the intent of the order while, at the same time, respecting the law that is on the books and ensuring that security-related information and privacy are, in fact, properly safeguarded. This matter was referred to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians for its review on June 4 and the Public Health Agency of Canada has, in fact, provided to that committee the unredacted documents as was requested by Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812016">I will take a minute to outline, on behalf of the government, how it arrived at this particular decision. I will start with a couple of words about the National Microbiology Lab. This is a lab that provides critical scientific leadership for Canada's response to COVID-19. As we speak, that laboratory is conducting more than 100 research studies on COVID-19 that range from designing and testing vaccines, to investigating treatments, to understanding the genetic fingerprint of the virus. A very important part of that lab's work is international collaboration. Throughout the pandemic, the laboratory has worked with both domestic and international partners to combat the disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812017">As the government has outlined on a few occasions, the two former employees named in the order are no longer working for the Public Health Agency of Canada. As well, as was noted on multiple occasions, there is no connection between the transfer of the virus as cited in the order and the subsequent departure of these employees. There is also no link to COVID-19. Though additional information was redacted to protect privacy and for security reasons, the government wants to outline that the National Microbiology Lab continues to play a critical role in protecting the health and safety of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812018">The government is seeking to be open and transparent, but it is important to highlight that there is a balance to be struck to ensure that very sensitive information can, in fact, be protected. Twice the Public Health Agency appeared before the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations to respond to the questions on this matter. In addition, the agency has promptly responded to all requests for information, again while respecting its obligations under the laws that were, in fact, passed by Parliament. Sharing the relevant information is, indeed, a balancing act, one that requires us to consider various laws, duties and the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812019">The government is and will remain committed to being as responsive as possible to parliamentarians and to Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6812020">Madam Speaker, it would be much easier to take the <Affiliation DbId="272434" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> at his word that the government was acting with the best intention of Canadians in mind, and not simply looking to protect its own political self-interest. We have seen illegally redacted documents provided to the health committee against orders of that committee, to the finance committee and we have seen it now to this special committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812021">While the Liberals may believe that they are acting with the best interests in mind, they are contravening lawful orders of the documents that have been ordered with provisions for national security that would allow for the parliamentary law clerk, an impartial intermediary, to make those redactions and allow Canadians to have their continued confidence in public institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812022">That is what we are looking to do. That is what the opposition is looking to do, striking a balance where they can hold the government to account in a responsible way and protect the confidence of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6812023">Madam Speaker, there is no question that Parliament's oversight is required so the government can function at its best. The government respects the need for transparency and understands the importance of accountability, though it also understands the importance of protecting sensitive information. In this case, disclosure of the documents, without certain safeguards in place, would potentially put very sensitive information at risk for public release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812024">As I mentioned previously, the government has already provided the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians with all of the unredacted documents that have been requested. The committee has the statutory mechanisms and protections needed to safely review this sensitive information while maintaining the important aspect of confidentiality.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6812025">Madam Speaker, average Canadian workers and owners of small and medium-sized business have been hit hard by the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. I have heard from many business owners who are struggling to pay their bills and keep their businesses open, and I want them to know that I will not stop advocating on their behalf. In this Parliament we worked together to provide financial supports to individuals and businesses, but these supports have not been enough. Too many Canadians are falling through the cracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812026">In March the Canadian Federation of Independent Business reported that one-sixth of small businesses in Canada are at risk of permanently closing. The average small business is now $170,000 in debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812027">Not everyone in Canada has been suffering financially through the pandemic. A tiny minority of ultra-wealthy citizens and large corporations have greatly increased their fortunes while so many Canadians are suffering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812028">Banks and their CEOs have been some of the worst pandemic profiteers. Democracy Watch reports that four of Canada's six big banks are among the 50 most profitable banks in the world. While raking in profits, several of these big banks have raised their service fees during the past year or are planning to do so this summer. TD Bank reported second-quarter net income of $3.7 billion, 147% higher than last year. Its spokesperson was quoted as saying that fee increase decisions are never made lightly and only occur after careful consideration and review. Canadians would like to know exactly what careful consideration and review big banks go through before deciding to increase their fees during a global pandemic. Is being one of the top 50 most profitable banks in the world not enough? Do they need to be in the top 20?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812029">Credit card companies charge an average annual rate of 20% on top of annual fees and cash withdrawal fees. Businesses are charged transaction fees, known as “interchange rates”, for every credit card swipe. In Canada, the average interchange rate is 1.4%. Retail giants like Walmart can negotiate very low interchange rates, while many small businesses pay between 2.5% to 3% per transaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812030">In 2018, the government struck deals with Visa and Mastercard to lower their average interchange rates from 1.5% to 1.4%, but that was hardly worth celebrating. Even before the pandemic hit, the European Union had capped interchange rates at 0.3%. The sky did not fall and credit card companies still operate and make profits. The major difference is that the burden on small and medium-sized businesses has eased. Is agreeing to interchange rates nearly five times higher than the EU the best we can do?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812031">Low-income Canadians are often forced to use payday lenders to cover financial shortfalls or unforeseen expenses. Short-term payday loans are regulated by the provinces, and their annualized interest rates could be as high as 400% to 500%. Some payday lenders offer long-term loans and lines of credit that are federally regulated. Annualized interest rates on these types of loans are as high as 50% and legally capped at 60%. There is no justification for capping rates at 60% when interest rates are at historic lows. This is predatory lending, and the government is facilitating it. This industry preys off people in need and locks them into a cycle of endless debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812032">Canadians want to know when the government will step in and protect them from gouging by big banks, credit card companies and payday lenders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6812034">The past 15 months have not been easy for anyone. The COVID-19 pandemic and recession have affected every Canadian in some way, in particular low-income Canadians and small businesses. We are seeing some light at the end of the tunnel now, but we have to remain vigilant and not take half measures until we know this is behind us. That is why our government is continuing to offer support programs for individuals and businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812035">Turning to the issue of bank fees, we understand how essential it is for Canadians to rely on strong consumer protection standards in their dealings with their banks. The government takes the protection of financial consumers very seriously so that we can ensure all Canadians benefit from strong consumer protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812036">As we well know, the pandemic has caused financial challenges and uncertainty for Canadians in every region of the country. We understand why so many people are concerned about higher bank fees. The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada is currently conducting research to obtain a fuller picture of the impact of COVID-19 on financial consumers. In a recent survey, it found that 30% of Canadians were paying additional bank fees as a result of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812037">The most common fees were overdraft fees, ATM fees, withdrawal fees, late payment fees and insufficient funds fees. Three of these examples either directly or indirectly relate to shortages of cash, which disproportionately impact lower-income people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812038">We have to be a little careful here. I am sure the hon. member will appreciate that financial institutions make decisions with respect to things such as the fees they charge their clients independent of the government. That does not mean there is no role for the government to play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812039">Over the past few years, we have introduced a number of measures aimed at improving the confidence of Canadians in their banks and in our financial consumer protection system. In budget 2018, the government introduced certain measures to strengthen consumers' rights and interests when dealing with the banks and to improve the ability of the FCAC to protect consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812040"> In 2018, the government also helped to secure voluntary commitments from Visa, Mastercard and American Express that would lead to lower costs for businesses, resulting in annual savings for small and medium-sized enterprises estimated at about a quarter of a billion dollars a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812041">In the most recent budget, the government committed to launching consultations on further lowering credit card transaction fees. This would help small businesses affected by interchange fees and would ensure consumers' existing reward points are protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812042">We are also moving forward with a consultation to specifically lower the rate of interest in the Criminal Code of Canada applicable to, as the member suggested, payday loans offered by payday lenders. This, again, disproportionately impacts low-income folks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812043">As well, I will mention briefly that as a result of a recent meeting I learned of an incredible Canadian company. Borrowell will extend new choices to Canadians by providing new technology, giving them lots of choice and creating jobs here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812044">I look forward to the follow-up from my friend and colleague on the other side.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6812046">The big Canadian banks are some of the most profitable in the world, and they should not be raising fees during the pandemic when workers are having a tough time paying their bills and keeping roofs over their heads. Where is the regulation? Why is the government allowing this to happen when so many small and medium-sized Canadian businesses are facing bankruptcy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812047"> Meyers Norris Penny reported in April that over half of Canadians were $200 away from not being able to cover their monthly expenses. That figure was 10% higher than it was in December 2020. To call this extremely alarming would be a huge understatement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812048">Canadians deserve better protection from excess profiteering. It is time for the government to tighten regulations on banking fees, credit card rates and interest rates charged by payday lenders. I am glad to hear that this is moving forward—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6812051">Since the very beginning of this crisis, our focus has been to do whatever it takes to help Canadian workers and businesses through these tough times. We understand that there needs to be faith that the economy is not just working, but working for everyone. We continue to have a focus on helping some of the most vulnerable and hardest-hit people and businesses in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812052">As things reopen, we know that our support has to evolve to continue to support the recovery. The government has implemented different measures to better protect consumers, as I noted before. In the most recent budget, launching consultations on the reduction of credit card transaction fees and the reduction of the criminal rate of interest on payday loans, specifically, are important measures that speak directly to the issue that the member has raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6812053">We need to continue to focus not on empowering the wealthiest in Canada, but on developing supports that will allow us to recover in a way that allows the most vulnerable Canadians to see themselves in the recovery. At the end of the day, Canadians deserve to know that our government has their backs.</ParaText>
