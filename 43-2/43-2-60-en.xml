              <ParaText id="6502358">Today, all Quebec publishers are demanding that Ottawa correct the serious inequity between web giants and our media when it comes to advertising revenues generated from sharing the work of our content creators on digital platforms. Without the work of journalists, there would be no stories to share on social media. The content is coming from our media, not from Facebook or Google.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502359">If we do not protect content creators, we will lose a pillar of public and democratic life. Ottawa has to take action to ensure that the work of our media benefits our media. Ottawa needs to make web giants pay taxes on the profits they are making here and put that money into a fund to support our media and culture.</ParaText>

However, a few unsatisfied Sikh members of Parliament stood against their own government, used all the tools and ulterior motives, pressurized the government and got Khalistani extremism removed from the report.

There are communities like Lillooet, B.C., which put forward an application but had it disqualified. Urban centres should not automatically be first in line for government services. Once-vibrant small communities are emptied out as vulnerable people leave their hometowns in search of housing and other supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502398"> We know that housing is an essential component of our economic recovery and necessary to secure our future.

              <ParaText id="6502578">Mr. Speaker, the workers at CESSCO, a company in Edmonton Strathcona, have been locked out by their employer since June. Instead of negotiating, that same employer was able to access federal dollars through the wage subsidy program to hire scab labour. Last week, those workers were locked out in -40 weather while scabs collected their paycheques, paid for by the government. I wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> over a month ago and I have heard nothing back. </ParaText>

Within weeks we delivered the CERB and a few weeks later the wage subsidy program to support Canadians right across the country. We did that because all parties worked together to get this legislation through in exceptional circumstances and to be there for Canadians who needed it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502581">Since that moment, we have continued to refine and improve the system to make sure that no Canadians are falling through the cracks. We continue to know that there are many Canadians across the country who continue to need support. We will be there for them. As I said from the beginning, we will be there for Canadians as long as it takes, whatever it takes.</ParaText>

We are free to speak our minds, and we need to preserve that right.</ParaText>

The government is firmly in favour of single sports betting. This is why on November 26 of last year we introduced Bill <Document DbId="10983057" Type="3">C-13</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code with regard to single event sport betting. We also supported unanimous consent motions to pass Bill <Document DbId="10983057" Type="3">C-13</Document> at all stages in December. We were disappointed it did not pass.</ParaText>

This bill aims to limit the exposure of victims' families to the people who abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered their loved ones during automatic parole hearings after 25 years of incarceration and every two years after, despite the fact that they are likely never to be granted parole. Many of these criminals have used their parole hearings as a platform to revictimize the families by recounting their crimes in grotesque detail, seeking to terrorize the families. </ParaText>

The petition also raises concerns about same-day death: the possibility that someone could request and receive euthanasia on the same day as a result of the elimination of the 10-day reflection period. The petitioners want to see that reflection period left in place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502666"> The petitioners point out that the Canadian Medical Protective Association, the CMPA, was incorporated by an act of Parliament in 1913 and that Canada remains the only country in the world with a medical protective association. This association is subsidized by taxpayer dollars and has $5.4 billion in assets that increase annually. They add that the CMPA uses what has been described by judges as scorched-earth tactics to defend doctors accused of medical errors and that only 2% cases are settled in favour of patients. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502667">The petitioners therefore ask that the government conduct a forensic examination of the CMPA and that the government defund the CMPA and repeal the act that incorporated it. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6502685">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to request an emergency debate on the growing crisis of housing affordability across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502686">An estimated 1.8 million Canadian households spend more than the affordability threshold of 30% of their income on rent, and 80% of those households spend more than 50%. An estimated 2.4 million Canadian households experienced core housing needs in 2020. Hundreds of thousands are on the verge of becoming homeless and joining the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who are already homeless. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502687">The affordable housing crisis in Canada is a result of structural problems that cannot be fixed by spending taxpayers' dollars alone. It requires regulation and an all-of-government approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502688">Canadian real estate was identified as a major vehicle for money laundering and as a tax haven for the world's ultra-wealthy. This has driven up the price of real estate in major cities, and the ripple effect is part of the cause of an affordability crisis across the country. At the same time, real estate investment trusts, which receive a massive tax exemption, and other big investors are using predatory practices, raising rents by huge amounts with little notice or using “renovictions” to empty buildings and jack up rents. Some investors even leave units empty, because empty units increase demand and rental prices, and real estate values continue to rise regardless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502689">Low-wage workers, people who lost work due to COVID-19 restrictions and people living on fixed incomes are finding themselves in a precarious situation in communities across Canada. Those evicted are facing substantial rent increases, have serious problems finding reasonable rents and face potential homelessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502690">Last week, Vancouver City Council passed a motion to communicate to the federal government its concerns about the impact that real estate investment trusts and big investors are having on the human right to housing, the commodification of housing, housing security and affordability for Vancouver residents. It intends to ask the government to protect and invest in existing rental stock for acquisition by non-profits and co-operatives. Like many communities, Vancouver is in the midst of an affordable housing emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502691"> Existing government programs are oversubscribed and insufficient to meet demands. Investment companies are flipping rental units and removing them from affordable housing stock faster than new subsidized units can be built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502692">This Parliament needs to address housing affordability and homelessness as twin emergency national crises. Holding an emergency debate will allow members of the House to discuss the crisis in their communities and assist in identifying options for lasting solutions to the housing affordability crisis. Those solutions might include such things as ensuring that the loopholes that allow residential real estate to be used for money laundering and tax evasion are properly closed, creating national standards for rental and vacancy controls, instituting empty-home taxes on buildings and units left vacant by foreign and corporate residential property owners, regulation of foreign investment in residential real estate and removing tax exemptions for real estate investment trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502693">It is unreasonable to ask Canadians to pour billions of tax dollars into affordable housing while foreign investors and corporate interests are able to continue using predatory practices to destroy the Canadian housing market. The housing policy of the Government of Canada recognizes that housing is a fundamental human right as defined by international human rights law. This Parliament must do more to protect these rights. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502697">Before I get into the substance of the bill, I would like to remind the House that it has taken decades of work to get to where we are today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502698">Negotiations and discussions have been taking place at the United Nations for over 20 years. Many Canadian indigenous leaders, speaking on behalf of the indigenous people of the world, have been strong advocates for a human rights instrument that would take into account the unique experiences and historical situations of the world's indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502699">I must acknowledge the tremendous efforts of parliamentarians and indigenous leaders in Canada who have proposed legislative frameworks for the implementation of the declaration since it was adopted by the United Nations in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502700">I especially want to recognize the efforts of our former colleague Romeo Saganash, who introduced private member's Bill C-262 in the last Parliament. This bill was read and studied in quite some detail. His efforts brought us to this point and remind us of the constructive discussions that contributed to the drafting and presentation of Bill C-15. I thank Mr. Saganash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502701">Bill C-15 and our endorsement of the UN declaration are intended to renew and strengthen the relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples, a relationship based on recognition, rights, respect, co-operation, partnership and reconciliation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502702">It is also part of a broader work to make progress together on our shared priorities for upholding human rights, affirming self-determination, closing socio-economic gaps, combatting discrimination and eliminating systemic barriers facing first nations, Inuit and Métis peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502703">The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is an international human rights instrument that affirms the rights that constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of indigenous peoples. It includes 46 articles that affirm a broad range of collective and individual rights, including rights related to self-determination and self-government; equality and non-discrimination; culture, language and identity; lands, territories and resources; and treaty rights, among others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502704">The declaration also recognizes that the situation of indigenous peoples varies from region to region and country to country. As such, it provides flexibility to ensure rights are recognized, protected and implemented in a manner that reflects the unique circumstances of indigenous peoples across Canada. This means that implementation of the rights it describes must respond to the specific and unique circumstances in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502705">In Canada, both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in 2018 called upon governments in Canada to fully adopt and implement the UN declaration in partnership with indigenous peoples. We heard these calls, and in 2016 the Government of Canada endorsed the declaration without qualification and committed to its full and effective implementation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502706">We have been making significant progress on the implementation of the declaration on a policy base. While we have done this, Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> would create a legislated, durable framework requiring government to work collaboratively with indigenous peoples to make steady progress in implementing the declaration across all areas of federal responsibility. This reflects the sustained transformative work that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and so many others have repeatedly told us is required to truly advance reconciliation in Canada.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6502707">Some of the declaration's principles are already included in several Canadian laws, policies and programs, such as section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the right to equality, and the protections against discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502708">Working within Canada's legal framework, the Government of Canada has also taken measures to better reflect the declaration in federal policy and legislation, such as the recent initiative, An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families, and the Indigenous Languages Act. Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> represents another important step forward. By working in co-operation and partnership with indigenous peoples, we are creating new opportunities to dismantle colonial structures, establish strong, lasting relationships, close socio-economic gaps, and promote greater prosperity for indigenous peoples and all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502709">I would like to turn now to the key elements of Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502710">The bill makes a number of important statements in the preamble by acknowledging the importance of the declaration as a framework for reconciliation, healing and peace; recognizing inherent rights; acknowledging the importance of respecting treaties and agreements; and emphasizing the need to take diversity across and among indigenous peoples into account in implementing the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502711">The preamble also specifically recognizes that international human rights instruments, such as the declaration, can be used as tools to interpret Canadian law. This means that the human rights standards they outline can provide relevant and persuasive guidance to officials and courts. While this does not mean that international instruments can be used to override Canadian laws, it does mean that we can look to the declaration to inform the process of developing or amending laws and as part of interpreting and applying them. This principle is further reflected in section 4, which affirms the Government of Canada's commitment to uphold the rights of indigenous peoples and the declaration as a universal human rights instrument with application in Canadian law. Together, the objective of these acknowledgements is to recognize existing legal principles and not give the declaration itself direct legal effect in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502712">The bill also includes specific obligations intended to provide a framework for implementing the declaration over time. By requiring the Government of Canada to, first, take measures to align federal law with the declaration in clause 5; second, to develop an action plan in consultation and co-operation with indigenous peoples in clause 6; and third, to report to Parliament annually on progress in clause 7, Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> proposes a clear pathway to stronger, more resilient relationships between the government and indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502713">Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> would also contribute to our efforts to address discrimination, socio-economic disparities and other challenges on which we continue to make progress. By mandating a collaborative process for developing a concrete action plan on these and other human rights priorities, we should see an improvement in trust and a decrease in recourse to the courts to resolve disputes over the rights of indigenous peoples.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502714">I would now like to talk about how Bill C-15 was developed. This bill was the result of our collaboration and consultation over the last several months with indigenous rights holders, leaders and organizations. Using the former private member's bill, Bill C-262, as a starting point in these discussions, we worked closely with the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and the Métis National Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502715"> We also received valuable input from modern treaty and self-governing nations, rights holders, indigenous youth, and regional and national indigenous organizations, including organizations representing indigenous women, two-spirit and gender-diverse people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502716">All of this feedback helped shape this proposed legislation, and we thank everyone who participated. We also held talks with the provincial and territorial governments, as well as with stakeholders from the natural resources sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502717">These discussions were enriched by the contributions of indigenous representatives and provided an opportunity to learn about many of the efforts and initiatives already under way in the provinces and territories, and in various natural resource sectors, to further engage indigenous communities, create partnerships and lasting relationships, and work collaboratively to support responsible economic development that includes indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502718">People always say that young people are our best hope for the future. There is a lot of truth in that, and we held a virtual round table with indigenous youth to ensure that their perspectives and their vision of the future were included in the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502719">First nations, Inuit and Métis youth from across the country shared their views on the bill and their priorities for the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. I am grateful that they took the opportunity to ask me many difficult questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502720">Looking back on that event, it is clear to me that young indigenous people have a vision for a better Canada. This stems from the vision of the future that they have for their nation and their people. They see a future in which strong, self-determined indigenous peoples thrive and are connected to the land and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502721">Young indigenous people see a future in which indigenous-Crown relations are truly nation-to-nation, reflecting equality and respect, and not colonial attitudes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502722">Clearly, we still have a long way to go together to build that better future. However, it is also clear that Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> will enable us to harness the full potential of the declaration in building that better Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502723">To this end, and consistent with this government's mandate commitment, Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> builds on the core elements of former Private Member's Bill <Document DbId="8160636" Type="4">C-262</Document> including the requirement to align federal laws with the declaration over time, develop and implement an action plan in consultation and co-operation with indigenous peoples, and report to Parliament on progress annually. However, our recent engagement process led to a number of key enhancements. In addition to new language in the preamble highlighting the contributions the declaration can make to reconciliation, to sustainable development, and to responding to prejudice and discrimination, the addition of a purpose clause and more detail with respect to the development of an action plan and annual reporting requirements build on and enhance what was set out in Bill C-262.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502724">Over the course of our engagement, we heard some questions about the scope of Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> and the concerns that it might create economic uncertainty. Let me be clear: Bill C-15 would impose obligations on the federal government to align our laws with the declaration over time and to take actions within our areas of responsibility to implement the declaration, in consultation and co-operation with indigenous peoples. It would not impose obligations on other levels of government. However, we know that the declaration touches on many areas that go beyond federal jurisdiction. The preamble, therefore, recognizes that provincial, territorial, municipal and indigenous governments have and would continue to take actions within their own areas of authority that can contribute to the implementation of the declaration. Our goal is not to get in the way of good ideas and effective local action, but to look for opportunities to work collaboratively on shared priorities and in ways that are complementary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502725">The declaration and, by extension, the legislation provides a human rights-based framework for the development of the relationships required to support the effective exercise of the indigenous peoples' right to self-government and self-determination. The exercise of these rights contributes in turn to creating more prosperous, resilient and self-reliant communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502726">Arising from the right to self-determination, “free, prior and informed consent”, as it appears in various articles of the declaration, refers specifically to the importance of meaningful participation of indigenous peoples, through their own mechanisms, in decisions and processes affecting them, their rights and their community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502727">Free, prior and informed consent is a way of working together to establish a consensus through dialogue and other means and of enabling indigenous peoples to meaningfully influence decision-making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502728">Free, prior and informed consent does not constitute veto power over the government's decision-making process. After all, human rights and the resulting obligations and duties, particularly those provided for in the declaration, are not absolute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502729">The declaration states that indigenous peoples have individual and collective rights equal to those of other peoples. That means that the provisions of the declaration, including those that refer to free, prior and informed consent, must be taken in context. Different initiatives will have different impacts on the rights of indigenous peoples and will require different types of approaches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502730">Thus, free, prior and informed consent could require different processes or new creative ways of working together to ensure meaningful and effective participation in decision-making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502731">If passed, this bill will not change Canada's existing duty to consult with indigenous peoples or the other consultation and participation requirements under other legislation such as the new Impact Assessment Act. As also explained in section 2, it would not diminish constitutional protection of the indigenous and treaty rights recognized and affirmed in section 35.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502732">The bill would inform the government on how it plans to phase in its legal obligations in the future. In addition, the bill would do so in a way that would provide greater clarity and foster greater certainty over time for indigenous groups and all Canadians.</ParaText>

As we work to implement the declaration federally and to support indigenous peoples' inherent right to self-determination, we will help develop a stronger, more sustainable and predictable path for indigenous peoples, the Government of Canada and industry. We are ready to work with all levels of government, with indigenous peoples and other sectors of society to achieve the declaration's goals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502734">I would now like to turn to the road map this bill would lay out for the future. If passed, the bill would require the Government of Canada to develop an action plan in consultation and co-operation with first nations, Inuit and Métis to ensure that we achieve the objectives of the declaration. I believe the additional details included in Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> with respect to the action plan are very important. Indeed, the action plan is a central pillar of this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502735">As outlined in clause 6 of the bill, developing and implementing the action plan would mean working together to address injustices, combat prejudice and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination, including systemic discrimination, against indigenous peoples, including all forms of racism against indigenous peoples; promote respect and mutual understanding as well as good relations, including through human rights education; and measures related to monitoring oversight, recourse or remedy and other accountability with respect to the implementation of the declaration, and include measures for the review and amendment of the action plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502736">Some have also wondered why this bill is being introduced right in the middle of a global pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502737">We know that racism and discrimination have not stopped during the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID-19 exacerbated many existing inequalities and hit many people particularly hard, including indigenous people and Black or racialized Canadians. We must not delay efforts to make Canada more just, inclusive and resilient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502738">Bill C-15 could help structure discussions on addressing the inequalities and discrimination against indigenous peoples, which are the root cause of these many vulnerabilities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502739">There will be many benefits as we work together to identify new measures to reflect the rights and objectives in the declaration. Through the process, we will continue to renew and strengthen the nation-to-nation, Inuit, Crown and government-to-government relations; better respect and implement the individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples; build on the momentum to increase the ability of indigenous peoples to exercise their right of self-determination; support indigenous peoples as they restore and strengthen their governance systems and reconstitute their nations as they collectively address the impacts of colonialization and as we create a framework that will help increase clarity and certainty in the long term with respect to the rights of indigenous peoples and their implementation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502740">The bill would provide a road map for generational and transformational work, including how to support, while also getting out of the way of, indigenous self-determination. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502743">I listened to the minister's speech and note that some of the concerns that we have on this side of the House pertain to some of the broadly worded provisions and the implications of that wording and the lack of definition of a number of them.

For example, we know in Canada that that there is a growing white nationalist movement here and abroad. We hear in the news about issues of ongoing racism in policing, and issues with health care, where people are literally dying in hospitals as a result of racism. Let us not forget the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that required an immediate stop to racial discrimination against first nations, a ruling that this government fails to respect, a clear indication of systemic racism. I know the bill mentions systemic barriers. I do not think that goes far enough.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502763">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15, an act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</Document>. This is a bill that has had seven iterations since 2008. Right from the beginning, Conservatives have seen the value in UNDRIP as an aspirational document that provides guiding principles toward reconciliation. We also recognize that many of the articles of UNDRIP are supportable. However, the impact of free, prior and informed consent and its impact on the cultural, social and economic development of indigenous peoples remains unclear. This is not coming as a surprise to the government. Conservatives have been clear from day one that this needed clarification. The fact that the government in its legislation has failed to clarify free, prior and informed consent yet again indicates it simply does not care about the implications that this bill would have for indigenous and non-indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502764">Let me be clear. Conservatives support indigenous communities and their rights. We support the process of reconciliation with Canada's indigenous people, including the importance of education, economic development, and employment and training opportunities. We supported the Indigenous Languages Act and legislation relating to indigenous child welfare. We support many of UNDRIP's articles, but what we oppose is the government's lack of due diligence in putting forward legislation without reaching a common understanding of how free, prior and informed consent will be interpreted. We also do not think that enough consultation has been done with indigenous communities. This is something that has been echoed across the country, in fact. This will lead to uncertainty and could potentially undermine trust if expectations are not met, which could in turn set back reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502765">The government will say not to worry, and that this will be sorted out later. We have heard this many times. In fact, this is exactly what the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> told the Assembly of First Nations recently, but when it comes to taking action that will impact the lives of indigenous peoples, such as ending long-term boil water advisories, the Liberals have consistently failed to keep their promises. The Liberal government has a track record of saying it will sort it out later and then never delivering, so how can we trust them this time to do anything differently? That is why we have to worry with the Liberal government. We have to worry that the undefined statement of free, prior and informed consent could be interpreted as a de facto veto right, and thus have profound detrimental effects not only for a variety of industries across Canada, but for indigenous communities as well. National Chief Perry Bellegarde stated on May 12, 2016, that free, prior and informed consent “very simply is the right to say yes, and the right to say no.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502766">What if two or more indigenous communities want different things? The exact impacts on workers across regions and industries are unknown. The impacts on indigenous entrepreneurs are unknown. However, with the uncertainty created by the Liberals around the interpretation of free, prior and informed consent, the cost to communities, labour unions, indigenous businesses, and provincial and territorial governments could be astronomical. If existing laws and regulations could be superseded by implementing UNDRIP, the regulatory burden on industries could increase and deter business in Canada. This uncertainty hurts both prospective development and indigenous communities. There is a lack of clarity regarding how UNDRIP will work with Canadian jurisprudence and within each level of government. Everyone has a different interpretation. The only people who stand to benefit from a lack of clarity or a lack of definition are lawyers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502767">During a December 3, 2020, briefing for parliamentarians, representatives from the Department of Justice stated that Bill <Document DbId="11007812" Type="3">C-15</Document> respects Canadian jurisprudence, while officials from Natural Resources Canada stated that the bill does not create requirements for industry, but for government. Which representatives were correct? We know from the Wet'suwet'en dispute that many indigenous Canadians believe the government and all industries operating in British Columbia, where a bill similar to Bill C-15 was passed, are bound by UNDRIP. In this case, hereditary chiefs maintained that they had not given their free, prior and informed consent for the pipeline. This was despite the proponent entering into agreements with all elected chiefs and councils along the approved route.</ParaText>

Even within the same community, what if there is conflict between what the elected band council and hereditary chiefs want? Whose free, prior and informed consent trumps whose? Government officials appear to believe that the Indian Act and therefore elected chiefs would take precedence, but then why did the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> enter into an agreement with hereditary chiefs and ignore the elected chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en?

Currently, for example, article 4 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement lays out a division of powers within the territory. It includes a political accord granting powers, such as in other provinces and territories, to a public government and creating space and decisions that would affect the socio-cultural development of Inuit for input from the beneficiary organization.

It added that treaties concluded with European powers are international treaties created for the purpose of co-existence rather than submission to the overall jurisdiction of colonial governments, and that the Canadian government has at no point been able to provide proof that first nations have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes. This statement clearly suggests an unwillingness to accept Canadian jurisprudence as the ultimate authority, calling into question how discrepancies between Supreme Court rulings and UNDRIP articles would be resolved.

              <Affiliation DbId="252595" Type="2">Ms. Marilyn Gladu (Sarnia—Lambton, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6502836">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise tonight to speak to the bill on pharmacare. I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> for bringing it forward. I am sure the reason he has brought it forward is to call for action. There has been a lot of talk about pharmacare but, to be fair, there has not been a lot of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502837"> By way of background, the Liberals have been talking about pharmacare since 1992. They have been studying and talking, but nothing really concrete has come forward. Therefore, I am glad to see we are talking about this tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502838">Members may want to pay heed to my commentary. As a former shadow health minister, I was on the health committee when we studied pharmacare. We have heard all kinds of testimony from every province and territory and from all sorts of Canadians about what they think about pharmacare as well as on related topics, like the drug approval process and rare disease medications, which are also important and need to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502839">All parties in the House are looking for a common outcome. We all want to see Canadians have access to prescription medications. The discussion is about the best route to get there. This bill proposes to put everybody on provincial coverage essentially. That may be an oversimplification, but that is what it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502840">If we look at the situation today, between 95% and 98% of Canadians have prescription drug coverage, depending on which report we look at and depending on the types of coverage. Many people have private plans. Those private plans typically cover more than 14,000 medications compared to the public plans that cover 4,000 to 5,000 medications. The private plans cover, in addition to the medications, many services. People are getting physiotherapy, orthotics, various and sundry, with their plans. However, not a lot of people who have a private plan would want to give that plan up to go on a public plan that would have less coverage. That is certainly one issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502841">Most provinces have a plan that covers people. There are some exceptions. For example, in Ontario, people under 24 get coverage. If they are over 65, they get coverage. If they are on social assistance, they get coverage. Otherwise, unless they have a private plan, there is no coverage. There are some gaps there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502842">The other gap happens in the Atlantic provinces. In some cases, there is a plan there, but because the list of approved drugs is small, many people cannot get coverage for the particular drug they are taking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502843"> This brings up an important consideration when we talk about the bill. The member's bill talks about the Canada Health Act and its requirements for accessibility and universality. If we talk about universality, it is difficult to have that in different provinces when each province has a different list of drugs that are covered. This is called a formulary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502844">Some Canadians move between provinces to get coverage for the medication they need because is not covered by their province. Through consultation and discussion with the provinces and territories, we could come to a more common list of medications that would be covered. That would go a long way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502845">Many people who do not have coverage may not be aware that they have access to a provincial plan. There is an opportunity to increase awareness in that way, and that should be done.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6502846">On the cost of these systems, the cost of transferring and putting everybody on provincial plans has been estimated. The Liberal proposition was for a single-payer federal system of pharmacare, and the Parliamentary Budget Officer costed that at about $20 billion a year. However, some of the costs we were paying for prescription drugs were underestimated by about another $20 billion. Therefore, we are looking at about $40 billion a year for that. I think there was a lot of resistance in the public to that idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502847">We have seen what happens when the federal government tries to implement things. For example, the Canada Revenue Agency has a 30% error rate with the advice it gives people and is not always friendly on the phone. I do not think people would necessarily want their prescription medications administered in that kind of system. However, people are fairly happy with the provincial systems, so filling the gaps that way is one option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502848">Other options could be considered, and it is certainly worthwhile thinking about them. C.D. Howe published a report that said if we put the people who did not have coverage on the existing provincial plans, the cost would be about $2.2 billion a year. That would be reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502849">As an engineer, when I was a contractor, I had to buy my own benefits. For $1,200 a year, I could not only have prescription drug coverage but I could have dental and medical coverage. On a volume discount, if we take the 2% to 5% who do not have coverage and add it up, that is about $2 billion a year. There is an idea where people could go on government benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502850">There are a lot of ways to approach this and the discussion needs to be about which way makes the best use of taxpayer money and takes advantage of some of the systems already in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502851">Let me talk for a minute about rare disease medications, because this proposal would do nothing to address some of the issues with respect to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502852"> Today, to get coverage for rare disease medications, private insurance companies pool their money so not any one company has to take the risk of these very expensive medications, some of which cost $250,000 a year or a million dollars a year. If the government infused money into that pool on the condition that everybody would get their rare disease medications covered, that would be another great way to ensure people would have coverage for some of the most difficult to cover drug costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502853">Access to medications also depends on ensuring that drug companies want to market their drugs in Canada. Unfortunately, the Liberals have put changes in place to the drug approval process which will make the process longer and more costly. As a result, many companies do not want to market their medications in Canada because we are a small population and they would have to operate at a loss. This has also impacted the number of clinical trials happening in Canada. The government needs to definitely reconsider that poorly thought out policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502854">If we look at some of the examples of innovation happening in the world, Chile has a great funding model that is infusing money into a rare disease fund, but also allowing people to buy government bonds that also kick into that fund. There are a number of innovative ideas around the world at which we should take a look.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502855">I look forward to working with my colleagues on this bill toward the common goal of getting prescription medication access for all Canadians. A number of things could happen to our benefit out of this. We would have better volume leverage and could reduce the cost of drugs and take away some of the co-payer issues that provide barriers. I look forward to discussing all these things with my colleagues when this comes to committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502873">It was impossible for the member for <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> to not be aware of this when he introduced his bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502874">Quebec is a progressive nation. It is surprising that the NDP, which calls itself progressive, wants a nation that lags behind ours to tell us what to do. Generally speaking, Quebec society has more comprehensive social programs than Canadian society. Quebec has the best family policy on the continent, which includes parental leave and child care. Quebec has the best access to post-secondary education and the most progressive taxation on the continent. Furthermore, Quebec has a pharmacare plan that leaves no one behind. Everyone is covered by insurance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6502875">Although it is not perfect, our situation is unlike any other in North America. Quebec's pharmacare plan has been leading the pack among Canadian provinces and territories since 1996. Quebec will not entrust the development of its social programs to the neighbouring nation, whose coverage does not compare to ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502876">The members of the Quebec National Assembly are unanimously opposed to this initiative. The members of the Bloc Québécois, who rise in the House to impart the general consensus of the Quebec National Assembly, will not compromise at the expense of Quebeckers to salvage some votes in the west, in the east or in Ontario. Not to mention, Ottawa is not even able to manage its own affairs. Just look at the firearms registry, which ended up costing $2 billion, or the Phoenix pay system; and yet people think Ottawa should manage our pharmacare program?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502877">Quebec is quite capable of improving its own program without surrendering its autonomy. The $3.6-billion price tag for Quebec's public pharmacare plan is fully covered by the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec, or RAMQ, which covers health care costs. What Quebec needs is an increase in health transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502878">Since 2017, the health transfer escalator has been capped at 3%, but health care system costs are going up by about 6% because of factors like technological advances and the aging population. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502879">The Bloc Québécois is asking Ottawa to respect the wishes of Quebec and the provinces and increase its share of health care funding from 22% to 35% unconditionally. Let us not forget that, back when the Canadian system was created, federal funding covered 50% of the cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502880">The Bloc Québécois is also opposed to the creation of a Canadian drug agency that would tell Quebec how to use its drugs. Quebec is already managing its public prescription drug insurance plan expenses itself through the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, the pCPA, and the national institute for excellence in health and social services, or INESSS, and Quebec's system has rigorous criteria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502881">The INESSS supplies Quebec with its own expertise and updates the list of drugs covered by the RAMQ, Quebec's health insurance plan. A new Canadian drug agency would just duplicate the work being done in an area that is not under federal jurisdiction. That is nonsensical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502882"> That is why I moved a motion on October 26 at the Standing Committee on Health to study how reforming patented medicine pricing could affect the whole life sciences ecosystem and patient access to innovative therapies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502883">During the election campaign, the Liberals said they wanted to do something about the cost of drugs used to treat rare diseases. They reiterated that intention in the throne speech, but we are still awaiting the strategy. The federal government needs to give us more details about its plans. Most importantly, it needs to tell us whether it intends to harmonize its rare disease strategy with Quebec's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502884">In closing, recognizing that Quebec's plan is the best one on the continent and emphasizing that Quebec has the right to decide does not mean that our plan is perfect, but Quebeckers are perfectly capable of managing it. The NDP and the Liberals have a harmful obsession with wanting to interfere and wanting to decide for Quebec where Quebec should spend its money. Rather than clinging to its centralizing vision, the government should instead agree to Quebec's demands and permanently and substantially increase health transfers so that Quebec can take care of its people.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6502885">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts on this very important bill. It is an immense honour for me to take the mike right now and speak to my colleague's bill. I want to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> for bringing this bill forward. This is a very special opportunity that we have right now to make a massive difference in the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502886">In Canada in this pandemic, we have seen millions of Canadians lose their jobs, and when they lost their jobs, they also lost their benefits. That means millions of Canadians were not able to purchase the medication they needed. This is on top of the millions of Canadians who already simply cannot afford their medication. Whether they do not have coverage at all or have coverage that costs too much, very, very many Canadians are not taking the medication they need because they simply cannot afford to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502887">I have spoken to so many families and so many people who tell me of the pain of not being able to afford their medication. I think of a family in which the father works in construction, and he has a heart illness that requires him to take medication to stay healthy, but he cannot afford that medication, and on top of that, his children need medication. Therefore, he has to choose not only between paying the bills or buying his medication, but also between buying the medication either for himself or for the children he loves. That is an impossible position to be in, and he is not alone. There are so many families that face the same decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502888">We know that one out of five Canadians are not taking their medication, simply because they cannot afford to. We know that when someone cannot treat an illness, they end up at the worst stage of that illness, and it costs the system and the family and the person so much more. Having universal access to medication so that everyone in our country could afford it would dramatically improve the lives of everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502889">The Liberals have been promising universal pharmacare for 23 years. They promised again in 2019, but have people seen any difference in their lives when it comes to accessing medication? They have not. We have seen, sadly and again and again, that the Liberal government sides with the pharmaceutical industry instead of with Canadians who are desperate to stay healthy and afford their medication.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502890">We have a concrete solution. The solution is to use the combined power of our entire nation to negotiate better prices so that everyone in our country can afford medication. This is so important. This is an opportunity to save lives. I am asking everybody to think about the millions of Canadians who cannot afford medication, to think about our health care system that allows someone to go to a doctor and be diagnosed with an illness but not to be able to afford the medication they need to stay healthy, to think about the only health care system in the world that provides universal health care but does not include medication coverage, and to pick up their phone and call their local MP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502891">I ask people to sign petitions and write letters. We have a week left. This vote on the first step to establish the first-of-its-kind, free medication coverage for all Canadians is next week. We can put pressure. We can show that this is the way forward and we can win. People have shown the power of organizing; they have shown again and again that when people come together, we fight and we win.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502892">Once implemented, medication coverage for all Canadians would mean that no one in our country would have to worry about paying for medication. If someone needed medication in this country, they would use their health card and not their credit card. That dream can be a reality, and once implemented, it would establish a savings of at least $4.2 billion that could be reinvested into our health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502893">Here is an opportunity for the Liberal government to back up its words. Its own report states that one of the key steps to establishing a universal public medication-for-all system is to pass a pharmacare act like the one we have proposed. It is far past time to pass such a measure and deliver universal pharmacare to Canadians. Let us get it done now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502894">No one should have to choose between paying the rent and filling a prescription. One in five Canadians is not taking the medication they need because they cannot afford it. Many Canadians are cutting their pills in half or even deciding not to buy their medication at all because they cannot afford it. Too many people are ending up in the emergency room or in the hospital for an extended stay because they cannot afford to take the medication they need. Hundreds of people are dying prematurely every year. Even those with private insurance are seeing the coverage offered by their employer decrease. People are in more precarious jobs, and their family budget is getting tighter and tighter. We need to help families, not make their lives more difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502895">I have met many families in Quebec who say that it is getting harder and harder to buy private prescription drug coverage. It is getting harder and harder to get drug coverage and buy medication. I spoke with unions that represent thousands of workers, and they all say that prescription drug insurance cost workers too much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502896">It is essential to have fully public pharmacare in Quebec and across the country. Canada is the only industrialized country whose health insurance does not include universal, public coverage of prescription medication. That does not make any sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502897">The Liberals have not stopped breaking promises for the past 23 years. They would rather protect the profits of big pharmaceutical and insurance companies than help people. In 2019, they made yet another promise to introduce pharmacare, but they have done nothing concrete since to keep that promise. The Liberals say all the right things in public, but they keep putting powerful pharmaceutical companies' profits ahead of people's needs. They now have an opportunity to vote for our bill to give Canadians a comprehensive universal pharmacare program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502898">This bill is the first step toward creating a pharmacare program. If the Liberals really want to help Canadian families, they can work with us to provide the universal pharmacare program people need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502899">I invite all Canadians to contact their MP and ask him or her to vote in favour of a universal public pharmacare program. We must vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>, a bill to help families and save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502900">I am grateful I had the opportunity to share these words. Again, we have an opportunity to save lives, to help families and workers. It is essential that our health care system cover everyone and that also means providing a universal pharmacare program. Together, we can do this. I invite everyone to demand that we undertake this next step towards a universal, comprehensive health care system.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="253787" Type="18">Mr. Darren Fisher (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6502901">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to address Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>. As all members know, I firmly support national universal pharmacare and the government knows that pharmacare is the missing piece of universal health care in the country. Pharmacare must remain a priority for all members in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502902"> Implementing national universal pharmacare is one of the government's top priorities, as reiterated in the September 2020 Speech from the Throne and in the 2020 fall economic statement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502903">No Canadian should have to choose between paying rent or paying for needed prescription drugs. Too many of my constituents, too many Canadians, are experiencing this every day. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed many unfortunate truths in the country and one of those truths is that too many Canadians are also a step away from this unfortunate reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502904">While drug coverage is an area of provincial-territorial jurisdiction, the pandemic has reminded us that collaboration between governments is essential to support the health of Canadians. The federal government recognizes the important role that both orders of government must play to ensure all Canadians have the drug coverage they need. We understand that the federal government must support provinces and territories as they implement pharmacare so it will become an enduring element of our health system. This simply is not achieved by imposing federal legislation without consultation and without co-operation of our partners at the provincial and territorial level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502905">I firmly support national universal pharmacare and I will continue to work tirelessly with our government to move it forward. I will be opposing this private member's bill. The issue at the heart of the bill and the reason I will be opposing it is that it discounts the need for co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502906"> We know that in order to make national pharmacare a reality in Canada, we need to recognize the key role the provinces and territories play in providing health care for their citizens. The bill misses the mark and overlooks a wealth of experience built up about how to do that, not in Ottawa but in Dartmouth, Victoria, Quebec, Charlottetown and all across this amazing country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502907">Establishing universal pharmacare successfully requires a collective approach, a collaborative approach, where the federal government works with and through the provinces and territories. Unilateral federal action to impose national universal pharmacare as proposed under Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document> would be akin to establishing public medicare for hospital and physician services without prior discussion with provincial and territorial governments and health system stakeholders. Such unilateral action would contradict commitments the Government of Canada has made over the past three decades to take a collective approach to social policy issues of a national concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502908">The government must be careful not to disregard the vital role that provinces and territories currently play in designing and delivering public drug coverage in Canada. Over time, provinces and territories have developed more than 100 distinct public drug plans, typically designed to provide coverage for vulnerable groups, including seniors and people on social assistance. If we are going to transform a complex patchwork of drug coverage into a national pharmacare program, we must do it in collaboration with our partners, relying on the considerable expertise that jurisdictions have in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502909">Our government has been clear in its commitments to national pharmacare. Now is the time for governments to take action and make it a reality. Co-operation from provinces and territories will not just get pharmacare up and running; it will ensure it continues to operate smoothly well into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502910">In the 2020 Speech from the Throne and the fall economic statement, the government reiterated its intention to accelerate steps to implement national universal pharmacare, including a rare disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs; establishing a national formulary and a Canadian drug agency to keep drug prices low; and, perhaps most important, working with those provinces and territories that are willing to move forward without delay. We all know that actions speak louder than words, which is why I am pleased to say that our government has already started taking these steps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502911">In November, the government initiated discussions with provinces and territories on the strategy for high-cost drugs for rare diseases. Earlier this month, the government began engaging with key partners and stakeholders, including patients and patient groups. As public engagement continues, our government will also consult with clinicians, academics, researchers, health technology assessment organizations, pharmaceutical manufacturers, private insurance providers and indigenous partners. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502912">Budget 2019 also announced $35 million over four years to establish a transition office. This office is being created to provide dedicated capacity and leadership to advance work on pharmacare-related priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502913">We are committed to taking the appropriate next steps to implement national universal pharmacare. We are rolling up our sleeves and putting the resources in place to make it happen. First ministers have initiated a dialogue on health care funding, and that conversation will continue. In parallel, the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> will seek to establish a collaborative process with willing provinces and territories to define the broad terms of the pharmacare plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502914">As I have said, our government fully supports national universal pharmacare and will continue to do the work needed to make sure this becomes a reality for all Canadians. Although we support the spirit of Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>, we recognize that imposing these criteria on the provinces and territories without working with them would be premature and would not build national pharmacare as an enduring final piece of Canada's universal health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502915">People do not frame and put a roof on a house without building a strong foundation first. That is why we are moving forward with willing jurisdictions to build a collective commitment to national pharmacare, guided by the advisory council on the implementation of national pharmacare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502916">Turning our current patchwork of drug plans into a coherent, comprehensive approach that benefits all Canadians will be no small feat. As we move forward, we need a thoughtful conversation about how best to meet this challenge together. We must work with the provinces and territories, as I have said, to implement a national pharmacare plan that works well for our residents. We must work with first nations, Inuit and Métis governments and representative organizations to make sure national pharmacare is appropriate for their communities. We must work with patients and providers to make sure a national pharmacare plan gets Canadians the drugs they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502917">I am looking forward to discussions with provincial and territorial counterparts. Together, we are making progress toward a pharmacare program that will meet the needs of all Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6502918">Mr. Speaker, the most difficult medication to buy is the one that is not available in Canada. It is the one someone finds out about after going to their doctor and being told that it is in the United States, and if they were an American citizen, they could get access to it. However, since they are a Canadian, they cannot. That is the news that too often happens to patients with rare diseases and to their families. My family is one of those families. The families dealing with cystic fibrosis, with SMA and with cystinosis are other ones. The list goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502919">Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document> is a solution looking to address the wrong problem. The problem is access, and access is what I want to talk about this evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502920">I have gone through the speech by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>. My colleagues from <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="252595" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation> went over a lot of territory in pointing out what is wrong with this particular piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502921">The legislation is trying to address the wrong problem. I want to demonstrate that by sharing some of the issues I have with what the member for <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> said and address them piece by piece to demonstrate why this is the wrong bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502922">It does not achieve any goals. The goal should be to provide access to patients in Canada through greater choice in drugs, drugs that will actually ensure they get over their condition or that will provide a therapy that reduces their symptoms, instead of looking at their American counterparts, citizens of America. Some of them are dual citizens, and they, for example, can have access to that medication when they go to the United States, but they cannot access it here in Canada unless they are one of the very few who have a special access program for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502923">One of the NDP members mentioned that currently in Canada we have a patchwork of provincial systems. We know that in Canada, 90% to 98% of Canadians have access to some type of either private or public insurance. In fact, nearly all the provinces have a public insurer. In Alberta, it is the Alberta Blue Cross that people can get access to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502924">Two provinces that I am aware of have already said they will not participate in national pharmacare. In November of 2019, Alberta finance minister Travis Toews sent a letter to the federal government indicating that the provincial government, the Government of Alberta, would not participate in national pharmacare. It will want an opt-out. Members for the Bloc have said that their provincial government will not participate either. What will happen? We will have a patchwork system again. Again, because this bill does not consult with anybody or ask the provinces what they are thinking or recognize that it is in the jurisdiction of provinces, it does not achieve any of the goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502925">Speaking of access, the Ontario government, the previous government, took a bunch of people and put them onto OHIP+. It transferred 2.1 million Ontarians who already had private plans onto a public plan at a higher cost, a plan that provided worse coverage than what they had before. I had many people explain their particular situation. They liked their private plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502926">When a survey is done to ask people if they like the private plan they are on or the public plan they are on, most Canadians, by a wide majority, say that they do like the plan they are on. I agree that there are people who have difficulty paying for some of the copayments, but this bill does not address that. This bill proposes to centralize everything in Ottawa and then figure it out later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502927">I have come to believe, after five and a half years here in Ottawa, that when someone says they will figure it out later, it usually will cause harm to Canadians in the long term, especially if they are one of those one in 12 Canadians dealing with a rare disease. Many people have someone in their life who has a rare disease. I have three children with a rare disease. I had a daughter pass away from a different rare disease three years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502928">The problem in Canada, as I said, is being made worse by federal government action through the PMPRB. This problem will not be addressed through anything in this particular piece of legislation. This measure is coming forward because of a false belief that it could somehow artificially reduce the price of medication coming into the market in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502929">There is a PBO estimate that has been provided and repeated now by several members that the total spent on public health care will be reduced by $4 billion to $4.5 billion. They call it the universal discount. Actually, if we look at the data in the PBO report, 25% is completely random. This is one of the rare times when I disagree with the methodology used by the PBO. This 25% discount is already happening through the pCPA, the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which is used by the provinces to negotiate with manufacturers. They are basically assuming an extra 25% discount “just because”. I do not think that is the way statistics should be done and I disagree with the analysis.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="40">(1940)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6502930">In fact, one of the members on the NDP side then went on to quote New Zealand as a good example of how it had been able to reduce drug costs. What people in New Zealand do not want to have is a rare disease. There is very little access to rare disease medication or the latest and greatest most innovative drugs to address their condition. There are countless examples online of New Zealand citizens fleeing to other countries to obtain access to medication. New Zealand is the worst example anywhere in the world if people have a rare disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502931">There is a Yiddish saying, “He who runs away from fire, falls into the water” and that is what is happening here. There is a problem and the solution that is being called upon is a centralization of all the plans in Canada to wipe out the architecture, the jobs, the system that many Canadians rely on and generally like. It is not perfect; there are issues with it. We are running into a system, we are going to fall into the water and drown. Things would be made worse by the changes being proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502932">On the issue of PMPRB's costing, for example, we often talk about rare disease drug costs and how it puts a huge dent in provincial budgets. If we look at non-oncology drugs, 70% of what the PMPRB says is for rare disease medication is actually being used for secondary uses. Therefore, if people have a rare disease and there is a drug for, it is given by a doctor and it is used, but then there has to be a second, third or fourth usage. The medical system says that it can be used for those other purposes. That is being included in the final statistics. It is wrong to say that rare disease patients will cost the system more when in fact different types of medication are also used for other purposes or uses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502933">According to the annual report of the PMPRB, the changes in the cost are 2.5% to 2.6%. I will credit the Canadian Forum for Rare Disease Innovators for these statistics and these points. It is very compelling evidence that the costs for rare diseases are not caused by rare disease patients. In fact, it is other uses for the same innovative medicine that is coming to Canada. To reiterate my point, the hardest medication to purchase in Canada is that which is not available in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502934">I want to take a moment to credit and thank Alberta Minister of Health Tyler Shandro, for his January 17 interim agreement for Zolgensma, which is a groundbreaking, innovative medication for children with SMA type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, one of the most dangerous conditions that will kill children if they do not get access to a type of medication. This is the same minister who compassionately approved and ensured there was access in Alberta quickly for Spinraza, three weeks after he was named minister. I told him I would hound him until he made it happen. To his credit, he did, and compassionately years later he ensured there was access to Zolgensma for children under age 18 in Alberta. I do not believe a national pharmacare minister like that could act as quickly as a provincial minister could act when he feels the pressure from constituents, residents and elected officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502935">We have cystinosis, examples of cystic fibrosis, and Trikafta and Orkambi. There is groundbreaking medication out there being made available to people living in other countries that is not available here. The bill would not fix any of those issues. There are other solutions to fill the gaps in place and I would love to discuss those solutions and look for ways to improve the system in different matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502936">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252813" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> brought up a few of them, so I will reiterate them. Common drugs are classified in different countries as over the counter. Australia does an amazing job of this, as does the United Kingdom. We can look at what the public health spends on certain medications and maybe find a lower dose that could be available over the counter. Some antibiotics come to mind. Some estimates suggest that just three of those drugs could save $1 billion a year on drug spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502937"> There are other things we could do to reduce the bureaucracy in the system. Too many Canadians are trapped between the CADTH approval and the pCPA reimbursement agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502938">What I care most about is access for patients with rare diseases. Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document> does not achieve any of those goals. I cannot support it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502943">This bill is historic. It is a bill that would give us the potential to make history by finally getting pharmacare to Canadians who so desperately want it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502944"> We have heard today that approximately one out of every five families in Canada struggles to pay for prescription medications, and we know that the claim that all Canadians have access to medication just is not true. It is not accurate. These are not statistics. These are real families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502945">Before COVID-19, when I was able to knock on doors and talk to constituents in person, access to prescription medicine was the number one issue I would hear from people. I remember talking to a man who struggled to speak as he was caught up with emotion. He talked to me about skipping days taking his blood pressure medication, hoping that he would get by: that he would make it and would not die. I spoke to a senior in my own neighbourhood who was sharing a prescription with her husband, because they could not afford both. I will never forget talking to one young father who implored me to get pharmacare passed. It was not because his family needed it. His family was doing quite well, but he knew families at his daughter's child care centre who did not have access, and he wanted to make sure that those children were taken care of. This was all before the pandemic, and before things got worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502946">There is no doubt that COVID-19 has made Canadians' ability to access medication so much worse. Millions of Canadians who lost their employment due to COVID-19 also lost their prescription drug coverage. People who could count on their health plans before COVID no longer could. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502947">In Alberta, when we were entering the pandemic about a year ago, our provincial Conservative government cut drug benefits for seniors, spouses and dependants so 46,000 people, mainly with ongoing health issues, including dependants living with disabilities, were suddenly without coverage. I find it shocking that the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="252805" Type="2">Calgary Shepard</Affiliation> can speak of Minister Shandro as being compassionate, when 46,000 Albertans lost their drug coverage. Many Canadians were facing the stark reality that our medicare system was not going to be able to keep them healthy. This pandemic has opened their eyes, and COVID-19 has shown us just how vulnerable we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502948">Canadians have been waiting for this. Canadians have been waiting for nearly 60 years to get prescription medications included in our health care system. Twenty-three years ago, the Liberals first promised Canadians a national pharmacare program, and they have been repeating that promise ever since. We have had five public commissions on pharmacare, and study after study. If the member for <Affiliation DbId="252805" Type="2">Calgary Shepard</Affiliation> does not want to believe the PBO report, perhaps he will believe the Hoskins report. All of these reports said the same thing: Canadians need pharmacare, and pharmacare will save Canadians money. However, here we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502949">As Canadians face an unprecedented health crisis with COVID-19, there is another health crisis that we can and need to fix right now. Millions of Canadians are without access to medication, and we can fix that with Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>. We need to vote yes to Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502950">We have an obligation to learn from COVID-19 as well. We have a duty to Canadians to create a better Canada that will be more resilient to the crises of the future, including the next pandemic. We must build systems that protect all Canadians, not just some Canadians and not just Canadians who can afford it. When everyone has access to the medication they need, they are healthier and the burden on our health care system is lessened. It is really that simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502951">The government has floated the idea of partial pharmacare that is not universal. That is not what Canadians want. Canadians want a simple program that includes everyone. Canadians want to go to the pharmacy and pick up their medications. That is the system we want, and that is the system we need: a national universal system protected against people like Jason Kenney who are determined to undermine it, and a system that will actually save Canadians billions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502952">There is something else vitally important that we have learned from COVID-19: Canada has the capacity to do this. We saw how fast Canada moved when the pandemic was declared. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6502953">The cost to enact pharmacare is pennies on the dollar compared to the savings. Pharmacare will save families on average more than $500 a year, whether they are insured or not, and employers and small businesses will save $600 a year per job. Pharmacare will reduce emergency wait times and free up more hospital beds for those who need them. It will save the government billions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502954">I urge this House to follow the recommendations of the Hoskins report and apply them by supporting this bill. The Hoskins report recommends that the federal government enshrine the principles and national standards of pharmacare in federal legislation separate and distinct from the Canada Health Act. The Hoskins report also recommends that the five fundamental principles of medicare embodied in the Canada Health Act also be enshrined in federal pharmacare legislation. Those principles are universality, comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public administration. The Hoskins report also proposes that this legislation come into force no later than January 1, 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502955">Now is the time. Now is the time we can do this. As parliamentarians, this is something we can give to Canadians right now, at a time when they need it more than ever. Today is the day to support pharmacare for all.

              <ParaText id="6502956">Mr. Speaker, it is rare that we have an opportunity in the House of Commons to make a difference in the lives of so many of our constituents. As we well know, over 90% of Canadians support the idea of putting in place public, universal pharmacare. Over 90% means that in every single riding across the country, the vast majority of Canadians support public, universal pharmacare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502957">When Canadians are asked what they are proudest of among our institutions, it is our universal health care system. Of course, the Canada pharmacare act would put in place the same principles around pharmacare that we already have in place around universal health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502958">Any member of Parliament who consults with his or her constituents will get the same reply. Canadians want to see this. Particularly with the pandemic and the devastating impacts that we have seen both on the health and the financial well-being of so many Canadians, it is absolutely essential that we move forward and put in place public, universal pharmacare, which Canadians are asking for and desperately need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502959">We have been at this debate for a few months. Tens of thousands of Canadians have participated. They have participated by emailing their member of Parliament, by phoning their member of Parliament and by telling their member of Parliament to vote yes on Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502960">During this debate, we have seen a number of facts come to light. We were made aware, through this debate, that millions of Canadians have no access to a drug plan. They have to struggle to pay for the medication their doctor has prescribed for their health and well-being. We have also learned that hundreds of Canadians die each year right across the country because they cannot afford to pay for their medication. Through this debate, we have also learned that for 60 years Canadians have been waiting to have the public, universal pharmacare they so desperately need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502961">The Hoskins report points out very clearly what the road map is, which is that we have to lay the foundation by ensuring we have the same principles around public, universal pharmacare that we already have around our public, universal health care system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502962">It would be dangerous to say no to this bill, because that would reject public, universal pharmacare. It would reject the expansion of our public health care system that Canadians are looking for, and it would reject the advisory council's Hoskins report. It would mean that there is no foundation to build the public, universal pharmacare that Canadians so desperately need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502963">During these debates we also learned that many people in Quebec are calling for a universal pharmacare program. Currently, many Quebeckers are not covered, and that is why the major unions are calling for this type of public, universal program. More than 40 or so municipalities in Quebec are calling on MPs to vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>. There is widespread support.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6502964">We have also learned that dozens of organizations with millions of members are asking all members of Parliament to vote yes on Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>. We have doctors and nurses right across the country who are saying that it is absolutely vital for Canadians' health and well-being. We must listen to those voices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502965">I mentioned earlier this is a historic moment. It is one of those moments that determine the strength members of Parliament have in consulting with their constituents, and we need to think of our constituents at this key decision point in our history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502966">I am thinking of Cole and his family. He is a constituent in high school whose family struggles with $1,000 a month in drug costs. Those drug costs, that medication, keeps the father of the family alive. That family struggles and every day has to decide how they can pay for that medication and whether they can also put food on the table and a roof over their heads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502967">Around kitchen tables right across the country, there are millions of Canadian families who are in the same situation. I ask members of Parliament to think of their constituents, more than 90% of whom who support this bill. If members of Parliament do that, I have no doubt they will vote yes next week on Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>, the proposed Canada pharmacare act.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6502974">Mr. Speaker, there has been a great deal of discussion in recent days about the genocide of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in China. The evidence of that genocide could not be clearer, and I look forward to continuing to make arguments about this issue and calling for recognition by the government of that genocide and an appropriate response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502975">However, today I am speaking following a specific question that I asked about the Canada pension plan investments made in Chinese military affiliated tech companies that are playing a significant role in the surveillance, mass detention and, yes, genocide of Uighurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502976">One of the particular characteristics of the Uighur genocide is its high degree of technological sophistication and the use of the latest technologies to screen, track, control, suppress and otherwise violate the rights of Uighurs. These technological tools are deployed to facilitate the internment and population suppression of Uighurs through measures that include a systemic campaign of sexual violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502977">Certain companies that are in some sense private but are also very much state-affiliated are developing the technology for this genocide. People are sitting in office towers making investment decisions to maximize their profits and those of their shareholders by tasking researchers to find ways of better tracking and controlling other human beings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502978">The Canada pension plan invests money around the world with the goal of maximizing return for Canadian investors. It has important work to do in this respect. However, I would firmly contend that its only considerations should not be financial risk or financial return. During the tenure of the current government, our pension dollars have been invested in Dahua and Hikvision, two of the companies that are working closely with the Chinese government and supporting its horrific operations in East Turkestan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502979">We are not just talking about building components or tools that could be used in this context. We are talking about ongoing collaboration to facilitate the customization and deployment of this technology as part of this genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502980">When these issues have been raised in the past, the government has either ignored the question or defended the investment choices of the CPP Investment Board. When this was first raised in the House, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252760" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation> said, on behalf of the government, “I simply want to remind my colleague that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board operates independently, at arms' length from the government, and we expect it to make wise investments in the interest of Canadians and Canadian pensioners.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502981">Frankly, I expect better from the government than to support these investments or to shrug them off. Considerations must include Canadian values as well as Canadian interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502982">While the Conservatives oppose efforts by politicians to micromanage these investments, there must be some minimum moral standards. Those standards should involve clear and unambiguous criteria that exclude investments that violate international law and that involve deep and fundamental violations of international human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502983">I expect and hope for better from the CPP Investment Board, but to be fair to the board, while I want to see minimum moral standards, the board operates within a legislative framework set by politicians. Politicians have to set those minimum standards. They easily could, but they have not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502984">I would like to ask the government this again. Very specifically, what plans does it have to ensure that Canadian pension investment dollars are never again complicit in acts of genocide?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6502985">Mr. Speaker, the human rights violations in China affecting Uighurs and other ethnic minorities are deeply disturbing and of grave concern for Canadians, this government and the global community. The actions of the Chinese government in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, including repressive surveillance, mass arbitrary detentions and religious persecution, run counter to the basic freedoms enshrined in China's own constitution and violate China's international human rights obligations. This government has taken every opportunity to raise this issue, both directly with Chinese authorities and through multilateral institutions. We call on China to address and end the repression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502986">Canada is not alone in voicing concerns. We are working in collaboration with other countries to call on China to abide by its obligations under international human rights law, and we will continue to take action as part of a concerted effort by the broader international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502987">This government recognizes the risks that the alarming human rights situation in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region poses for Canadian businesses and investors. This is one reason the trade commissioner service recently updated its guidance for businesses on the risks of doing business in China, including risks related to human rights abuses and forced labour in their supply chain. We expect all Canadian companies active abroad to respect human rights and adhere to the highest ethical standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502988">As members know, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board was set up by the federal and provincial governments to prudently invest Canada pension plan funds. It is accountable to federal and provincial ministers of finance, but operates at arm's length, as the member said, from Canadian governments. CPP Investments is recognized internationally as a leading example of sound pension plan management. It has an independent, highly qualified board of directors and operates with a commercial investment mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502989">Companies that effectively manage environmental, social and governance factors are more likely to create financial value over the long term, improving investment performance. As such, CPP Investments considers ESG factors, including human rights, when evaluating opportunities, making investment decision and engaging with companies to seek improvements in business practices and disclosure. CPP Investments was a founding signatory and abides by the United Nations-supported principles for responsible investment, which provide guidance for incorporating ESG factors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502990">Just as Canada will continue to hold China to account when it comes to human rights violations, so will we continue to take action to ensure that Canadian supply chains are free of forced labour and that Canadian businesses have the tools they need to mitigate the risks of doing business abroad.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502991">Mr. Speaker, that response was obviously a total farce. The <Affiliation DbId="253803" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> cannot even be bothered to show up here, so we have the <Affiliation DbId="253787" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health</Affiliation> answering questions on things that are totally unrelated to his file. He is not answering the question. In some sense I do not blame him for not answering the question, because this is not even in his file. He has been given a bloody sheet of paper to read on a fundamental issue of genocide, instead of actually engaging with the subject matter at hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502992">My question was about whether the government is prepared to define fundamental minimum moral standards for our investment and whether it is willing to put in place standards to ensure that Canadian pension investments are not complicit in genocide. Essentially, the <Affiliation DbId="253787" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>'s response is no. To the extent that human rights might come into play when considering financial considerations, then they are brought in, but there is no willingness from the government to recognize this problem of Canadian pension investments complicit in genocide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6502996">We have heard from a lot of veterans about the carbon tax. They are paying a lot more carbon tax in their homes and there are a lot of concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502997">However, the carbon tax on agriculture is also growing significantly. We have the carbon tax and the clean fuel standard. It is sort of wreaking havoc in the agricultural sector. I have 50 dairies in my riding. Dairies are not located in cities. They need diesel trucks, huge trucks, to move that milk, which is an actual supply chain of food that we have in our own country, but the carbon tax and the clean fuel standard cost a lot, which they do not get to recoup. It is not rebated to them. We have a great industry in my riding in our country, but they are paying huge costs, and the cost is going to go higher. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502998">This is tough. This is hard. At this time of year, there is a lot of heating of external buildings. We have calving, transporting of feed and shipping of the final product. Whether it is the cattle and calf industry or the dairy industry, the carbon tax and the clean fuel standard are really hurting our agricultural sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6502999">Then they have irrigation. There are 17 irrigation districts in Alberta, five in my riding. At $30, the carbon tax is costing farmers in my constituency, as calculated, over a million dollars. Over a million dollars leaves my constituency from one of the five irrigation districts with the carbon tax at $30. Imagine what that is going to be when it goes much higher. That is money that is leaving our communities. The carbon tax and clean fuel standard costs are not rebated. This is going to be tough. These industries are supply chains within our own country that we are penalizing. That is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6503000">Let us look at something else that is having a problem. The agricultural chain is working, but vaccine supply is not working well. The supply chain on vaccines is problematic. Instead of supporting companies like Providence Therapeutics in Calgary, which contacted Health Canada numerous times and got crickets for answers, the government went to China to try to make a deal. We have supply chains that work in agriculture, but not in vaccines. We need this to work in our country. We need those vaccines built here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6503001">The last part of that is really interesting: The Liberals will not release the contracts. In other countries, the drug companies and governments have released those contracts to the public, but not in Canada. What are they hiding in those contracts that they do not want us to see? Again, if they had not gone to China, they could have done it here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6503002">The last thing I want to talk about is gun legislation. We had a tremendous private member's bill that would have penalized those people who were in possession of illegal guns. That was a great piece of legislation that dealt with the real issue of illegal guns and those who are using them. What did the government do when we brought that to a vote? It voted against it. It was a piece of legislation that would have made a difference right where the issue is, which is not with legal gun owners but with the people who have illegal guns and are committing the crimes. That is where we should have focused, but the current government did not support that bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6503009">I am very familiar with Team Canada. I have two former students who were Olympic athletes. I have been to the Olympics. I have been to Canada House. I have seen Team Canada and how it works, which is not like what we do. I appreciate what Team Canada is because I have seen it in motion at the Olympics and I know how it works. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6503010">I have one last thing on seniors. We have a tremendous number of seniors on fixed incomes. They are desperate. They write to me about what the carbon tax is adding to their costs. Their mental and physical health is deteriorating, and they identify those costs that are coming because of the carbon tax. That is a challenge for our seniors in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6503012">I am very proud of our government for having a minister of seniors. I get a chance to hear regularly from members of my community who are seniors and who are happy that we have started a ministry for seniors. We have more work to do, but we recognize that this extremely important segment of our population, who mean so much and who built this country, deserve to be taken care of in the best possible way by this government.</ParaText>
