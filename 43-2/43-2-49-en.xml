              <ParaText id="6463647">I am very pleased to speak to gun control, an issue that has broad consensus in Quebec. I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252915" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> for his work and for introducing this bill that seeks to amend the Criminal Code to imposes harsher sentences on those who unlawfully import firearms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463648">I will begin by sharing the Bloc Québécois' criticisms of Bill C-238. I will also take this opportunity to point out that the Liberal government made commitments to prohibit all military-style assault rifles, ban semi-automatic assault rifles and give municipalities the authority to ban handguns. Those commitments have been slow to materialize. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463649">It goes without saying that the Bloc Québécois supports stricter gun control, especially for handguns. The vast majority of Quebeckers agree. This bill needs to be studied in committee, but we do have some concerns, which I will come back to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463650">We all want to combat violence, and more specifically gun violence. Given the dire consequences, there is no excuse for the Canadian government's complacent attitude towards gun control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463651">I want to talk about a few deeply disturbing stories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463652">“A troubled, hate-filled young man was able to kill six people, seriously wound five and traumatize 25 others for life, including four children, in less than two minutes, because he had easy access to firearms. This is what someone armed with a Glock pistol and five 10-round magazines can do.” That is a quote from the co-founder of the Quebec City mosque, about the massacre that happened there on January 29, 2017. Everyone remembers that tragic day in Quebec's capital city. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463653">What we find so very upsetting is that the weapon used was acquired legally. The legal availability of handguns has not changed even though a September 2019 Angus Reid poll showed that 72% of Quebeckers want more restrictions on access to handguns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463654">There has been no progress despite the fact that seven out of 10 Canadians support a handgun ban. The federal government could have been expected to take this statistic more seriously. Moreover, there has been no progress despite Statistics Canada data showing that the number of gun homicides grew steadily from 2016 to 2019, an increase that closely tracked the dismantling of measures—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463662">Madam Speaker, there has been no progress despite data from Statistics Canada showing that the number of gun homicides increased every year between 2016 and 2019 and that this surge in homicides tracks closely with the Harper government's major dismantling of control measures starting in 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463663">In a letter sent to the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> in November 2019, relatives of victims of the shootings at the Polytechnique, Dawson College, and the Quebec City mosque, as well as the father of a police officer killed in the line of duty, unanimously called on the Liberal government to implement an immediate moratorium on the sale of assault weapons and a permanent ban on the importation and manufacture of handguns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463664">As members know, in August 2018, Montreal city council passed a motion calling on the federal government to ban assault weapons and handguns. The mayor of Montreal, Valérie Plante, stated at the time that approximately 30% of violent crimes committed between 2013 and 2016 involved a weapon and that two-thirds of these were handguns. Despite all these good reasons to take action to more broadly limit access to weapons, gun violence continues to be widespread on our streets. Bill C-238 specifically seeks to amend the Criminal Code to impose tougher penalties on those who illegally import firearms, with minimum sentences of three years for a first offence and five years or more for repeat offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463665">Increasing the length of minimum sentences is a good thing, but we are concerned that this will unfortunately not have a marked impact on the importation of illegal weapons. More importantly, we are concerned that it will not have a significant impact on reducing violence in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463666">The Conservatives' desire to address the issue of access to firearms is legitimate, but is it genuine? Unfortunately, history has shown us otherwise. My concern is that a bill like this one could be used as a justification for refusing to support broader restrictions on military-style assault weapons and handguns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463667">Although organized crime groups often use imported or stolen weapons, and I strongly believe we need to address this issue, a large number of violent crimes are committed with weapons that were legally imported or obtained, as was the case with the attacks at the Quebec City mosque, Dawson College, the former Métropolis and École Polytechnique in Montreal. At the end of the day, if we want to stop such massacres from happening, we need to ban handguns and military-style assault rifles, which exist only to kill human beings and have no place in our society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463668">How are they still allowed in this country? How have successive federal governments ignored calls from Quebeckers and Canadians to ban these weapons, which are designed to slaughter human beings and carry out unspeakable acts of violence? The government has made promises in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463669">In September 2019, the Prime Minister said that assault weapons, like the semi-automatic AR-15 rifles used in many massacres in recent years, would be banned if Canadians re-elected the Liberal Party. He also said that a Liberal government would work with the provinces to empower municipalities to ban handguns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463670">This is meant to be a cautious approach, but the government has yet to follow through. We have to wonder how cautious an approach can be if people continue to have access to such deadly weapons after Quebec and the rest of Canada have experienced— </ParaText>

Bill C-238 may not look like it would have a negative impact on efforts to control firearm usage, but it does not fix the problem. Sadly, it is not the answer we are seeking to a much bigger problem. The government cannot and must not allow itself to believe that this kind of measure counts as taking action on gun control. This measure is a sneaky and downright dishonest response to the pleas of thousands of families whose loved ones were collateral victims of shootings that have happened over the years in our communities, whether the weapons involved were legally imported or not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463683">Today I am here to specifically discuss the bill before us, which would amend section 96 of the Criminal Code to impose a mandatory sentence of three years for possession of a firearm known to be illegally imported to Canada, increase the maximum sentence from 10 to 14 years and a few other things. This is an offence that I agree should be taken very seriously. In fact, an amendment like this to the Criminal Code would be something I could discuss and agree to. However, this bill is written in a way that will lead it to follow the same path a similar bill did in 2013, and the Supreme Court of Canada ruled it unconstitutional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463684">I have worked with the House of Commons legislative team to write several pieces of legislation. This is a lot of hard work, and I know that the amazing folks here provide feedback about what will work and what may have some potential challenges for the legal system in Canada. I am very curious about why the member has brought forward legislation that is unconstitutional, when the need to bring forward laws to improve this gap is so very important. I am not interested in supporting legislation that will be defeated in the Supreme Court of Canada, cost a lot of taxpayer dollars and not support the safety of communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463685">Not too long ago, I met with a group of gun owners in my riding. It was a very informative meeting, and what I heard repeatedly were two main points: One, when we look at gun policy in Canada, we must have a renewed focus on keeping illegal guns out of our country; and two, we need more education in Canada about the strong rules we have around guns, which would allow people to better understand the rules and hopefully create a sense of increased safety. I will address both of these points today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463686">I agree that keeping illegal guns out of Canada must be something we see an increased investment in. Between 2011 and 2015, we saw the Canada Border Services Agency, the CBSA, under the previous Conservative government, cut over 1,000 positions. This is important because it has left a significant gap in the capacity of CBSA to do the work to reduce the number of guns being smuggled into Canada illegally. This concerns me greatly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463687">About two years ago, a constituent invited me to come to the shooting range with him in the riding. He wanted to showcase the rules and how he followed them. I agreed so that I could learn the realities of these folks in my region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463688">The first thing he told me was that I would have to come to his house to ride with him, as he could not stop his vehicle to pick me up with a gun in his vehicle. The rules in Canada meant that he had to go straight to the range. At his home, he showed me the way he stored his guns, separate from ammunition and with everything locked away. He also showed me how guns were safely transported. I learned a lot that day, and I really appreciate the time he took with me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463689">He also shared that he felt very concerned about gun violence in Canada. He knew that the things that had happened across our country, that had seen people killed and had brought fear to our communities, were very concerning and needed to be addressed in a meaningful way. He also felt that the majority of gun owners follow the rules very carefully. Figuring out how to identify the ones that did not and stopping the movement of illegal guns were his main priorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463690"> In 2018, our leader wrote a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> challenging the government to address the root causes of gun violence in our communities, the key things that really should be addressed in a meaningful way, such as poverty, substantive housing, and addressing people before they get to a place where violence has become an everyday reality. He also asked the PM to increase supports to the CBSA to give it the capacity to stem the illegal flow of guns from the United States into our country. What have Canadians seen? At this point, the Liberals have only returned 200 positions of the 1,000 the Conservatives cut. That is simply not enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463691">I also want to say that I agree with my constituents and the idea that Canadians need to better understand the rules legal gun owners follow in this country. A few years back, I took a course required for Canadians to receive their possession and acquisition licence. Sid Nielsen, a constituent of mine, has been teaching this course for many years and has done a fantastic job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463692">My classmates were a wide variety of people. I remember one in particular was a woman who had no plan to ever use a gun, but her husband owned several, and they wanted to make sure that, if anything happened to him, she could follow the rules of keeping the guns safe. I think this speaks to a really important point, which is that there are many important stories of how people are trying to be safe in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463693">It is time to take a stand that is meaningful. I hope this member takes the intent that I believe he meant and creates legislation that is actually constitutional, so we can start to address in a meaningful way how to stop illegal guns from coming into our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463694">I also hope to continue to push the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to make sure that our communities are safer and provide more resources where they are needed in the front lines to stop gun violence and also to make sure that we have more CBSA agents to stem the flow of illegal guns into Canada. Gun violence is very scary. I think when Canadians across this country look at some of the terrible realities we have faced, we want to make sure that the laws are there to protect us all. Let us work on that together.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6463695">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise and speak on Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code regarding the possession of unlawfully imported firearms. I would like to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252915" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, for his thoughtful and hard work on this critical issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463696">I am extremely proud to represent the people of South Surrey—White Rock and to call this beautiful part of our great nation my home, but despite the many great things about this vibrant, wholesome community, my constituents and I share a growing concern about gang-related gun violence on our streets. Over the holidays, tragedy struck our community and nearby. On December 28, Tequel Willis was shot eight times as he exited a taxi in Surrey. Tequel was 14 years old. He was pronounced dead on the scene. He is believed to be the youngest-ever victim of gang violence in B.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463697">A day earlier, emergency services responded to a call for help in Surrey and found 19-year-old Harman Singh Dhesi with gunshot wounds. He later died in hospital. Unfortunately, these are not isolated incidents. In a four-day stretch earlier this month, 28-year-old Dilraj Johal from Surrey was found dead with gunshot wounds in neighbouring Richmond; Anees Mohammed, 29, was shot and killed in Steveston Community Park, which is in a riding close to mine; and Gary Kang, 24, was gunned down in his parents' Surrey home, which is actually very close to where I live. Something needs to be done to address this grim reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463698">Our hard-working Canadian border agents who process around 100 million travellers annually have seized more than 4,200 guns at the border since 2014, but despite their best efforts, which I commend them for, experts believe many smuggled guns go undetected. While it is difficult to know exactly how many firearms get through customs illegally, some estimates suggest 70% or more of crime guns in Canada are smuggled in. We also know that two in five homicides committed in Canada in 2019 were committed with a firearm, 60% of which were handguns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463699">I am concerned not only because of the recent violence in my community, but also because my Lower Mainland riding shares a border with the United States. Along that border are two legal border crossings, Douglas and Pacific Highway. My community is also home to the Peace Arch Provincial Park, which runs along the border and allows visitors from both sides to visit without officially making entry into the neighbouring country. In addition to the southern border, B.C. shares a second border with Alaska, and the harbours along our Pacific coast receive international shipments every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463700">Our neighbours to the south are our closest allies, our biggest trading partner and, in many cases, our friends and family, but the fact remains that it is much easier to access guns south of the border and too many of those guns are winding up on Canadian soil. That is why I support my Conservative colleague's private member's bill to increase the penalties for the possession of unlawfully imported firearms. Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document> would address the problem in two ways: by increasing mandatory sentencing and making it more difficult for persons charged to be released on bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463701">Let us first consider the mandatory sentencing. If one is prosecuted by indictment, this bill would raise the minimum sentence for possessing an unlawfully imported firearm that the person knows was obtained by the commission of a crime from one to three years, and the maximum sentence from 10 years to 14 years. Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out six objectives for sentencing. The first three are (a) denouncing unlawful conduct, (b) deterring offenders and (c) separating offenders from society. The increased sentences under Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document> would accomplish all three. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463702">The longer sentences would make clear to all Canadians that the possession of a smuggled firearm is a serious offence that will not be tolerated, effectively denouncing the activity in the clearest of terms. The threat of an increased penalty would deter some criminals from possessing these smuggled arms. This deterrence, in effect, should also affect the supply chain. Less demand for smuggled guns should mean less smuggled guns in the first place. As for separating offenders from society, those convicted of this dangerous crime would be kept off the streets for longer, ensuring that they are unable to commit additional, potentially dangerous, crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463703">Last October, the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="252482" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> argued, as did the member for <Affiliation DbId="253014" Type="2">North Island—Powell River</Affiliation> today, that the mandatory minimums in this bill are unconstitutional. Both members pointed to the 2015 Supreme Court decision in R. v. Nur. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463704">In that case, the court struck down the minimum sentence for possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with access to ammunition, but the law in that case is distinguishable from the bill at hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463705">In Nur, Chief Justice McLachlin, writing for the majority, reasoned that the three-year minimum sentence for possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with access to ammunition violated section 12 of the charter as cruel and unusual punishment, because when applied not to the actual facts of that case but to reasonably foreseeable facts, the sentence would not fit the crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463706">One reasonably foreseeable scenario the court used as a hypothetical was “the licensed and responsible gun owner who stores his unloaded firearm safely with ammunition nearby, but makes a mistake as to where it can be stored.” The court explained that in this reasonably foreseeable hypothetical, the minimum sentence would be grossly disproportionate to the crime. According to the court, the “bottom line” was that the possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with access to ammunition offence “foreseeably catches licensing offences that involve little or no moral fault and little or no danger to the public. For these offences three years' imprisonment is grossly disproportionate to a fit and fair sentence.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463707">Clearly, the court's reasoning in Nur would not apply here. The possession of an illegal smuggled firearm that the accused knows was obtained through crime is not a mere licensing offence involving no moral fault or danger to the public. There is no reasonably foreseeable scenario in which someone, by licensing error or otherwise, accidentally violates the law against possession of a smuggled firearm that they knew was illegally obtained. To the contrary, these are guns that are bought and sold on the black market with their serial numbers shaved off, used in the commission of dangerous crimes. The mandatory minimums in the bill, I believe, are both constitutional and warranted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463708">The bill would also subject those charged with possession of a smuggled firearm to reverse-onus bail. For most crimes, the onus at the bail hearing is on the prosecution to show why the accused should be detained. However, subsection 515(6) would provide that for several enumerated crimes, this onus would be reversed, and instead the accused would have to show why they should be released. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463709">Under the current scheme, several firearm-related offences already call for reverse-onus bail. This includes weapons trafficking and possession for purposes of weapons trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463710">As mentioned earlier, my community has recently experienced a spike in gun violence, with victims tragically as young as 14 years old. As a member of Parliament and mother, I have no higher moral obligation than the need to keep our children and communities safe. Simply put, this bill would make my community and many like it across Canada safer places to live. That is why I support Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document> and urge other members to do the same.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463711">Madam Speaker, happy new year to you and to all my colleagues joining us virtually from around the country. It is a pleasure to see everyone and to reconnect in this format.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463712">I am pleased to speak today on Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document>, which was introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252915" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> in February of last year and would propose to amend the Criminal Code, as we have heard throughout the discussions this morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463713">First of all, I applaud the laudable objective of curbing illegal gun activity and I appreciate that the sponsor sees these measures as important for targeting organized criminal activity. Violence through firearms poses a real and significant public safety risk to many communities, including those that have experienced mass shootings. Nevertheless, I am of the view that this bill should not be supported, and I will explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463714">The government has repeatedly acknowledged that gun violence and gun crime is an increasing problem in Canadian society that needs to be addressed with a comprehensive strategy. This was recently reiterated in the Speech from the Throne in September of 2020. That is why the mandate letters of the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> have committed to the implementation of a robust set of firearms amendments, including the imposition of stronger penalties for gun smuggling. It is also why the government has already taken concrete steps to curb firearms violence, including the May 1, 2020, prohibition on military-style assault rifles with a two-year Criminal Code amnesty and a buyback program.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6463715">On May 1, 2020, the government delivered on its commitment regarding military-style assault weapons by implementing a regulation banning 1,500 models of assault-style firearms that pose a significant threat to public safety and are not necessary for hunting or sport shooting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463716">The government also issued an order to give law-abiding firearms owners a two-year amnesty period to protect them from criminal liability while they take steps to comply with the act. By so doing, the government was clear: It took measures to enhance public safety while reducing unnecessary risk for the public. As part of these measures, the government also sought to guarantee that law-abiding firearms owners would not be punished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463717">I strongly believe that this balanced and comprehensive approach is preferable to the narrower approach proposed by the bill. The illegal firearms market in Canada is primarily supplied by smuggled firearms or firearms stolen from private residents or commercial establishments. Given its proximity to Canada, the United States is the primary source of firearms for Canada, particularly handguns smuggled into Canada. The majority of illegal firearms in the U.S. originate in the U.S., but may occasionally come from other countries, such as Canada.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6463718">Reducing firearms smuggling into Canada is a key part in the fight to reduce access to illegal firearms in this country. Smuggled firearms that make their way into communities are a serious public safety issue and can be used to commit serious offences tied to organized crime. Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document> proposes to increase the maximum penalty and the mandatory minimum penalty of imprisonment for the possession of a smuggled firearm, prohibited weapon or other object. Bill C-238 would also impose a reverse onus on an accused in an application for judicial interim release, more commonly known as bail, when the accused is charged with the possession of a smuggled weapon. This means that unless the accused can demonstrate why their pretrial detention was not justified, they would remain in custody pending trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463719">While the objectives of the private member's bill are well intentioned in that they propose to address firearms crime among other things, the government does not support the bill, as it raises serious legal and policy concerns, some of which have been addressed by earlier speakers. Given the scope of the offence, I am very concerned that the increased mandatory minimum penalties would lead to significant charter scrutiny, but just as important, mandatory minimum penalties generally produce system inefficiencies and delays in the criminal justice system. They are also known to have disproportionately negative impacts on indigenous peoples, Black and other visible minority Canadians, something that should be of key concern to all parliamentarians as we confront and seek to address the systemic racism that is pernicious in the criminal justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463720">In addition, the reverse onus would be novel in the current bail regime and would treat accused persons charged with the same offence differently, depending on how the possessed firearm was illegally obtained. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463721">The government has been in the process of considering these important issues for quite some time. In October of 2018, the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> began a series of consultations with Canadians on the issue of handguns and assault-style firearms. The consultations included eight in-person round tables with 77 stakeholders' written submissions, and almost 135,000 Canadians responded to an online questionnaire. The summary report published on April 11, 2019, indicated that Canadians believe that a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach is needed to combat firearms violence in Canada. Of note, firearms smuggling and border security were identified as among the most prominent concerns of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6463722">The government has comprehensively set out a path forward to address gun violence, including banning assault-style firearms, providing an amnesty period and a firearms buy-back program, and working with provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict or ban handguns. The government has taken other measures, such as the establishment of reporting legislation or a type of red alert to make it easier to remove firearms from people who pose a danger to themselves or others, and measures to combat gun smuggling and trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463723">Recently, in the Speech from the Throne of September 23, 2020, the government reiterated its commitment to combat firearms smuggling.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6463724">When the <Affiliation DbId="253386" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> announced the ban, he also announced that the government would be introducing other measures to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals, including increasing safe storage requirements and strengthening the law around firearms smuggling and trafficking. The government has made funding of up to $327 million available over five years through the initiative to take action against gun and gang violence, combat gun-related violence and gang activities, including by supporting law enforcement in community-led projects focused on prevention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463725">It is my understanding that more than $200 million is now flowing directly to the provinces and territories to target initiatives that best meet the unique needs of individual communities to advance efforts in the areas of prevention, gang exit, outreach and awareness training, as well as enhanced intelligence sharing and law enforcement capacity. With the funding allocations, jurisdictions have made investments to support new law enforcement activities, including specialized training and education initiatives and improving data collection and information sharing.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6463726">As far as reducing gun violence is concerned, the government knows that a comprehensive approach must also include measures to remove from the market guns that present the biggest danger to public safety, as well as a combination of measures on the criminal use of firearms, including preventive measures and law enforcement, as well as harsher sentences.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6463727">Although the laudable objectives of this bill may be well-intentioned, I remain of the view that a more comprehensive approach, with the benefit of parliamentary review and debate in both Houses, would be the more appropriate course of action.

              <ParaText id="6463729">I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code with regard to possession of unlawfully imported firearms, a bill that would put the criminals using smuggled guns behind bars for longer and make communities safer by raising the standards on dangerous criminals being released on bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463730">This is a bill that all GTA residents need and have been calling for. The numbers do not lie. Since 2015, gun violence has grown in Toronto. In 2018, there were record high numbers of deaths. In 2019, there were record high numbers of shootings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463731">The year 2020 should have been different, as COVID-19 forced people to work from home, and millions of GTA residents changed their routines. The active nightlife, festivals and events were all cancelled. Once very busy streets were now ghost towns. However, that did not stop the violence at all. In 2020, even with a worldwide pandemic, there were over 450 shootings and 40 deaths. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463732">Gun violence has become all too common in places that used to be considered safe. The stories of people waking up to gunshots or being called about loved ones' deaths are heartbreaking. Those people have been promised action but have not seen any results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463733">I believe the Liberal government has approached this issue in the wrong way. It has focused on gun bans. For its plan to work, violent criminals would have to suddenly start following the law. We know that criminals are not getting a licence to buy firearms that would require taking a course and having a background check. Criminals are buying smuggled guns, just like they are buying smuggled drugs. A gun ban would do little, if anything, to stop them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463734">The former chief of police of Toronto stated that 82% of handguns used in crimes are smuggled in from the United States. The Ontario solicitor general put the numbers at 84%. More recently, Peel Regional Police reported that 74% of the guns they seized were from south of the border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463735">The problem is not just smuggled guns; it is also about how we treat criminals who are caught with these guns. The truth is that when they are arrested, they are released on bail within days. They can have a smuggled gun back in their possession within hours. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463736">We need to target the criminals using these guns. Criminals need to know that the use of smuggled guns is a serious offence and that they will do real time behind bars if they are caught. As I have said before, there is no excuse for criminals to have these weapons. If someone has a smuggled gun, they are a real threat to public safety. When they are arrested, neighbours do not want them to get out on bail. The former chief of police reported that criminals getting arrested and being released on bail is far too common.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463737"> No one bill will stop the gun violence in Canada, but Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document> is an excellent first step to making my riding of Markham—Unionville and all Canadians safer. I encourage every member to vote for this bill. It would keep dangerous criminals off the streets and save lives. If there are any concerns regarding Bill <Document DbId="10866292" Type="4">C-238</Document>, they can best be handled in committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463747">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak on behalf of the residents of my riding of Davenport, whom I am honoured and blessed to represent in this venerable House on Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463748">I will be speaking specifically to some of the important measures that are included in Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14, an act to implement certain provisions of the economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 30, 2020 and other measures</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463749">Since the onset of COVID-19, the Government of Canada has remained steadfast in its commitment to do whatever it takes to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to help Canadian businesses weather the storm. The recently tabled fall economic statement outlined the government's actions to date and proposed new measures to support Canadians through the COVID-19 pandemic. These investments are a down payment on a growth plan of roughly 3%-4% of GDP, or between $70 billion and $100 billion over three years, to jump-start Canada's economy once the virus is under control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463750">Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> is an important step in the government's plan. It would urgently move forward with measures from the fall economic statement that would provide immediate assistance to families with young children, students and businesses, and measures that would help protect the health and safety of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463751">For example, the bill would ensure that Canadians whose Canada emergency response benefit claim has been delayed could receive the income support that they are eligible for after the end of this year. This bill would also amend the Food and Drugs Act to help prevent and alleviate future drug shortages by allowing the government to make regulations to require that pertinent information on potential shortages and activities related to food, drugs and other items be provided to the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, when necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463752">The fall economic statement also moves forward with a plan to set new national standards for long-term care, in recognition of the tragic deaths from COVID-19 that we saw in the spring, in the fall and right now. It seeks to establish a $1 billion safe long-term care fund that would help provinces and territories protect seniors and our most vulnerable. In particular, Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> would provide funding of up to $505.7 million over the coming months to support long-term care facilities, including funding to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection, outbreaks and deaths in supportive-care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463753">Our federal government also recognizes that the emotional and mental health effects of the pandemic on Canadians will continue as we face the second wave and public health measures continue to be in place. Indeed, half of Canadians report that their mental health has worsened during COVID-19. Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> would provide funding to improve vital access to virtual care and mental health tools. This would include important investments to bolster distress centres and provide further support for the Wellness Together Canada portal, which connects Canadians to peer-support workers, social workers, psychologists and other professionals to help address mental health and substance use issues. These investments would help ensure that Canadians have the mental health support they need when they need it the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463754">In addition to the $505.7 million for long-term care, this bill would provide funding of up to $395.6 million to support a range of initiatives to help Canadians cope during the pandemic and to continue our fight against the virus, including the following: mental health and substance use programming, innovative approaches to COVID-19 testing, virtual care and mental health tools, medical research, treatments and therapeutics, vaccine funding and development, border and travel measures, and isolation sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463755">As the members of the House know well, the spring saw many challenges, as everything shut down across the country to reduce the spread of the virus. Suddenly, kids were out of school, day cares were closed and many families with young children had to find temporary alternatives to their regular child care arrangements. These challenges often meant higher, unanticipated costs for Canadian families with children.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463756">Our federal government is committed to helping the many families who have been struggling with a wide range of expenses as a result, from providing care to buying tools for at-home learning, such as books and computers, and often more costly temporary child care arrangements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463757">That is why the federal government is proposing, through Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, to provide immediate relief for low- and middle-income families with young children who are entitled to the Canada child benefit or CCB. For these families, we are proposing to provide up to $1,200 in 2021 for each child under the age of six. This would represent an almost 20% increase over the existing maximum annual CCB payment and would have a meaningful impact on families in need of this support during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463758">This support would automatically be delivered to families who are entitled to the CCB, and have a net income at or below $120,000, through four tax-free payments of $300. Families entitled to the CCB who have a net income above $120,000 would receive four tax-free payments of $150, for a total benefit of $600. The first of these payments would be made within a week or two of the passage of Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, as I understand, with subsequent payments occurring in April, July and October of 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463759">This temporary assistance would directly benefit about 1.6 million families and about 2.1 million children during a period when families are still grappling with the financial impacts they are facing as a result of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463760">We must also recognize how young people continue to suffer from economic impacts due to COVID-19. When the pandemic struck, many students had to leave school. Internships and summer jobs became scarce as Canadians did the right thing and stayed at home. The government is working to ensure that the pandemic does not derail the futures of students. We are determined to take a number of measures to help youth continue in their careers and in their schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463761">In addition to proposed measures from the fall economic statement that would provide more opportunities for young people to gain work experience, our government is also proposing support to ease the financial burden on recent graduates. This important measure, which has received praise from the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, would bring $329.4 million in relief to up to 1.4 million Canadians who are looking for work or are in the early stages of their careers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463762">It would also help graduates from low- and middle-income families, who tend to have higher overall debt levels, as well as recent graduates with disabilities, given that 37% of borrowers who identified as a person with disabilities participated in the repayment assistance plan of the Canada student loans program in 2017-18.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463763">In conclusion, it is clear that Canadians need our support to weather the storm as we continue to fight against COVID-19. That is why I implore all hon. members to join me in swiftly passing Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> to enable the government to move forward with implementing these important measures from the fall economic statement, to protect the health and safety of Canadians, to support students and recent graduates, and to help families with young children in need.</ParaText>

We are not going to be able to move forward into a strong economic recovery otherwise. If we did not spend this investment, we would not be able to move forward and restart our economy in a successful way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463775">My question is very simple. Why are the supports so small for families that are really struggling to make ends meet through this pandemic? Why has the government not actually put into place recommendations that have come from child care advocates across the country to invest vigorously and robustly $2 billion into helping to build the foundation for a national child care system?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463777">I think the hon. member knows that we have spent almost $400 billion in supports to help not only Canadian families and workers, but also businesses through this pandemic. The measure that he is referring to is with regard to the additional dollars we are providing, totalling up to $1,200 for each child under the age of six, for the next year. It represents a 20% increase over the maximum annual CCB payment. This is to provide some additional support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463778">If I can go through the $381 billion we have already spent and the amount of money we have set aside for child care to support families in a number of different ways, the government has shown time and time again that we will step up when we need to. We will be there for families. We will have the backs of families. If this is not enough, then we will come back with even more funding and more supports as time goes on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463779">Madam Speaker, I really hope we can get the issue in Zoom resolved as soon as possible so members have the opportunity to raise their hands virtually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463780">It is great to be back in the House after our recess. We have important work to continue to do on behalf of Canadians. I am very much looking forward to being part of that. It is good to see my colleagues again, in person and virtually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463781">My remarks today touch primarily on three issues: long-term care, child care supports for Canadians and the supports we have seen to provincial and territorial partners throughout this pandemic as well as what we should anticipate from this government moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463782">First, I want to acknowledge the fact this has been a very difficult year for Canadians right across the country. Indeed, it is going to be difficult throughout the winter as well. People are making tough decisions right now about what they need to do to get through this pandemic. To understand and know that we are all in this together and that their federal government is there to support them I think is reassuring for many Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463783">As we get through this, I really hope we quickly see things start to get better now that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, with the vaccines being distributed not just in our country but indeed throughout the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463784">I want to talk about long-term care and other supportive care facilities and how this government has been responding to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463785">We know the majority of people who had fallen quite ill and passed away as a result of COVID-19 were residents of long-term care facilities. One of the most alarming issues for me when I started to see data coming out of these facilities back in the spring, summer and into the fall was the disconnect between the different levels of long-term care facilities and how successful they were at containing the virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463786">We have discovered in Ontario that there are three different levels of long-term care facilities: those owned by municipalities, and in Ontario each municipality is required to own at least one long-term care facility; not-for-profit long-term care facilities; and for-profit facilities. Those that were owned by municipalities did a much better job of containing COVID. Those that were not-for-profit long-term care facilities did almost as good as the municipalities. Unfortunately the for-profit long-term care facilities seemed to have the most fatalities and number of outbreaks and, as a result, saw the most strain. That is not to say that all for-profit long-term care facilities are going to experience these larger problems. Many out there have done things very effectively and should be complimented on that. However, many, unfortunately, were not as successful. Therefore, we have to get to the root of why that happened and why there are gaps, in particular, in the standards of care for our most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463787">Since the beginning, this government has worked with the provinces and territories to fight the outbreaks in long-term care homes. For example, it helped provide PPE, contact tracing and direct assistance through the Canadian Red Cross. Despite the fact long-term care facilities are regulated by the provinces, the federal government acknowledged it had a lead role to play in helping the provinces get through it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463788"> Therefore, the government proposed investments in the fall economic statement, such as: $1 billion allocated to establish a safe long-term care fund that will help provinces and territories protect people in long-term care and support infection, prevention and control; $6 million over two years to the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement to expand its long-term care initiative; $1 million to engage with third parties to help identify resources to conduct readiness assessments in long-term care facilities and facilitate training on infection, prevention and control; and $2.4 million over three years for Health Canada to increase its capacity to be able to support and undertake policy initiatives, as was the commitment in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463789">In the Speech from the Throne, the government indicated that it wanted to move toward developing national standards when it came to long-term care. This is not to say that the federal government wants to impede on the jurisdiction of provinces, but as with other legislation, like the building code, the federal government sees a role in helping to establish some of those objectives and standards that exist so they can be adopted across the country if provinces and territories see the need to adopt them. As we have seen with the national building code, most provinces have adopted it. My understanding is that only two provinces in the country, Ontario and Quebec, have their own building codes. Therefore, national standards, although not to be imposed upon provinces, can be there for provinces to use as a resource in order to establish best practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463790">The other item I will talk about, as I indicated earlier, is with respect to early childhood learning and child care. We know that this pandemic has created very difficult and challenging times for child care providers. Indeed, their jobs are much more difficult than they were before. It has made the work of over 200,000 early childhood educators and child care workers across the country uncertain. People are uncertain about their jobs and what the child care system will look like moving forward. Now is the time to make long-term, sustained investments so every Canadian family has access to affordable, high-quality child care for their children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463791">In the fall economic statement, a first step laid the groundwork for a Canada-wide child care system in partnership with our provinces and territories, which ultimately take the lead on this very important issue. Also being proposed are investments in 2021-22 of $420 million for provinces and territories to attract and retain early childhood educators. There is a growing need for childhood educators. There is uncertainty. The government sees a role in providing that certainty and ensuring that Canadians who are interested in early childhood education see that there will be work for them as we come through this pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463792">Finally, I want to talk about the supports for provinces and territories. Quite a bit has been said over the last year about supports. I am extremely proud to be part of a government that has been there for Canadians through supporting our provinces, but it has not ended and it will not end yet. For 2020-21, $85 billion of support has been provided to provinces and territories throughout the country, and there is more to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463793">What is being proposed with respect to the fiscal stabilization program is indexing the payment of $60 per capita, which was set out in 1987, to a total economic growth per person of $170 per person, which is nearly triple. The capital continues to grow with economic growth per person in future years. The higher cap will apply to claims for 2019-20 and onward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463794">This federal government has been there for Canadians directly through programs like the CERB and various other programs throughout this pandemic. It has been there to support provinces and territories by giving them the resources they need to successfully take care of Canadians. Indeed, it is there to ensure they can help develop policy to make a better Canada, a Canada that has quality of life moving forward. As we come out of this, we need to learn from things such as what has been happening in long-term care facilities to ensure we develop policies that will improve the quality of life for everybody.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6463810">Madam Speaker, if this pandemic has taught us anything, it is to be prepared for the unexpected, to anticipate risks before they metastasize so that we can protect ourselves and secure our future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463811">Today, I rise in the House of Commons to draw the attention of members to a growing risk of danger to our families, our businesses and our entire country. It is the risk of the $8.6 trillion of household, corporate and government debt that is quickly accumulating on the shoulders of Canadians. This amount equals 387% of our GDP, a record ratio that is higher than the ratios in many countries that have in the past experienced devastating debt crises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463812">Before our eyes glaze over, though, I want to remind members that a debt crisis is not just something that bankers and financial analysts talk about in the Report on Business from The Globe and Mail or on BNN. Research by reputable academic institutions shows that in the case of a financial crisis, house prices can drop by a third; stock markets, meaning people's savings, can drop by half; the economy can drop by 9%; and unemployment can rise seven percentage points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463813">Here is the human toll of that. The University of Calgary published a study recently showing that there is a two percentage point increase in suicides for every one percentage point increase in unemployment. Imagine the human cost of 7% unemployment. More data is now showing an inextricable link between opioid abuse and unemployment. Depression and homelessness result from these types of crises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463814">What is the nature of the risk? How serious is it? How likely are we to face it? We have to look to history. In their now-legendary book <I>This Time is Different</I>, Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Professor Ken Rogoff wrote about what they call eight centuries of folly. They studied debt crises in 66 countries across five continents. As they write in their opening, “Each time, the experts have chimed, ‘this time is different’—claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters.” With this breakthrough study, they found definitively that experts are wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463815">They lay out five standard leading indicators for a forthcoming financial crisis. I will go through them very quickly: first, falling economic output; second, a large debt buildup; third, rising household leverage; fourth, asset inflation; and fifth, large current account deficits. Do these five standard leading indicators apply to us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463816">Let us start with the first one: falling output. Last year, in 2020, our GDP dropped 5.5%, blowing a more than $100 billion hole in our economy. That is a massive reduction in our economy, and it means that we have $100 billion less to service our debts. On the first test, from <I>This Time is Different</I>, we do have falling economic output. It does not matter who is to blame. It does not matter that it was COVID that caused it. What matters is the math, and the math does not lie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463817">Let us move on to the second standard leading indicator: debt buildup. The amount of debt that a country can shoulder depends on the income that it produces to service that debt. According to the great Canadian economist John Kenneth Galbraith, “All crises have involved debt that, in one fashion or another, has become dangerously out of scale in relation to the underlying means of payment.” That underlying means of payment, of course, is GDP, so let us look at the size of our debt and how much it has grown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463818">Since the beginning of 2015, our total debt, public and private, has gone from $6.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a nearly 40% increase in our debt. During that time, our GDP has only grown by 13%.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463819">In other words, our debt levels are growing almost three times as fast as our GDP, the underlying means of payment. We have now reached a level of debt to GDP of 387%, as I said earlier, but I did not tell you that it is an all-time record and nearly twice the size of the typical ratio over the last 60 years in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463820">Here is some more staggering information: The debt-to-GDP ratio of Greece when it had its massive sovereign debt crisis 10 years ago was 330%. In the United States, during the great financial crisis that came out of the mortgage bubble, their debt was 375% of GDP. In other words, our debt levels in Canada today are higher than they were in the United States and Greece when they had massive, iconic and devastating debt crises in the recent past. Therefore, we need now to pay heed as to why we think we can avoid the same thing. The only difference between them then and us now is that interest rates are low, but they will not stay that way forever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463821">What is the composition of our debt? Where does it come from? The answer is threefold: it is government, corporate and household debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463822">Let us start with government debt. This year for the first time on record, Statistics Canada shows that the gross debt of all levels of government in Canada is bigger than the GDP. It just exceeded 100%, 100.3%, to be precise, in the third quarter of 2020. That has never happened before. Our debt levels are higher than they were in the 1990s when we had our own miniature near default of the federal government. That time it was 92%, so our debt levels are higher than ever before when it comes to government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463823">Before the government rises to claim that we have the lowest debt in the G7, as a share of GDP, that is just wrong. The only reason that Finance Canada calculates it that way is that uses the assets of the CPP and the QPP to deduct from our overall net debt level without using the corresponding liabilities those funds must pay. As a result, if one were to ignore that and look at our gross debt, we have higher debt levels than both Germany and, I believe, France in the G7. That means we do not have the lowest debt levels in the G7 and cannot be worry-free and fool ourselves that our sustained buildup of government debt is not a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463824">This year has seen a spectacular and never-before-seen increase in that debt. Our fiscal deficit is $381 billion. That is almost seven times bigger than the previous all-time average and equals 17% of our GDP. Let us put that into perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463825"> In World War I, our deficit-to-GDP ratio was 8%. In the Great Depression, it was 6%. In the great global recession it was 4%. In other words, our deficit as a share of the economy and adjusted for inflation is currently twice what it was at its peak in World War I, three times what it was at its peak in the Great Depression and four times what it was in the great global recession. Only in the Second World War was it bigger, and our ancestors, when they came back from the war, immediately began repaying that debt, running the biggest surpluses ever in 1947, and then increasing the size of our economy elevenfold in the two-and-a-half decades that followed, which allowed them to pay it off quickly. Nobody is suggesting that we will come anywhere near to those kinds of surpluses or growth rates in the post-COVID era, which means that our debt situation is arguably more ominous for the country than it was even back then. Thus, on that criterion, the second standard leading indicator of a sustained buildup of debt, Canada meets that criterion as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463826">We move on to household debt levels. Canada has the highest level of household debt as a ratio of disposable income in the G7. In fact, recently, our level of household debt grew to bigger than the entire Canadian economy, again setting records. These ratios mean that our households are carrying more debt than our economy can reasonably be expected to support.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463827">According to the president and CEO of CMHC, “Canadians are among world leaders in household debt. Pre-COVID, the ratio of ... debt to GDP for Canada was at 99 per cent.... These ratios are well in excess of the 80 per cent threshold above which the Bank of International Settlements has shown that national debt intensifies the drag on GDP growth.” In other words, an international body like the Bank for International Settlements says that countries should not go above 80%, and yet pre-COVID we were at nearly 100%. Since that time, debt levels have risen even higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463828">That is the third criterion for a forthcoming debt crisis, rising household leverage. Now we move onto the next one, which is asset inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463829">In Canada today, the assets that Canadians own in the country are worth 17 times the size of the Canadian economy. The historic average is 12 times. In other words, our asset values are quickly outpacing our economy. That cannot go on for long, because, of course, assets can only be purchased out of the income generated in the economy. Those assets break down into two parts: financial assets and real estate assets, more or less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463830">With financial assets, we look at the S&amp;P/TSX, the broadest index in the country. Until a few years ago, the market value of that index had never exceeded the size of our economy. It was always smaller than GDP. That changed in the last 24 months, and has suddenly rocketed up to 120%, according to Rosenberg Research, a leading economic research firm. That one index is now worth 120% of GDP. That has never happened before. The companies in that index need to generate their profits from the economy, and therefore the value of the stocks on the index cannot get completely out of touch with the ability of the economy to generate income and support those stock prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463831">Then we move on to real estate, where prices are up $65,000 this year. Can members imagine that in a year when our economy has lost over $100 billion in economic output and hundreds of thousands of people have lost their paycheques and been forced into their homes that somehow we found all of this money to buy real estate? In fact, from the beginning of 2019 to mid-2020, the inflation of our assets in this country has been worth more than our entire economy. There has been $2.7 trillion of asset inflation in an economy worth just over $2 trillion. That would be like someone making more money every year from the appreciation of their house than the salary they take home from work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463832">It would be nice if it could happen forever and we could simply float on a bubble up to prosperity, but we know that in the end our assets are only worth what we can afford to pay for them. Can Canadians afford the real estate they have right now? Members can ask RBC and the CMHC. The CMHC says that for a home to be affordable for a family, the family should not have to spend more than 30% of its income on housing. According to RBC, the average right now is 50%. That means that for the average person to afford the average house, 20 percentage points more from their family budgets has to go to housing. That is with record low interest rates. When rates rise, those payments will only become more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463833">Do we have asset inflation in Canada? We have it like we have perhaps never seen before. Asset inflation is the fourth leading indicator of a forthcoming debt crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463834">This brings us to the final leading indicator that these Harvard economists developed through studying 800 years of history of debt crises, which is current account deficits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463835">To oversimplify this for the purpose of saving us some time, current account deficits are basically the amounts someone buys in excess of what they sell. In essence, Canada buys imports and sells exports. The truth is that we buy a lot more from the rest of the world than we sell to it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463836">Since 2015 to the present, Canada has run current account deficits of approximately $300 billion. In other words, we bought $300 billion more from the world than we sold to it, and we borrowed to make up the difference. How else would we do it? If we buy more than we are selling, there are only two ways to do it: we drain our savings or we rack up debt. We have been doing a little of both, but most of all, we have been adding debt. The result is that we are taking on more and more obligations for our prior consumption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463837">I would like to say that all of this debt has been used to invest in productive assets like factories, software, patents and other things that will generate income to pay off that debt, but the evidence shows that the overwhelming preponderance of the new debt has been going to immediate consumption. In fact, data from after the government's programs came in, programs that I believe were meritorious and had to happen, showed that much of the money leaked out of the country because, as Canadians, we were all buying or importing things from abroad more than we were producing and sending abroad. That means that last year we were again running a large trade deficit and adding to our overall debt load in the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463838">In the months of April and May 2020, Canadians borrowed an extra $80 billion from foreigners according to David Dodge, who published a recent piece on this for the Public Policy Forum. He specifically asked how long it will be possible for Canadians, for our country, to borrow from the world in order to buy from the world before the world gets tired of lending us money. The bottom line is that we have a large and consistent current account deficit, the second-largest in the G7, second only to Japan's. That is an unavoidable problem that we will need to confront, because the world is not going to view our economy as a charity case. The lenders of the world will expect to be paid interest on all of the debt that we carry forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463839">In fact, the only way to pay off that debt is to generate powerful incomes. Unfortunately, since 2012 Canada has exported more investment than it has brought in by a net amount of $800 billion. In other words, we are sending our investment to productive assets in other parts of the world, while they are sending us debt. They get factories, software, patents or pipelines, and we get large-scale debt. That is the fifth measurement of whether or not a debt crisis will strike, and we can say definitively that with our $300 billion in current account deficits in the last five years, Canada indeed meets this standard leading indicator that is necessary to trigger a debt crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463840">There are five indicators, and we check every single box. What can we do about it? The answer is that we need to unleash the power of our productive economy to clear the way for job creation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463841">This is red tape week. Let us eliminate the red tape that prevents businesses from hiring. Let us approve large-scale projects like the Teck Frontier mine in Alberta, or the LNG facility in Saguenay. These are tens of billions of dollars in economic activity. Let us make this the fastest place in the world to get a construction permit. Right now we rank 34th out of 35 OECD nations on that. Let us be the fastest place to build a factory or build a pipeline or some other economic infrastructure that pays wages and can reimburse our debts and support our prosperity. Let us change the tax and regulatory rules that get in the way of first nation communities trying to develop commerce and resources on their reserves. Let us remove the penalties for low-income people to get off social assistance so that they can get back to work. Let us allow our newcomers as immigrants use their qualifications by giving them permits to work in fields they are qualified in, like the professions and the trades. Let us replace what has become a credit card economy with a paycheque economy, and in that way alone, we will secure our future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463850">Madam Speaker, the member asked what we would have done differently. First, we would not have gone into this crisis having already added $100 billion of debt before the very first case of COVID-19. That is the first thing. The Liberal government inherited a balanced budget and blew through $100 billion of debt before COVID-19 even arrived on the scene.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463851">Second, we would have ensured that the COVID crisis would not have spun out of control here in Canada the way it did, because we would have closed the border. We told the Liberals and we are on the record as saying we would have closed the border. They had military intelligence in December telling them of the risk, yet they let 60,000 people come into this country from China between December and March, causing the disease to spread quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463852">We would have approved rapid testing more quickly so that Canadians could get back into their jobs safely. We would have procured vaccines on a priority basis, rather than leaving us at the back of the pack. All of these things would have saved a fortune.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463853">Finally, what would we do differently going forward? When we come out of the COVID crisis, we would unleash the engine of free market productive economic growth that produces paycheques for people, rather than shutting down the economy by blocking enterprises, as the Liberal government has done in project after project. We also reject their proposal to make all the COVID spending permanent. In this bill, they have asked for an increase in the debt limit of another $700 billion. That is irresponsible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463861">Madam Speaker, first, that is a complete falsehood. Conservatives have spoken out against corporate welfare. We were the first party to stand in the House and insist that the wage subsidy not go to paying dividends. I warned, on the floor of this House of Commons, the then finance minister, Bill Morneau, that if he did not ban it, corporations would use the wage subsidy to pay dividends to executives and wealthy shareholders. He ignored me, and that is exactly what they did. We, on this side, were the ones who spoke out against it. We are the party that opposes corporate welfare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463862">However, the member asked about these tax revenues that they want to generate by closing loopholes and shutting down, as we call them in French, the “<I>paradis fiscaux</I>”. Of course we agree that everybody should pay their own fair share, but I find that when these left-wing governments take office, although they always claim that rich people will pay, rich people never end up paying, and it ends it being the middle class and the working people who get the full bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463863">The current government cannot produce a single, solitary shred of evidence that it is raising any new money from the rich.

              <ParaText id="6463869">That is a good question, Madam Speaker. The reality is we have to secure the future by moving to a paycheque economy from a credit card economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463870"> The credit card economy that the government wants to create would permanently lock in annual spending increases forever and add another $600 billion of debt. That is what the Liberals are seeking authorization for in this bill: to raise the national debt to $1.8 trillion. That is the credit card economy. It only ends in tears.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463871">The paycheque economy is one in which we unleash the power of enterprise to build pipelines so that the steelworkers in the member's riding can actually get jobs making the steel that goes into that pipe and the energy sector workers can get full global prices for their oil, rather than letting the Americans continue to rip us off. It means unleashing the construction of the Teck Frontier mine, for which the permit could still be approved, or expediting the approval of the LNG, a $14-billion project in Saguenay that could put thousands of Quebeckers permanently to work exporting clean, green Canadian natural gas that will lower global emissions by displacing dirty foreign coal. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463878">Madam Speaker, Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which we are reviewing today, appears to build on certain measures in the economic statement the government released last November. It is very troubling, however, that, like the economic statement, this bill does not address glaring needs such as increased health care transfers and financial assistance for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463879">There is no picture or sound, despite the fact that this unprecedented health crisis, which is turning Canadians' lives upside down, requires a strong signal from the government. “We are there for Canadians.” “We will always be there for Canadians.” These are statements we recognize and that are familiar to us, because they have been repeated so often by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are just words, however; not actions. What is missing is a concrete, tangible vision to get us through this second wave and help us address the economic recovery in the near future. What is the plan?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463880">In terms of health, we can only repeat that the most important, most sensitive, most useful and most constructive help we could give the provinces and territories would be a tangible and significant increase in Canada health transfers. This increase should reduce the gap between the federal government's contribution and the provinces' contribution to health care, which is growing year by year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463881">In 2019, Quebec, the other provinces and the territories funded 40% of all health care expenditures, while the Canadian government funded only 22%. According to Conference Board of Canada data, based on the current growth rate, the federal contribution to health care will drop to below 20% by 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463882">It does not take a mathematician to understand that this recurrent deficit has a considerable impact on the provinces' ability to support and strengthen their health care systems. The federal government will probably once again tell us that it is there to support the provinces and that it has injected $19 billion, but we all know that the problem is that these amounts are not recurring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463883">If the government was really listening to and hearing the provinces and Quebec, it would know that they need security and predictability, not conditional piecemeal investments based on the mood of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463884">Must I remind you that thousands of front-line workers have been fighting the pandemic every day, day after day, for 11 months?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463885">What do they need? They need us to recognize their work and support them in their efforts to treat people and save lives. How can we do that? By granting the federal transfers demanded by those who have the expertise and the responsibility for the organization and delivery of health care: the provincial governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463886">These workers really do not need the government to come in once again playing games and trying to interfere in provincial jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463887">Today, the government announced $1 billion in assistance for the creation of a fund for long-term care facilities. The fund will come with conditions and accountability measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463888">The Quebec health care system, which is currently grappling with a pandemic, does not need the additional burden of never-ending accountability measures. Quebec does not need the federal government interfering in its jurisdiction, trying to develop a new set of national standards. There are enough standards and rules already in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463889">If someone needs to be accountable, it is the federal government, given its inability to develop financial self-sufficiency when it comes to the vaccine. We know, we see the delays. Apparently, in Quebec, there have been delays in the delivery of vaccines since last week. We will not be able to vaccinate people at the planned rate. When it comes to accountability, it is high time that the government told the truth about the vaccine delivery schedule.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463890">I will say it again. Front-line workers in Quebec need two things: that the federal government increase its health care transfers and that it do so unconditionally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463891">Businesses and workers are suffering from the pandemic, and the government needs to respond appropriately. The Bloc Québécois has often pointed out the ineffectiveness of the Canada emergency rent subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463892">Since last June, both the Quebec government and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have been pointing to the program’s complexity and lack of flexibility. We are therefore pleased with the adjustments to the program proposed today, even if they should have been made long ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463893">In terms of specific assistance for the hardest-hit sectors, including tourism, the hotel and restaurant industry, lodging, art, culture and communications, on November 3 I told the House about the particular difficulties these sectors were facing, and provided the figures to back it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463894">At the time, more than 56,000 workers had lost their jobs in these industries in Quebec alone. We now know that the situation has gotten worse, and the Bloc Québécois has been tirelessly asking for specific meaningful measures for these key economic sectors in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463895">The bill provides$206 million for the regional relief recovery fund, or RRRF, for businesses that are unable to benefit from other federal programs. A total of 25% of that funding should go to tourism operators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463896">We are pleased that the government listened to reason and responded to our many calls in that regard. However, aside from the RRRF-related announcements, we still do not have any details about what some of the other programs that were announced will look like, for example, the business credit availability program for hard-hit sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463897">How is it that, nearly two months after announcing this program, the government still cannot tell us how this program will work? The crisis is far from over and workers and business owners need targeted support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463898">Today, 181,000 small and medium-sized business owners plan to close for good. Over half of the 40,000 workers in the hotel industry are unemployed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463899">Lastly, the aerospace industry and the air transport sector have clearly been left out. Let us remember that these sectors are in crisis. In September, companies in the Quebec aerospace sector had laid off more than 4,000 of the 43,000 workers in the industry, according to the Aéro Montréal cluster. The government must take its responsibilities and develop a Canadian strategy for the aerospace industry. The Bloc Québécois has called for this on several occasions. What is the government waiting for to support workers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463900">In conclusion, the demands of the Bloc Québécois send a strong signal about health. Help and support for workers is a priority. We know that the transfer between the Canada emergency response benefit and the Canada recovery benefit is not working. Day after day, workers face endless delays in applying for CRB support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463901">We experienced it with the Quebec parental insurance plan, and now with self-employed workers. It takes six to eight weeks to get an answer, and we are told that is because of the checks that need to be done. That is unacceptable. These workers are unemployed and have no income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463902">If the checks need to be done, then let us shorten the delays. Once again, we are seeing that the government was not ready to respond to this crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6463928">This strong, heartfelt preamble to the main topic of my speech will help my colleagues better understand the scope of my comments and recognize the amount of time I spent poring over Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, an act to implement certain provisions of the economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 30, 2020 and other measures, which was tabled in the House on December 2 by the Deputy Prime Minister and <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and came before the House this morning. To summarize, this bill outlines and gives details about some of the measures announced by the federal government in the speech that the minister gave when presenting her economic statement aimed at supporting Canadians and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463929">Members will recall how long the government waited before bringing this bill before the House for an in-depth study. In fact, in December, the government did everything it could to fast-track the study of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C-7</Document> on medical assistance in dying, which was being systematically blocked by the socially conservative fringe of the Conservative Party. Everyone has their own battles to fight. I will not say what I think of these petty delaying tactics that put the interests and fundamental rights of hundreds of our fellow citizens in peril. Unfortunately, these people must wait for the government to legalize a situation they have considered carefully and an important decision that they want to make calmly, rather than witness an interminable, agonizing debate dragged out for crass partisan reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463930">To return to my speech, this bill, short as it is, makes major changes to several existing laws. I hope that these changes will contribute significantly to effectively advancing the welfare of all of our constituents. The Bloc Québécois does not take this approach lightly. If the government introduces a bill that makes sense and that is in the interest of Quebeckers, we will support it. However, the government must demonstrate that the bill is neither partisan nor pandering to particular groups, which is what we have been seeing for far too long from the Liberals, even in a minority government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463931">As everyone knows full well, and as the Bloc Québécois reminds the House on a daily basis, the Liberal Party has in its DNA an outrageous obsession with centralization that undermines the spirit of the Constitution that it shoved down Quebec's throat in 1982. Our NDP colleagues have always blindly followed the Liberals' lead in this matter. They act like the Liberals' lackeys, always eager to gather the crumbs that their masters leave behind in exchange for an ideological promiscuity that changes with the political winds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463932">To get back to Bill C-14, the government intends to amend a wide range of existing laws, enhancing them in some cases, but in an unfair way, as the Quebec governments of the past six decades would agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463933">Regarding the best interests of Quebec taxpayers, most of the legislative amendments proposed by the Liberal government to the tax laws will have little or no effect on the current situation in Quebec. In fact, by amending the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, the government is merely confirming the soundness and relevance of Quebec's student financial assistance program, which was established by Daniel Johnson Sr.'s government in the late 1960s. Premier Johnson was only continuing the work of the Lesage government, whose most imposing and important figures were undoubtedly Paul Gérin-Lajoie and René Lévesque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463934">Quebec offers one of the best student loan and bursary programs in the western world. This extraordinarily progressive approach has made our researchers, engineers, thinkers and numerous creators famous the world over, all thanks to the excellence of our university network.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463935">Take, for example, my alma mater. The Université du Québec à Rimouski is internationally recognized for its marine acoustic research and the number of world-renowned researchers it has doing cutting-edge research on ecosystems like the unique, majestic St. Lawrence River. The same goes for Université Laval, the Université de Sherbrooke, the Université de Montréal and McGill University for medical and pharmaceutical research. Quebec ingenuity continues to grow. It is because of the student funding program developed by the Quebec government that we can be proud of the major breakthroughs in the medical research that is so important to us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463936">During this devastating pandemic, I know that my counterparts in other provinces understandably envy Quebec for the prominent place that our researchers, scientists and doctors have on Canada's team.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463937">For decades, the Quebec government has stood up to the federal government and demanded that Ottawa respect Quebec's constitutional prerogatives. The pride of a people gives rise to the significant benefits and advantages that forge a true nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463938">If the government wants to make up for the weaknesses in its legislation concerning financial assistance for students in the rest of Canada, it should consider fair compensation for young Quebeckers who are treated well by Quebec, but not so well by the federal government. It is a simple matter of fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463939">Speaking of fairness, I would be remiss if I failed to mention a fundamentally unfair aspect of the government's action during the pandemic. Despite the billions of dollars in financial support that were announced and given to the Prime Minister's friends and family, we know that those who have clearly been the most unfairly and personally affected by COVID-19 are seniors, that is, our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, if we are lucky.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463940">It is unfortunate that the government has once again failed our seniors, when they are the ones whose financial situation has seriously deteriorated because of the many protective measures put in place for them by the various levels of government. I am very concerned about the fact that, apart from a single lump-sum payment last summer, the Liberal government failed these people who came before us and literally built a society of which we can be proud.

              <ParaText id="6463960">I think all of us understand the importance of underscoring the incredible courage and bravery of front-line health care workers.

I think back to the Spanish flu epidemic and the lessons we can pull out of what was such a tragic pandemic a century ago. In so many cases and in so many countries, the financial and economic repercussions of the Spanish flu, even after the actual pandemic itself had lessened and then ceased, were felt for over a decade afterward, so my comments today are not just about what we need to do now, but also about what we need to do over the course of the next decade.

A closer look at what is in this bill makes it clear that the government does not know how to respond boldly to all the challenges Canadians are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463964">When I look at the substance of this bill, I can see that it is a long way from meeting the expectations of Canadians going through this pandemic and taking a financial and economic hit. Overall, this bill offers a little help, and that is good. A little help is better than nothing, for sure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463965">It is important to say that the government could dare to do more and go much further. As the leader of the NDP, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, and the entire NDP caucus have already made very clear, help is needed now. We need to look at each and every element of the bill and see what is missing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463966">Long-term care is getting help, help that is clearly needed. We are seeing that the epicentre of this pandemic is in Quebec's long-term care homes and in long-term care centres across the country. In these places, we are seeing thousands of deaths resulting from a lack of rules aimed at reinforcing standards of care provided there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463967">Our seniors deserve better in all the services they receive. A billion is not much when we look at what the government has done since this crisis began. From the beginning, we have seen the government offer $750 billion to Canada's major banks. Government members will say that this liquidity support is not just coming from the government, but from a number of sources. The fact remains that in the few days when the pandemic hit hardest in March, the government had to act quickly, and its first act was to provide $750 billion to Canada's major banks. The government's first instinct was to say that it needed to come to the aid of Canada's banks, and it made $750 billion available to that sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463968">If all the expenditures under this bill are spent, seniors will receive just under $1 billion. The ratio is 750 to one: $1 billion for Canada's seniors, who have died by the thousands during this pandemic, but $750 billion for the banking sector, which has already made $30 billion in profits since the pandemic began. What message is the government sending by throwing so much money at Canada's big banks? Is that our priority?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463969">Meanwhile, this bill has only crumbs to offer, and that includes the Canada child benefit. Yes, $100 a month certainly helps, but what is really needed right away is a $2-billion investment to lay the foundation for a national child care system. The unemployment rate continues to rise, and economic difficulties have existed since before the pandemic. Canadian families already had, on average, the highest level of family debt among the most industrialized countries as a result of policies put in place by previous Conservative and Liberal governments. The government could have done better, much better, and been bold enough to do more than simply offer $100 a month to families struggling to keep their homes and put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6463970">The bill also mentions student loans. The government is suspending student loan interest payments. However, students trying to get through this crisis as best they can still have to repay their student loans. Even if interest rates are lower, the amount of the loans is minimal when we think of all the difficulties they are experiencing. Just compare the amount of student loan interest that has been suspended with the $750 billion in liquidity supports given to major Canadian banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463971">With respect to pharmacare, next month we will have the opportunity to vote on Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document>, which will establish the legal framework for pharmacare. I must say that we are seeing strong support for this bill across the country. As a Bloc Québécois member mentioned, dozens of Quebec municipalities have just expressed support for this bill, which will establish a universal pharmacare plan that all Canadians will be able to access. Unions in Quebec and across Canada are also calling for a plan that will leave no one behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463972">With the pandemic, we are talking about tens of millions of people who do not have access to a pharmacare program, either because they lost their job or because they do not have access to a protection plan through their employer. Bill C-14 could have included certain aspects that the NDP will bring forward during the vote in Parliament next month, but right now, that too is being left out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463973">I know that my time is nearly up, but I would like to say that the most disappointing thing about this bill, even though some aspects are rather positive, is the government's lack of ambition at a time when Canadians are going through an unprecedented crisis.</ParaText>

The fact that this cancellation occurred on the same day the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement is telling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6463977"> Shutting down projects like Keystone will not decrease global oil demand, but it will ensure that Canada gets a lower price for its oil and receives less tax revenue and that more Canadians remain out of work. It will ensure that we import more oil from Saudi Arabia and others that have awful environmental and human rights track records.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464260">Mr. Speaker, with regard to air travel complaints sent to the Canadian Transportation Agency, CTA, since February 1, 2020, broken down by month and subject, the answers for part (a) are as follows: February: 4776, March: 3625, April: 2349, May: 1396, June: 1128, July: 1199, August: 897, September: 943, October: 1029, and November: 260, as of November 10. The total is 17,602</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464261">The CTA is currently processing the complaints received for the period referenced. A detailed breakdown of the subject of each complaint is not available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464262">The CTA reports on the subject of complaints received in its annual report. The 2019-20 annual report can be found at: www.otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/publication/annual-report-2019-2020#sec10</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464263">With regard to part (b), of the complaints referenced in part (a), the CTA has processed over approximately 6,000 complaints since February 1, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464264">With regard to part (c), the answers are as follows. With regard to facilitation, of all air travel facilitations closed, 80% are completed within 30 calendar days/20 business days from the communication of the initial position of both parties to the conclusion of facilitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464265">With regard to mediation, of all air travel complaint mediations closed, 100% are completed within 30 calendar days/20 business days or within such longer period as requested by both parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464266">With regard to adjudication, 80% of all air travel complaint adjudications are processed within 120 calendar days/85 business days from the opening of pleadings to the issuance of a decision, net of any pleadings filed beyond the standard answer/reply period, as established in the dispute adjudication rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464267">With regard to part (d), between March 25 and June 30, 2020, the CTA temporarily paused interactions with airlines related to dispute resolution activities, to permit them to focus on immediate and urgent operational demands like repatriating Canadians stranded abroad. However, during this period, CTA staff continued to triage and process complaints, communicate with passengers and address issues raised where possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464268">Notwithstanding the pause and the sudden and sustained shift to remote work, the CTA has maintained productivity levels comparable to last year’s. It has processed over 6,000 complaints since the beginning of the pandemic, including over 3,100 complaints pertaining to flight disruptions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464269">The CTA anticipates that resolution of complaints filed in the period after the APPR came fully into force and before the pandemic disrupted global air travel will be facilitated by the major inquiry it launched in February 2020, which focuses on alleged failures by airlines to respect their communications-related obligations under the APPR. The report of an inquiry officer assigned to gather evidence on those allegations was recently published.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464271">Mr. Speaker,  with regard to part (a) and part (b), Canada’s COVID-19 economic response plan has helped to protect millions of jobs, provide emergency support to families and keep businesses afloat throughout the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464272">Through Bill C-4, an act relating to certain measures in response to COVID-19, the Government of Canada is providing $20 million to support veterans organizations facing hardship due to COVID-19. All funds were to be provided to veterans organizations by December 31, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464273">The Government of Canada is helping organizations that serve veterans access the money they need to replace critical charitable and other revenue lost because of COVID-19. The veterans organizations emergency support fund, VOESF, will give them the resources needed to continue to operate and support the veterans community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464274">The $20-million veterans organizations emergency support fund was announced in November 2020, as part of the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 economic response plan. It was created to support veterans organizations experiencing financial challenges due to COVID-19. The $20-million VOESF will help the recipients cover operational costs like rent, utilities, administration and wages, and will allow them to continue to deliver important services for veterans and their families throughout the global pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464275">Organizations that access these funds will be able to continue their work with veterans and their families during a time when it is needed most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464276">On December 17, 2020, the Minister of Veterans Affairs announced that $2.8 million from the VOESF will go to 38 veterans organizations across Canada. These organizations are in addition to the four announced when the VOESF was launched in November 2020: Royal Canadian Legion, ANAVETS, True Patriot Love and VETS Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464277">Through the VOESF, the government was able to help a total of 42 organizations that serve over 280,000 veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464278">These organizations play a critical role in supporting the well-being of veterans and their families across the country. They carry out a range of services, such as mental health support, social and community support, commemoration efforts, animal therapy, healing through physical activity, healing through nature and counselling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464279">On December 21, 2020, the Royal Canadian Legion announced the Legion branches that will receive support through the VOESF. The Legion, the largest veterans organization in Canada, received $14 million from the Government of Canada to distribute to its branches across the country. This funding will help Legion branches with operational expenses such as rent, insurance, utilities and administrative costs so they can focus on providing important programs, services and support to veterans and their families, and continue their strong community presence. To date, 701 branches of the Legion have been supported through the VOESF and more funds will be disbursed in the coming weeks by the Legion’s Dominion command.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464280">The Legion’s branches are some of the government’s most important partners in supporting veterans, and in making sure that Canadians remember the sacrifices they have made. The Government of Canada has provided them with the funding they need to make it through the pandemic and continues to work together with the Legion on behalf of veterans and their families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464312">Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a) of the question, for the volume of Lettermail, refer to the attached annex. It was not possible to provide a breakdown of the data by province and territory and month by month within the allotted time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464313">With regard to part (b), unless a piece of mail is tracked, Canada Post Corporation, CPC, cannot determine what is not delivered. CPC would know the volume of mail through its machines but not how much “should have” gone through the machine, i.e., inducted but not processed. Similarly, CPC would not know what was processed but not delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464314">Regarding part (c), according to the Canadian Postal Service Charter, the delivery time performance standards are two business days within a community, three business days within province and four business days between provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464315">With regard to part (d), from October 2017 to November 2020, CPC’s on-time delivery performance within the above-mentioned two, three and four business day standards was 95.4% in 2017, 93% in 2018 and 95.3% in 2019. The 2020 delivery performance is not yet available. CPC is unable to provide a breakdown of this data by province and territory and month by month within the allotted time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464316">Regarding part (e) of the question, the volume and percentage of Lettermail delivered beyond or past CPC standards was 4.6% in 2017, 7% in 2018 and 4.7% in 2019. The 2020 performance is not yet available. CPC is unable to provide a breakdown of this data by province and territory and month by month within the allotted time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464317">With regard to parts (f) and (g) of the question, please refer to the answer for part (b).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464318">Regarding part (h), security of the mail is accomplished through a number of security controls. It starts from the security of mailboxes, which were designed with security in mind and are the result of years of evolution and enhancements, from the metal used to construct the boxes to the design of the locks to secure the inducted products through the course of post. These are tested with the assistance of many key stakeholders and suppliers, engineers, as well as internal knowledge of the security environment. The mail is then brought to depots where ongoing threat, risk and vulnerability assessments are conducted. The security assessment is called a facility security index, or FSI, which is a holistic security assessment based on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police threat risk assessment approach. The process assesses not only the physical security and controls at the facility but also compliance to these controls and to security processes. As a result, an extensive report is provided to management with action plans and a follow-up audit that will be conducted for any significant deficiencies, along with proper communication plans on recommended corrective and preventive measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464319">With regard to part (i) of the question, at the beginning of 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 11 FSI reviews were conducted. As these are normally focused on larger urban outlets, where there is a higher risk of COVID exposure in conducting these audits, once the pandemic began attention instead shifted to conducting rural reviews at smaller rural corporate outlets. As such audits take less time to complete than FSIs, with FSIs taking typically a week and rural reviews being completed within a day, more reviews could be conducted, with more than 226 completed so far. In comparison, 39 FSI reviews were completed throughout 2019, 25 in 2018, and 50 in 2017, which was when the process was implemented.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464321">Mr. Speaker, National Defence is taking concrete steps to reduce its carbon footprint in its real property and its fleets. This includes greenhouse gas emissions reduction measures such as energy performance contracts at defence installations across the country, clean-energy purchases and improved energy management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464322">National Defence’s continued investments to upgrade and replace critical National Defence infrastructure and fleets will contribute to the government’s efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464323">With regard to part (a) of the question, when “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, Canada’s defence policy, was released in 2017, National Defence’s goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 2005 levels by 2030. More recently, National Defence, in its 2020-23 defence energy and environment strategy, has adopted a more ambitious target that aligns with the Government of Canada’s greening government strategy. This is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its real property and commercial light-duty fleets, where feasible, by 40% from 2005 levels by 2025, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464324">Separate from its real property and commercial light-duty fleets, National Defence is also committed to bringing emissions from its national safety and security operations fleets to net zero by 2050, in accordance with the Government of Canada’s updated greening government strategy. For the national safety and security fleet, which is comprised of Canadian Armed Forces aircraft, marine vessels and tactical land vehicles, the 2050 target will consider the use of environmentally friendly technologies and low-carbon fuels when available, affordable and operationally feasible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464325">With regard to part (b), National Defence’s 2016-19 defence energy and environment strategy committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 2005 levels by 2030. As of March 31, 2020, National Defence has reduced its emissions from its real property and commercial light-duty vehicles fleets by 31% below 2005 levels and is on track to reach the 40% reduction target by 2025, a full five years ahead of the original schedule.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464326">Greenhouse gas emissions from National Defence’s national safety and security fleet operations, however, are 11% above 2005 levels as of March 31, 2020. These emissions are tied to Canadian Armed Forces activities required to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians. These emissions will vary over time, as the number of times that the CAF is deployed will impact the amount of emissions that are emitted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464327">National Defence is committed to ensuring its activities are conducted in a sustainable manner without compromising the safety and security of the members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464328">As outlined in the 2020-23 defence energy and environment strategy, National Defence is committed to exploring the use of alternative energy options in national safety and security-related fleet operations. Canada is leading the path in this area as one of the few countries making a commitment to manage its military fleet in a sustainable manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464329">Regarding parts (c) and (d) of the question, through Canada’s defence policy, “Strong, Secure, Engaged”¸ National Defence commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while remaining operationally effective. The defence energy and environment strategy commits the department to make every effort to consider environmental and energy implications of its purchase decisions, operations and asset management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464330">Under this strategy, all new military equipment procured is required to consider energy efficiency to reduce overall operating costs and environmental impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464331">As part of the future fighter capability project’s life-cycle cost evaluation process, aircraft that have lower fuel consumption are favoured, which affects the greenhouse gas emissions of the aircraft. It is anticipated that newer propulsion systems technology in future fighter aircraft may result in reducing greenhouse gas emissions of the new aircraft fleet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464332">National Defence is also investigating the use of alternative fuels with a reduced carbon footprint for its fleets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464333">With regard to part (e), as the future fighter aircraft will be replacing an existing capability, the overall impacts on greenhouse gas emissions are anticipated to be similar to those generated by the existing CF-18 fleet. However, operational emissions may be reduced as a result of newer propulsion systems technology in the future fighter aircraft. The level of emissions will also depend upon how often these aircraft are used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464334">National Defence is also working to reduce the emissions for maintenance activities by improving maintenance practices and facilities. The Bagotville and Cold Lake facilities that will house the future fighter aircraft will be designed and constructed to increase energy efficiency wherever possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464335">National Defence is committed to demonstrating leadership in environmental and energy sustainability and will continue to strive to meet its obligation to manage its assets and operations efficiently.</ParaText>

This program will provide up to $30 million to small and medium-sized forest sector operations to offset costs associated with the implementation of COVID-19 health and safety measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464338">With regard to part (b), contribution agreements with participating provinces and territories have advanced, with most expected to be completed in early January. Provinces and territories were allocated base-level funding, supplemented by a top-up increment that is based on a combination of each jurisdiction’s share of total forest sector employment and each jurisdiction’s share of total trees planted. Once agreements are in place, participating jurisdictions will compile and submit claims for reimbursement to the federal government. Once claims are validated and paid, this will enable provinces and territories to reimburse eligible small and medium-sized forest sector businesses, likely starting in early 2021.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464347">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada’s approach to substance use issues has been comprehensive and collaborative, guided by our federal drug strategy—the Canadian drugs and substances strategy (CDSS), introduced in late 2016. The CDSS takes a public health-focused approach and lays out our framework for evidence-based actions to reduce the harms associated with substance use in Canada. It includes four key pillars—prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and enforcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464348">Since 2016, the Government of Canada has taken urgent action to address the overdose crisis through significant federal investments of over $600 million, as well as legislative and regulatory action. This includes working with provinces and territories to improve access to harm reduction services such as supervised consumption sites, increase access to pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to the illegal contaminated supply, i.e., a safer supply, raise awareness of the risks of opioids, and remove barriers to treatment, including stigma. More recently, to build on funding provided in budget 2018 and budget 2019, the government provided an additional $66 million over two years, starting in 2020-21, to support community-based organizations responding to substance use issues, including to help them provide front-line services in a COVID-19 context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464349">The Government of Canada recognizes that in many regions of the country the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating long-standing challenges regarding substance use and the overdose crisis, with some communities now reporting record high numbers of overdose deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency medical service calls. To help address these challenges, the Government of Canada has taken actions to implement important measures to enable the health system to better meet the needs of people with substance use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have issued class exemptions to pharmacists and eased restrictions on the transportation of controlled substances to make it easier for people to access the medications they need during the COVID-19 pandemic while following public health advice, such as physical distancing. We have also made it easier for overdose prevention sites to be established rapidly in temporary community shelters and other locations. In addition, through Health Canada’s substance use and addictions program, the Government of Canada is providing funding to support 11 projects in providing a flexible safer supply of pharmaceutical-grade medications for people with opioid use disorder in British Columbia, Ontario and New Brunswick. These investments will help provide pathways to care and treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464350">The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the ongoing overdose crisis. We have lost too many Canadians to overdose, and all levels of government must redouble our efforts to save lives. For example, the federal government has been working with the Government of British Columbia and Mayor Stewart on options that respond to their local and regional needs, guided by the recommendations of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. We are reviewing the City of Vancouver’s request to address criminal penalties for simple possession of small amounts of controlled substances, and the Government of Canada will continue work to get Canadians who use substances the support they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464351">The Government of Canada will continue to encourage the formation of partnerships between law enforcement and health and social services to help divert people who use drugs away from the criminal justice system and towards appropriate health services and social supports. For example, in May 2017, the Government of Canada passed the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act. This act provides some legal protection for individuals who seek emergency help during an overdose. The Government of Canada in also funding a three-year project in Peterborough, Ontario, to develop a multisector response, with a team dedicated to caring for people at risk of experiencing overdoses, in order to direct people away from the justice system and into care. Further, on August 18, 2020, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada issued guidance to prosecutors directing that alternatives to prosecution should be considered for simple possession offences, except when there are serious mitigating circumstances. This policy is available at https://www.ppsc-sppc.gc.ca/eng/pub/fpsd-sfpg/fps-sfp/tpd/p5/ch13.html.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464352">The overdose crisis is a complex public health issue, but the Government of Canada is committed to working closely with provinces, territories, and key stakeholders to address substance use issues and to ensure that people who use drugs have the support they need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464354">Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has the power to issue directives to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, CRTC, exclusively under subsection 23(3) of the Broadcasting Act. Moreover, directives under subsection 23(3) pertain exclusively to conditions imposed by the CRTC to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the corporation, in consideration of those conditions. The minister has not issued any directive under that section since January 1, 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464355">However, the Governor in Council, GiC, may issue directions to the CRTC under subsections 7(1), 26(1) and 27(1) of the act. The GiC may also request the CRTC to “hold hearings or make reports on any matter within the jurisdiction of the [CRTC]” under subsection 15(1) of the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464356">Since January 1, 2016, the GiC requested one report under subsection 15(1) of the act. The request, dated September 22, 2017, P.C. 2017-1195, was to report to the GiC no later than June 1, 2018 in regard to the following matters: a) the distribution model or models of programming that are likely to exist in the future; b) how and through whom Canadians will access that programming; c) the extent to which these models will ensure a vibrant domestic market that is capable of supporting the continued creation, production and distribution of Canadian programming, in both official languages, including original entertainment and information programming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464357">Since 2016, the GiC has issued one direction to the CRTC under subsection 27(1). The directive, dated April 3, 2020, P.C. 2020-231, was in respect of the implementation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, CUSMA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464358">Other than the aforementioned two matters, the GiC has not issued any directions to the CRTC during the time frame in question, and the Minister of Canadian Heritage has not issued any directives to the CRTC during the same period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464383">Mr. Speaker, what follows is the response from the CRA as of November 25, 2020, the date of the question. With regard to parts (a), (b) and (c), the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act, No. 2, S.C. 2020, c. 6, notes that CEWS is available to qualifying entities, sets out definitions for the terms that apply to the emergency wage subsidy and provides definitions of both eligible employees and qualifying entities. The CRA’s role is to administer legislation as it has been approved by Parliament and assented to by the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464384">While this legislation amends the Income Tax Act, affording discretion to make public the name of any person or partnership that makes an application for CEWS, it does not permit the publication of specific CEWS application information, including province or reason for denial in the manner requested in the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464385">As of November 25, 2020, a public registry of CEWS recipients was in development. Once it is available on Canada.ca at https://www.canada.ca/ en/revenue-agency/services /subsidy/emergency- wage-subsidy.html, it will allow Canadians to identify employers benefitting from the CEWS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464386">As of November 25, 2020, though the CRA has begun a preliminary small-scale CEWS post-payment audit program, it has not yet compiled statistics on reasons for denying claims. Therefore, the CRA cannot answer the question in the manner requested.</ParaText>

However, the audited financial statements of the employment insurance operating account were prepared for the year ended March 31, 2020. These statements were tabled in the House of Commons as part of the Public Accounts of Canada, section 4, consolidated accounts, as at March 31, 2020. Financial information related to measures in response to the Canada emergency response benefit is captured separately in these statements: https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/cpc-pac/2020/pdf/2020-vol1-eng.pdf</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464416">Mr. Speaker, with regard to (a), yes, the government has projections of what Canadian production will look like in five years without Bill C-10.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464417">With regard to (b), yes, the government has projections of what future contributions to Canadian content will look like in five years with the changes in Bill C-10. With regard to (c), a major goal of Bill C-10 is to ensure that all broadcasters, including Internet giants, contribute in an appropriate manner to the Canadian broadcasting system. The bill gives the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission, CRTC, the tools it needs to effectively regulate online broadcasters. To that end, the government prepared estimates of what Canadian content production would look like in both a scenario without Bill C-10, and with the inclusion of online broadcasters in the Canadian regulatory framework after the adoption of the measures in Bill C-10.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464418">In further response to (a), with regard to a business-as-usual projection of future production volumes for Canadian television content, internal PCH projections find that without Bill C-10, falling commercial broadcasting revenues are expected to lead to a decline in the production of Canadian television content of around $1 billion by 2023 when compared with 2018. The projected decline would represent a 34 per cent decrease in production volume between 2018 and 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464419">This figure relates to total volume of Canadian television production, i.e., the total budgets of all television productions that meet the definition for “Canadian content” in a given year. In addition to Canadian television broadcasters, there are many other sources of financing for television production in Canada, including the Canada media fund, foreign financing, Canadian distributors and federal or provincial tax credits. Statistical analysis of historical data for 2012 to 2018 from multiple sources was used to create these projections. Statistical relationships between broadcasting revenues and production were determined and applied to arrive at projections for production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464420">In further response to (b), with regard to the projection of Bill C-10’s impact on future contributions to Canadian audio and audiovisual content, internal PCH estimates find that if the CRTC requires online broadcasters to contribute to Canadian content at a similar rate as traditional broadcasters, online broadcasters’ contributions to Canadian music and stories could amount to as much as $830 million annually by 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464421">This figure relates to total regulatory requirements imposed by the CRTC on broadcasters to contribute to Canadian content and creators, rather than total volume of Canadian production, which relates to producers’ spending on Canadian content, drawing from multiple sources of financing. The contributions of online players would result in total contributions to Canadian content and creators in 2023 being 35 per cent higher than in a scenario where traditional broadcasters alone spend on Canadian content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464422">There are two main sources of uncertainty in this estimate of Canadian content funding. First, since online broadcasters typically do not provide data to the CRTC or publicly disclose their revenues, projections were prepared based on estimates of online revenues and historical trends in those estimates. Second, after holding public hearings, the CRTC may impose regulatory requirements on online and/or traditional broadcasters that vary from its current practices. This could significantly change the number above, which is based on online broadcasters contributing at similar levels as traditional broadcasters do now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464423">It is important to note that $830 million in contributions from online players does not equate to an $830 million increase in production volume, e.g., the effect will not make the $1 billion loss a $170 million loss. In practice the impact on production volume may be more or less than $830 million, depending on the extent of any “spillover effects” and several other factors that cannot be estimated with available data.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464426">Mr. Speaker, the response from the CRA is as follows. With regard to part (a), the CRA cannot respond in the manner requested as it does not have information on the projected number of Canadians who will be eligible for the deduction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464427">With regard to part (b), if an employee worked more than 50% of the time from home for a period of at least four consecutive weeks in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they can claim $2 for each day they  worked from home during that period. They can then also claim any additional days they worked at home in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum amount of $400 would be achieved at 200 days working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464428">With regard to part (c), if an employee worked more than 50% of the time from home for a period of at least four consecutive weeks in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they can claim $2 for each day they worked from home during that period. They can then also claim any additional days they worked at home in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The formula to calculate the deduction is $2 x the total number of days the employee worked from home in 2020 due to COVID-19, to a maximum of $400.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464429">With regard to part (d), the deduction for home office expenses itself is not new. Rather, the CRA has introduced a new temporary flat rate method to simplify claiming the deduction for the 2020 tax year. However, employees can still choose to use the existing detailed method if they have larger claims. The eligibility criteria to use the new method are as follows: they worked from home in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; they worked more than 50% of the time from home for a period of at least four consecutive weeks in 2020; they are only claiming home office expenses and are not claiming any other employment expenses; their employer did not reimburse them for all of their home office expenses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464431">Mr. Speaker, insofar as Indigenous Services Canada, ISC, and its Special Operating Agency, Indian Oil and Gas Canada, are concerned, the response is as follows. With regard to (a), Indigenous Services Canada is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada, PHAC, the Canadian Armed Forces, CAF, and the National Operations Centre for COVID Vaccine Logistics, and provinces and territories to plan and implement vaccine distribution to all indigenous populations. According to the most recent guidance of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, NACI, indigenous peoples have been identified as a first priority population for receiving the vaccine. For decades, indigenous peoples have been neglected and subjected to systemic discrimination in Canada’s health care institutions. This historic and continued discrimination has resulted in an understandable mistrust in Canada’s health care systems. We will continue to work with all partners, including provinces and territories, to ensure cultural safety and respect for first nations, Inuit and Métis when administering the COVID-19 vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464432">Further sequencing recommendations will be made based on considerations of ethics, equity, feasibility and acceptability, such as the clinical characteristics of the vaccines and the exact timing of supply. Allocations of vaccines and their rollout will be informed by NACI advice, with outreach and collaboration with indigenous partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464433">With regard to (b), as of December 23, 2020, Pfizer and Moderna are the only vaccine candidates to have received authorization from Health Canada and the first shipments of these vaccines have been received at various locations and are being administered to priority populations. COVID-19 vaccines will be distributed in Canada in a phased manner, and it is anticipated that supply will begin to meet demand over the course of 2021. The quantity and schedule of availability of vaccines will be the subject of ongoing discussion with provinces and territories who will manage rollout and delivery. The following webpage shows the total vaccine distribution amounts by province and territory, and its updated weekly:  https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment/vaccine-rollout.html#a4</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464435">Provinces and territories receive an allocation of the federally procured COVID-19 vaccine and are responsible for allocating the vaccine to all of those within their jurisdiction, including first nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples.

              <ParaText id="6464453">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada continues to value the contribution of the hunting and outfitting sector to the Canadian tourism economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464454">For the 2016-2018 period, Destination Canada received a one-time, special funding envelope of $30 million to launch a major tourism campaign in the United States. This campaign, entitled “Connecting America”, included a co-operative marketing fund where Destination Canada co-invested into its partners’ integrated U.S. marketing initiatives. Partners were invited to submit proposals for various initiatives that focused on specific activity-based markets, i.e., hunting, fishing, skiing, festivals and events, culinary. Destination Canada did not lead the creative on any of these co-op marketing initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464455">In 2017, one initiative led by Tourism Saskatchewan for a national hunting program was submitted and approved as part of this co-op marketing fund. Destination Canada co-invested funds alongside partners Tourism Saskatchewan, Travel Manitoba and Spectacular Northwest Territories for a national program designed to generate awareness of hunting opportunities in Canada and to enable Canadian partners to gain a foothold in the hunting-focused U.S. travel industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464456">Canada’s regional development agencies, RDAs, work to advance and diversify the regional economies. Through regular programming, RDAs have provided support to the hunting and outfitting industry to expand, modernize, and diversify its product offering, as well as support for marketing. To support the stabilization of the economy as a result of the impacts of COVID-19, RDAs are delivering the regional relief and recovery fund, RRRF, designed to provide liquidity support to small and medium-sized enterprises and stabilize the economy. Tourism operators in the outfitter sector are eligible recipients of the RRRF. Projects are searchable on the Open Government website: https://search.open.canada.ca/en/gc/</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>

              <ParaText id="6464698">There is one key to protecting Canadians, and that is ensuring a smooth and reliable vaccine rollout. The ability of our country to rebuild our economy and get Canadians back to work in every sector and every region depends on a smooth vaccine rollout.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, despite the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s assurances, the Pfizer vaccine delivery is now in jeopardy.

What will happen if thousands of hospitals and health care administrators administer a first dose but procurement problems delay the second?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464700">There are so many questions outstanding, despite the government's claims to have a plan. We wish we could just trust the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but the situation demands Parliament's urgent attention.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6464706">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my fellow New Democrats, I also rise to propose an emergency debate regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine distribution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464707">New Democrats and Conservatives do not often agree, but we agree fundamentally on this issue, and I think it is telling that when we have the official opposition and the New Democrats, who make up a very high percentage of members of this House, agreeing on the importance of this emergency debate, that should be highly persuasive to the Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464708">I think I speak for all parliamentarians when I say that Canadians are extremely concerned about the impact that delayed shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will have on Canada's vaccination schedule. At a time when COVID-19 cases are surging, this interruption will further delay vaccination for Canada's highest-risk populations, because that is who we are starting our vaccination programs with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464709">In addition, highly contagious COVID-19 variants are spreading across Canada, some from Britain and some from South Africa. Indeed, every day the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is delayed will result in avoidable infections and deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464710">Last week, the United States administered an average of 1.16 million vaccine doses per day. As of yesterday, Canada had only administered an overall total of 816,557 vaccine doses. The Public Health Agency of Canada's latest modelling projects that Canada is on track to hit 10,000 new daily cases by February. That is in only a short week. Canada remains on a rapid-growth trajectory, with widespread community transmission and increased outbreaks in long-term care facilities across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464711">Canadian labs have now detected about two dozen cases of highly contagious COVID-19 variants in our country so far. Data from the U.K. suggests that its variant is 50% more transmissible person to person than the common strain. Last week, Major-General Dany Fortin, the military commander overseeing vaccine logistics for the Public Health Agency of Canada, confirmed that Canada will only receive about one-third of expected deliveries to February 7, 2021. That is two weeks from now. We know that Canada is set to receive no new deliveries of doses this week and only 79,000 doses in the first week of February.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464712">The European Union will have a much shorter interruption in deliveries than Canada, despite assurances from the federal government that countries will be impacted equally by supply reductions. While Canada will receive zero doses this week, Pfizer has just confirmed that it will be back to the original schedule of deliveries to the European Union beginning the week of January 25, while we get none.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464713">Finally, there was some alarming news out of the European Union just today. It may be seeking export restrictions on all vaccines produced in Europe because it is concerned that there may not be enough vaccines in Europe. While the government has assured us that the current vaccine interruption by Pfizer is temporary, we actually have evidence and signs that there may be further production disruptions or export disruptions in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464714">There is no more important issue to all parliamentarians and Canadians than their health. We are in the middle of a global pandemic, and vaccines, as the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> just stated, are our way to get control of this problem. I cannot think of a more important issue for an emergency debate than vaccine distribution in Canada and I hope you will grant this very reasonable emergency request. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464719">Mr. Speaker, I think the debate tomorrow on vaccine distribution will be extremely important. I know that many parliamentarians from across the country will want to participate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464720">Before we rose for question period, I had raised issues with Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, but not in terms of content. The content is, in a sense, a small step toward meeting the challenge of the pandemic, but what could have been in the bill and what could have been in the fall economic statement but was not is the real problem, I think, with Bill C-14. It is not the content, but what is not in there and what could have been presented. In the midst of the worst pandemic that Canada has experienced in a century and the worst economic crisis since the Second World War, one would think that in combining those two things, the fall economic statement and the bill that emerged from the fall economic statement would have met the challenges that Canadian families are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464721">Even coming into the pandemic, Canadian families were beset and burdened with the heaviest level of family debt that exists among industrialized countries. The average Canadian family has more family debt than a family in any other industrialized country. That is in part because of decisions made over the last couple of decades that have pushed Canadian families down, including the unravelling of the social safety net and the emphasis on providing perks and tax holidays to the very wealthy and the most profitable corporations, rather than making the public investments that would make such a difference in the lives of Canadians. Then the pandemic hit, and Canadians are experiencing incredible challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464722">In my riding of New Westminster—Burnaby and in every other corner of this country, Canadians are facing daily challenges to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads, yet within Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> we do not see any bold attempt to meet those challenges. It is indicative, I think, that the new American president, Joe Biden, within the span of his first five hours and the executive mandates that he signed, has proven to be more proactive while using government machinery to work in the interests of the people than the current government has in five years. It is five hours versus five years. That is the real disappointment of the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464723">What do we see in Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>? Instead of investments in building a national child care program that we know Canadian families will need as a national network of universal child care as we emerge from this pandemic, hopefully in the next few months, we see scant support given to Canadian families in dealing with the crisis in long-term care. Instead of putting it under strict national standards and making sure that there is adequate funding for long-term care for our seniors, we see a small amount compared to what was given to the banking sector and no real attempt to address the crisis in long-term care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464724">We saw $750 billion in liquidity supports given to the banking sector through a wide variety of federal institutions within days of the pandemic hitting. Government MPs might say that this was liquidity support to help the banking sector; the banking sector so far in this pandemic has received profits of $30 billion. That should absolutely not have been the first objective of the government. There is a contrast between that $750 billion and what people with disabilities, people who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, have actually received in support. I and other members of the NDP caucus, including our leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, have raised this issue numerous times. It took not one or two, but half a dozen fights to get a $600 one-time payment paid to a minority of people with disabilities across the country, yet we have seen $750 billion going with alacrity to the banking sector.</ParaText>

During this pandemic, as I mentioned, the banking sector has had $30 billion in profits. Canada's billionaires have had over $50 billion added to their wealth in the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464726">However, we see a government that steadfastly refuses to put in place what the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> and the NDP caucus have called for. The vast majority of Canadians, when they are asked in public opinion, say the same thing: that we need to put in place a wealth tax. We need to put in place a pandemic profits tax. We had those measures in the Second World War. It meant that we were all in this together, and it also meant that the federal government had the wherewithal to ensure that Canadians had the investments they needed as we emerged out of the Second World War.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464727">We brought this forward in the House along with provisions for a guaranteed livable basic income, a right to housing and universal pharmacare.

              <ParaText id="6464728">Next month, parliamentarians will have a second chance on universal publicly administered pharmacare, because Bill <Document DbId="10866059" Type="4">C-213</Document> will be voted on in less than a month. Across the country we have seen thousands of Canadians write to their members of Parliament to say, “Vote yes on Bill C-213,” above all because in this pandemic a number of Canadians have lost their drug coverage. Ten million Canadians have no access to the medications that their doctors prescribe as necessary. There will be a second chance for that, and a second chance for the government to bring forward the bold ideas that the NDP has been proposing in a budget that should be tabled this spring.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464731">However, the Canadian Armed Forces' report on its experience in Quebec long-term care homes last spring was clear.

              <ParaText id="6464732">The issue is the care homes' ability to comply with and enforce the standards and rules in place. Quite simply, these rules were more difficult to follow because there is a staff shortage. The report found that long-term care homes have a serious shortage of staff with medical training. We need money, not standards.</ParaText>

It has had over $30 billion in profits through the pandemic, yet this industry is leaning on small businesses. In my area, Wilson's bus line is at risk of going under because the government programs that are on offer do not really meet its needs. Bus companies and other companies across Canada are at risk because these banks, which have been raking in profits and have had government help, seem to think they are not Canadian.

              <ParaText id="6464745">Mr. Speaker, this is what is inconceivable to me. There was $750 billion given in liquidity support to the Canadian banking industry without any conditions whatsoever. We saw credit unions stepping up and lowering their interest rates to zero. We saw credit unions stepping up and providing in some cases what was required around suspending the payment of mortgages and not imposing penalties. The banking industry did not have any conditions at all imposed, and the result has been windfall profits of $30 billion and real pressure on businesses like Wilson's and others across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464746">We need to take the best practices of other countries. Other countries said that if they were providing supports, there were going to be conditions. The Canadian government stepped up within days of the pandemic hitting, and its first thought was to help the banking industry. Three-quarters of $1 trillion later, the banking industry is reaping massive profits and so many Canadians and small businesses are struggling. </ParaText>

Whether standing in the chamber or sitting at home, it is always such a privilege to share some thoughts and ideas and try as best as I can to provide a bit of constructive criticism here and there. I like to think part of my job is to ensure there is a higher sense of accountability even from opposition parties. I hope to address a number of points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464757">First, as we all know, life has really changed over the last 12 months for all of us in a very real and tangible way. For example, I never figured I would be addressing the House of Commons via the Internet and what I am saying being recorded as if I were standing on the floor of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464758">It does not matter what one's economic social stratification is. Lives have changed profoundly because of the pandemic. We have seen so many phenomenal efforts come forward from many different sectors of our economy and society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464759"> I want to recognize that over the last number of weeks, our holidays, whether one celebrates Christmas, Hanukkah or one of the many other different types of celebrations that often take place during the Christmas period, were really different. In my province and many other places across this land, we were not able to have gatherings, people and families coming together. However, it did not stop people from communicating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464760">The pandemic means there has to be physical distancing. It does not mean we have to separate that communication link to those very important relationships in our lives, whether with family or friends or in my case and in the case of many of my colleagues with our constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464761">The constituents I represent in Winnipeg North have done a fantastic job in communicating with me, whether through telephone calls, at my constituency office, through emails, letters or Zoom discussions. There are all sorts of ways in which we have been able to communicate. I do not think time would allow me to share all the feedback, ideas, recommendations and concerns that people have raised with me over the last number of months. As much as possible, they would want me to share them on the floor of the House of Commons so all parliamentarians would have a sense of what the residents of Winnipeg North are thinking. There is a higher sense of hope in the minds of my constituents today than there would have been months ago. The delivery of vaccines has been very important to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464762">I listened intently to a number of comments coming from opposition members in particular. If we were to do a fair comparison, we would find Canada has done exceptionally well on that front. I say that without any reservations whatsoever. As a government, we have had numerous ministers on that particular file and they have worked exceptionally hard at ensuring Canada can be very proud of the vaccination agreements we have been able to achieve in order to protect the health and well-being of Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464763">There are some common threads from the constituents I represent. One of them is the desire to see, and many members will know that at times I can be somewhat partisan, governments working together. They want to see a team Canada approach toward ensuring that the health and well-being of Canadians is being dealt with as a top priority.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464765">When I talk about stakeholders, it goes far beyond the Government of Canada. We have to look at our communities. I think of social enterprise groups, non-profits and the many fine works they have done to ensure they contribute in a positive way. In whatever ways they can, our individual constituents have contributed. We think of our first responders, in particular our health care workers, our bus drivers and those driving taxis. These people have made a difference and have ensured we have been able to get through in such a way that we can continue on and feel that sense of optimism today. I appreciate all those individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464766"> The Government of Canada, under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has ensured there is a sense of commitment coming from not only the national government, but provincial and municipal governments and even our school boards. All elected officials, as leaders in our communities, have an important role to play on this issue, and it makes a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464767">When I was back in Ottawa in late November, Manitoba was not doing that well with respect to the coronavirus. On a per capita basis, the number of new cases being reported on a daily basis toward the end of November might have been the worst in the country. It shows that if Ottawa, in support of our provinces, and the provinces make good decisions, we can in fact bring those numbers down. Today we are under 100. In fact, just over this last weekend, we saw many of the restrictions being lifted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464768"> For example, many of my constituents were limited to what they could buy at the local store. Many of those restrictions have been lifted now. Why? Because Manitobans have, as Canadians as a whole have, recognized that we all have a role to play with respect to us getting out of the current situation we are in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464769">That brings me back to some of the comments made by my colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464770">The former speaker, a New Democrat, talked about the Liberals giving to the banks as if they were our first priority. That is not true. The Liberal Party does not put the banks ahead of Canadians. All one has to do is take a look at the types of actions the Government of Canada took back when action was needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464771">I talk a great deal about the CERB program. The Canada emergency response benefit program embodies many of the things that a government can do to make a positive difference for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Let us take a look at the details of that program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464772"> There was virtually nothing, no CERB program, in existence prior to COVID-19. With the support of world-class civil servants, of whom we should be very proud, and the fine work they do, a program was put together that ultimately served just under nine million Canadians. All of us should be very proud of that and should not be shy to talk about it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6464773">That was the priority. At the very beginning, this government was very focused on sending a message to Canadians that we had their backs, that we would be there for them no matter where they lived in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464774">The CERB program is one of those programs that clearly demonstrates that a government cannot only talk about caring for the citizens it represents, but it can demonstrate tangible action. Hundreds of millions to billions of dollars were put through a fantastic program that came from nowhere and ultimately that disposable income was put into the pockets of Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Members should think about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464775">If the government had not done that back then, what would have been the outcome? We would have had more people borrowing money because of their loss of income. We would have had people not being able to pay for basic needs such as their groceries, their rent, their mortgages or buying the things essential to them, whether a single person or families. Hundreds of millions of dollars were put into the pockets of Canadians throughout our country so they would have the disposable income to continue on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464776">If members will recall, back then we were telling people that we had to stay under the curve. The world pandemic was not there two years ago. It is not like we had previous knowledge on it. What we had was a very sharp learning curve for Canadians, a learning curve, for example, that we had to wash our hands for 20 seconds. If people had to cough, they should cough into their sleeves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464777">As we got weeks into the pandemic, health care experts were saying we needed to wear masks. Canadians, through leaders in our communities, understood they had to listen to the health care officials and started to wear masks. When we go for walks today, we see people wearing masks. Compare that to back in March, April or even May of last year. This also included the use of hand sanitizer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464778">These things have really made a huge difference even today. One of the reasons it has had that impact is because of actions by the national government and other levels of government working together to ensure people understood what the pandemic was all about and what we needed to do to minimize the negative impact of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464779">At the end of the day, education, which was widespread on this issue, is one of the reasons why Canada is in a relatively good position today. Some provinces are affected more than other jurisdictions. There are many different factors at play. We cannot compare the Toronto international airport and the important role it plays in our society and the Brandon airport in my home province of Manitoba, even though the Brandon airport is so critically important to our local economy there, in our province and ultimately to our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464780">Different provinces have different areas on which they have to focus their additional attention. There are areas on which we need to improve. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> often talks about building back better and we have the opportunity to build back better. There are a number of good examples of that.</ParaText>

They recognize that the national government has a role to play in health care delivery. Many, including myself, particularly when I was a health care critic in the province of Manitoba many years ago, have advocated for this for many years. I know this might upset some of my Bloc colleagues, and possibly some of my Conservative colleagues, but I believe that the national government does have a role to play. This was demonstrated very clearly through the coronavirus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464782">We have a <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> who has incorporated the idea of the continuation, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did back in September with the throne speech, of the importance of a national pharmacare program. That is something which Liberal members of Parliament under this Prime Minister have been proactive on since day one in 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464783">The NDP will cry that Liberals have been saying this for the last 20 or whatever number of years, but under this Prime Minister and with this group of Liberal MPs, we have seen significant action on that file. I am very proud of the efforts, whether they are those of the Prime Minister or my colleagues, in recognizing an issue that I know is so very important to my constituents. If we check Hansard, we will find that I have introduced many petitions on this issue. In fact, my daughter, who is an MLA in the Manitoba legislature, has talked about the importance of a national pharmacare program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464784">We need to identify the provinces that are prepared to go the extra mile and work with Ottawa. We cannot just bring it in. If we are going to have the type of national pharmacare program that Canadians deserve and want, we have to work with those jurisdictions. It is going to take a coalition of sorts to continue to push this through. I can say that we are committed to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464785">When we think of what actions are in Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, I have a list some of the things that we are talking about. It includes the Canada child benefit increases, long-term care issues, student loans, access to virtual care, mental health tools, substance abuse and the emergency rent program. I will stop on that one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464786">I ask members to think of the emergency rent subsidy program and the tens of thousands going into hundreds of thousands of jobs being saved, the millions of small businesses that have taken advantage of things like the wage subsidy program and the thousands of businesses that are taking advantage of the rent subsidy program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464787">This is a government that understands the important role small businesses play in our society. They are the backbone to our country. We need to be there and we have been there for small businesses. We will continue to be there for small businesses as we have been there for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464788">These are the types of issues that as a government we need to be engaged in. When I listened to the critic of finance, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, he talked about the deficit issue and the trade deficit. Let me remind my Conservative friends that when Conservatives took office after Paul Martin there was actually a trade surplus. It was the Conservatives that turned it into a trade deficit. We have been working on that. Look at the number of trade agreements we have signed off on as a government. No government in the history of Canada has signed off on as many agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464789">In terms of the deficit, I will save that for another speech, but Canadians will do well if Liberals do not listen to the Conservatives about deficits and deficits of financing, because the Conservatives have not demonstrated any competence in that area. When I get a better opportunity to be able to expand on that point, I will. I see my time is running out, and there is so much more that I would like to talk about.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464791">A couple of questions came to mind when I listened to the member from Winnipeg's speech. One thing I am wondering is what his plan going forward is. This is the economic statement, Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, where they are talking about what we can do. We can agree that we need to help Canadians as much as we can through the pandemic. However, I keep asking these questions: What are the Liberals going to do to secure the future for Canadians? How are they going to ensure there are good-paying jobs, going forward, after the programs run out?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464792"> It is time to stop looking to the past and start looking forward. The government needs to roll out a plan for Canadians to make sure there is a future for my children and for the children of members across the aisle. That is why we get into public service. We want to make sure that our children have opportunities that we did not have. I am not sure this is happening for the generation that is coming next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464793">What is the Liberal government's plan to secure our future and to have good-paying jobs? Can that start with the member's support of the Keystone XL pipeline and making sure the government does everything it can to have good-paying jobs in western Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464795">Having said that, the member talked about what we can do now. I want to point out one of the most encouraging things, and we heard it from the minister earlier during question period, which is that six million vaccines will arrive by the end of March for a population of just over 37 million people. It is really encouraging that we are getting these numbers of vaccines and that we have many other companies outside of Pfizer and Moderna to provide them. In fact, Canadians will be able to not only to get the vaccine, but it is also going to be free for Canadians. That is something which we have been pushing for from day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464796">The other thing is, of course, continuing to support small businesses. Maybe in another question, I will pick up on that point.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464806">My question, based on what I heard today, concerns how many Canadians really appreciate, through this process, the public health care system that we have.

Then I look at how many years the Liberals have been promising this. It has been many, many years.

              <ParaText id="6464826">It is an honour to enter the debate on Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>. It is really a do-over bill, as most of the substance of it tries to fix errors the government made last summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464827">When we think of do-overs and references to repeating the same actions over and over again, what comes to mind is the classic movie <I>Groundhog Day</I>, in which Bill Murray lives the same day over and over again trying to learn about the situation he is in. There are some similarities here. His character in the movie is a little arrogant, a bit vain and out of touch with common people, and I think this can be used to describe the government. In the movie, the main character is trying to learn and develop to be a better person. He is trying to learn from average, mainstream people, or the Tim Hortons crowd, we could say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464828"> When I talk to the residents of Saskatoon—University, a lot of them are concerned about COVID. However, they are also concerned about what comes after it when their bills will come due.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464829">I think the most important aspect of the bill for future generations, for my kids and their kids, is the part that mentions the debt cliff and the overall debt of our country. Right now it is being pushed to $1.8 trillion. That is an outstanding sum of money and it is troubling. When I tried to figure out what $1.8 trillion is, my calculator could not do the calculation. I did not know this until last weekend, but a standard calculator only goes up to eight digits, so I had to work it out on paper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464830">This do-over bill talks about increasing the debt ceiling or debt cliff, and I will again reference the classic movie <I>Groundhog Day</I> in a second. What is $1.8 trillion? If someone were to start on the Atlantic coast of Canada and walk to the Pacific coast and then back again, dropping a loonie for every foot they walked, that would not be $1.8 trillion. Someone would have to jump into the Atlantic ocean and swim to Iceland, while dropping a loonie as they swam every foot. That is an outstanding amount of money that future generations are going to have to pay back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464831">We know the Liberals will increase taxes, and the racking up of credit card debt during the pandemic is going to haunt future generations to come. Referring back to <I>Groundhog Day</I>, this makes me remember one scene where a truck is going over a cliff, while Bill Murray is with the groundhog, and it lands. One bystander commented that he may be okay and then the truck explodes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464832">We knew before the pandemic that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to spend money. We talked about the $20-billion deficit in the 2015 campaign, and what did we get? Before COVID hit Canada, we were in rough shape. Maybe some Canadians saw similarities to that movie. Maybe they were thankful we had a Conservative government before the Liberal government and were not in such bad shape because of that. Maybe people thought we would be okay because it was only $20 billion. However, then COVID hit, and kaboom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464833"> We are talking about $1.8 trillion, a reckless amount of money. Future generations are not going to have opportunities because of reckless spending. The bill is trying to fix the problems caused when the Liberals rushed through bills last summers for increased spending. There were obviously errors in how those bills were drafted because we have to do over a lot of those measures, which can be found in Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6464834">I believe Canadians are starting to realize that we are in uncharted territory with this amount of debt and the decisions that are going to come down the road. My colleagues spoke previously about how Canadians do not have to worry, because the government took on the debt so they would not have to, but we know it is a fallacy to think that this is going to help Canadians. I am very fearful of what will happen when interest rates start to creep up. We have been printing money to pay for the spending, and there will come a day, with inflationary pressures, when interest rates will have to be raised. To service the debt right now is going to be a burden for not just the next generation but the next and the following generation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464835">I have another quote that is a little telling from that movie when Bill Murray was complaining about things that people say not to do. “You make choices and live with them”, he says. “I'm not gonna live by their rules anymore.... Don't drive on railroad tracks.” The passenger says, “That's one I happen to agree with.” There are some similarities. Most Canadians are realizing that governments need to be there to help out Canadians when their jobs evaporate because of restrictions due to COVID. The government should be there to act, but with the shotgun approach and the fire hydrant approach of spreading taxpayers' dollars across Canada, there is going to be a bill to be paid. I believe most Canadians realize that we cannot carry on at the clip that we have been without some serious consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464836">Some of the consequences we are seeing are on the cost of living. Canadians who have gone to the grocery store in the last couple of weeks have noticed, and when I went on the weekend, I was surprised that the cost of everything is up. This is going to disproportionately affect Canadians who cannot afford it the most. Vulnerable Canadians are going to see more and more of their dollars going to living expenses, and I am fearful of what that means. In past Liberal campaigns, they promised no new taxes, that taxes would not be increased, that the carbon tax would not be increased. Then we heard different plans they have for increasing taxes, which will have a multiplicative effect on groceries, because we know we have to transport groceries to all parts of Canada. As we increase those costs, what does it mean? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464837">As for the carbon tax, today in Saskatoon it was -35°C, and there is no alternative to natural gas for heating my home. The Liberal government is going to crank up the carbon tax, which will take more money out of consumers' pockets and will have a spiralling effect on our economy. Where does that leave us? Also, once we are through this pandemic and start paying back this massive amount of generational theft that has taken place, taxes are going to be increased, and the net result is going to be less opportunity for the next generation. It is a matter of time before the credit card bill is due and those dollars will have to be paid back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464838">I will end with a prediction of what is to come, quoting again from the movie, if we carry on with this reckless spending and not realize that our actions have consequences. I will give a winter prediction: “It's gonna be cold...it's gonna be gray...and it's gonna last you for the rest of your life.”</ParaText>

The government was left with the choice as to how we should respond to it. We chose to be there for Canadians so they could put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. We chose to be there for businesses so they could keep their doors open and workers on the payroll. When I talked to the Tim Hortons crowd that he referred to, they were worried about keeping their kids in school, whether they would have jobs to go to and whether they could feed their families. The measures we put in place served those ends and served them thoroughly. I would repeat these measures at every opportunity.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6464853">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak today on Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which, among other things, increases the ceiling for the government's borrowing authority from $1.1 trillion to $1.8 trillion. This would enable the government to drive the country an additional $700 billion into debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464854">Even prior to the pandemic, the government's finances were already like a ship lost at sea with no fiscal anchors. For context, between 1867 and 2020, the accumulated federal debt was just over $700 billion. Over the past year, it has exceeded $1.1 trillion, or 50% over our accumulated debt since Confederation. This is a staggering number never seen before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464855">Canadians desperately need the government to have a plan to get Canada’s fiscal house back in order when the COVID crisis subsides. It goes without saying that the government would have been in a far stronger position to weather this storm if it simply had not broken its promise in 2015 to balance the budget by 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464856">With respect to interest rates, I recall vividly a time when interest rates were very high. In fact, my first home mortgage in 1989 had an interest rate of 12.75%. That was a good rate at the time. The former governor of the Bank Canada and the Parliamentary Budget Officer both confirmed in finance committee testimony that interest rates will inevitably go up. Interest rate increases are an existential threat to the federal government’s ability to fund programs, like the COVID programs and others, into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464857">If interest rates go up by even one percentage point, that will cost $11 billion; a 5% interest rate rise would cost $55 billion. I say to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, please heed these warnings. We must be ready. We do not want to be in the same position as Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien were in the mid-90s, when they had to slash health care transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464858">Our economy cannot recover without small businesses being successful, and right now across the country they are hurting, including in my home province of Manitoba. According to the CFIB, 2.4 million jobs are at risk nationally and 181,000 businesses are at risk of closing their doors forever. In Manitoba it estimates that there are an estimated 5,601 businesses at risk, which represents over 102,000 jobs in Manitoba out of a population of 1.3 million people, and 16% of Manitoba businesses are actively considering winding down or declaring bankruptcy. These job losses are from across all sectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464859">While public health restrictions have been necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19, they came with a massive price. This recent data shows the devastating impacts they have had on small businesses and the families they support. If these businesses do not survive, Canada’s economic recovery will be much more difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464860">In saying this, I am not arguing against the need for extraordinary measures, but rather to highlight the desperate need for a recovery plan as soon as possible. Not only have small businesses been devastated, but so have charities. Canadian charities need to be an effective partner in any recovery plan. My bill, the supporting Canadian charities act, would give the charitable sector the boost it needs by making the proceeds of sale of private shares and real estate exempt from the capital gains tax if donated to a qualified charity within 30 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464861">This common sense measure could have been in place six years ago, but the Liberals tossed it aside from the 2015 budget when they formed government. If this measure had been in place, charities would have received hundreds of millions of dollars more and would have been better positioned to respond to the pandemic and be prepared for the recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464862">With regard to vaccines, they are critical to reopening the economy. Acquiring vaccines and getting them to provinces must be the federal government’s top priority. Only 1.46% of Canadians have been vaccinated. In contrast, Israel has vaccinated 22.34% of its citizens; the UAE is at 14.1%; and the U.K. is at 4.19%. Canada ranks at least a distant number 11 in the world for per capita vaccinations. The government has put Canadians at the back of pack with their mismanagement of the rollout.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464863">Canada will receive zero doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week. How can provinces come up with vaccination plans without certainty of delivery? Why did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wait until last week to even pick up the phone and speak to the CEO of Pfizer? We cannot secure jobs, our economy, and our future without vaccines. Where is the plan?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464864">With respect to the aviation industry, it is critical national infrastructure. This debate is not just about regional routes; it is about all routes and all jobs. It is about positioning our economy for a full and robust recovery and securing our future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464865">On Saturday, I spoke with Joseph. Joseph is a 31-year-old pilot. He and his partner live in my riding and have a two-year-old son, who was playing with Lego when I called. After several years of flying, he got his dream job last February flying 737s for WestJet. On May 4, he was grounded because of the pandemic. He fears he may never get back to the work he loves and just cannot make ends meet on available government assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464866"> Joseph and his family and thousands of aviation workers in his situation are counting on us to get this right. The government has said that the purpose of this bill is to “provide assistance to families with young children, support students, and invest in resources to protect the health and safety of Canadians.” I cannot think of a better way to do this than to provide aviation workers, many of whom have young families, just like Joseph, with a plan to protect their livelihoods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464867">Since the beginning of the pandemic, travel and aviation workers have been dramatically impacted in such a negative way. With international travel being shut down and domestic travel slowing to a snail's pace, aviation workers and their livelihoods have been grounded. They were assured for months by the government that help was coming. They were assured that talks with airlines and other industry stakeholders were ongoing to develop a plan. They were told to just wait and be patient. Even after hundreds of aviation workers demonstrated on the Hill in October, pleading for help, all they have heard are crickets from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464868"> With the situation in the aviation industry getting worse by the day, aviation workers and their families cannot wait any longer. Where is the plan? Where are the assurances that these jobs will not be eliminated and that travel adviser commissions will be protected? Where are the assurances for travellers to get full refunds on tickets which were cancelled due to COVID-19? Why is rapid testing not in place at airports? Pilots, flight attendants, baggage personnel, mechanics, independent travel advisers and many others are still waiting for this long-promised plan. Let us not forget it is aviation workers who continue to play crucial roles in the distribution of vaccines and PPE across the country. They are there for us, but the government is simply not there for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464869">While emergency measures in this bill are worthy of consideration, what I do not support is rubber-stamping continued runaway deficits. Combining a $700 billion increase in borrowing authority with these measures into one bill is just simply bad governance. An increase of the debt limit sufficiently to allow for the government to fund the COVID emergency spending through to the end of the next fiscal year would make sense. However, anything further must be contingent on a fiscal anchor and must have parliamentary and committee scrutiny. Such a vast spending authority needs to be considered separate and apart from these important supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464870">To put this in perspective, the $700 billion increase in spending authority being requested over the next three years is equivalent to the total $700 billion debt of Canada accumulated between 1867 and 2020. It is a staggering amount as I have said. The government's borrowing authority should be debated in a separate bill to ensure there is appropriate parliamentary oversight and scrutiny. We should not be providing the government carte blanche to spend as it sees fit, without end and in the absence of such oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464871">On this side of the House, the Conservatives are focused on taking actions to get as many people back to work in every part of Canada and every sector as quickly as possible. We are ready to do whatever it takes to get Canada working again, but we must ensure that taxpayer dollars are treated with respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464872"> As the official opposition, we are committed to ensuring the government's spending supports Canadians when they need it the most while being focused on responsible fiscal management for the years to come. We need to secure the future for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464875">Mr. Speaker, first, I spoke to the former governor in the finance committee. I asked him if and when interest rates would go up. Although he did say that we were in a deep hole, he said that as we came out of the recovery, interest rates would certainly go up.

The sad part about the emergency programs is that they could have been far better, far more effective and, frankly, more timely if the Liberal government had simply let us examine them with proper scrutiny through committee meetings, but that was not the case. These bills were brought forward and basically rammed through Parliament, which is unfortunate. It led to many mistakes, one of which, by the way, Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> would correct by announcing that people do not have to pay their rent before they can claim the rent subsidy.

              <ParaText id="6464878">It is a pleasure to be virtually in the House, from my home in Surrey, British Columbia, to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, an act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement. It contains so many incredible and important initiatives, everything from COVID recovery for Canadians and Canadian businesses to social equality to climate change. The thread that joins all these issues together is that we all make a positive impact in the lives of Canadians from coast to coast to coast now and into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464879">I would like to take this opportunity to talk about some of the many important aspects of the economic update that are of particular interest to my riding of Surrey Centre. I will address some of these areas where individuals and businesses continue to struggle: support for Canadians and businesses as we continue to face the pandemic; creating opportunities and support for youth; and economic development in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464880">Continued support for individuals and businesses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic will be vital for Canadians as we face what will likely be some challenging months ahead. With cases continuing to rise across the country and provinces and territories taking steps to reduce the spread, we continue to see limits on gatherings and restrictions on some businesses in their operations. Support like the Canada recovery benefit and the Canada child benefit, the extension of the Canada emergency wage subsidy and emergency business accounts remain as important as ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464881">I continue to hear from constituents in Surrey Centre who need these benefits. They support our government in whatever it takes to ensure that Canadians have the support they need to get through these challenging times. From Surrey Centre restaurants like Bozzini's to the AP Group sawmill that employ over 80 employees, these businesses were able to survive and continue to employ their workers despite the challenges faced by COVID-19, all due to the federal support measures like the Canada emergency wage subsidy and the Canada emergency rent subsidy, to name a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464882">Creating opportunities for youth is a topic that is deeply important to the Surrey Centre Constituency Youth Council. The youth involved in my council and youth across the country are very concerned about the impact of COVID-19 and their futures. Many feel they have missed out on chances for learning in the classroom, connecting with peers and lost opportunities for employment. Those who have just entered the job market have had a particularly challenging time to find meaningful work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464883">While not part of the bill, I want to take the opportunity to highlight the Canada summer jobs program and the impact it has in our communities. The funding delivered by Canada summer jobs is highly desired by organizations and businesses in Surrey Centre to help them create positions for youth that they would otherwise not have the means to provide. Just as important, youth across Canada also rely on these positions each year, including some members of my office's youth council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464884">The proposed increase of 40,000 jobs for Canada summer jobs across the country for 2021-22 is very welcome news. This means that 120,000 youth will have access to positions created just for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464885"> In addition to the Canada summer jobs, the fall economic statement also proposes 45,300 job placements for young people through the youth employment skills strategy. Together these initiatives will provide more than 160,000 employment opportunities for Canadian youth, positions that will help them gain valuable experience and develop their skills for future employment opportunities as they enter the job market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464886">However, while we wait for the additional Canada summer jobs and opportunities, the bill would bring some debt relief to millions of student loan borrowers who have struggled to pay their bills this year, some as a result of entering the job market during COVID, job loss or reduction in hours due to the pandemic. We will achieve this through eliminating the federal interest on Canada student loans and Canada apprentice loans for 2021-22. This will mean $329 million of relief to Canadian student loan borrowers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464887">Finally, I would like to highlight the regional development agencies across the country. So far these agencies have made $1.5 billion in support available to businesses through the regional relief and recovery fund. Introduced in April, the regional relief fund is providing significant support through Canada's regional development agencies to small businesses that are unable to access other pandemic support programs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464888">The regional relief and recovery fund has supported 14,700 businesses and protected more than 100,000 jobs so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464889">The additional $500 million proposed for the regional development agencies will bring the total support available to more than $2 billion for businesses and entrepreneurs in need of assistance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464891">We know, however, that western Canada is not a homogeneous region. British Columbia and the Prairies have different economic needs. The proposed new regional development agency for British Columbia has caught the attention of small and medium-sized businesses in Surrey. They know the value of the regional development agencies, and specifically the important support provided by the regional relief and recovery fund. This new RDA would tailor support even further to the specific needs of British Columbia businesses, and allow Western Economic Diversification to do the same and focus on the specific needs of the Prairies. This would help programs like the regional relief and recovery fund create even more impact in the regions they serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464892">A new B.C. development agency would help diversify businesses in Surrey that are in the clean tech, health science, forest product, agri-tech and logistics sectors that fuel the economy in B.C. This new RDA would be able to see what is imperative to our local economy and help increase productivity and create more jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464893">These, and many of the other proposed initiatives in the fall economic statement, would be of great help to the millions of Canadians who have been struggling. The quicker we get these programs in place, the quicker they will benefit the Canadians who need them most.</ParaText>

A couple of Liberal colleagues have talked about how important small businesses are to the Canadian economy. However, I remember that in 2017, before the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about the Liberals bringing forward tax increases on small businesses across the country. I believe they were even called tax havens for some people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464895"> I want to ask the member this. Going forward, can we ensure that we will make the economy stronger and that we will secure our future recovery by ensuring small businesses have every ability to succeed and hire more people after the recovery instead of labelling them as tax cheats and raising taxes on them?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464896">Mr. Speaker, the member has not read or seen the facts. Since the Liberal government came into power in 2015, we have lowered the small and medium-sized business tax rate by almost 3%. We probably have the lowest tax rate in North America, but definitely the lowest this country has ever seen. It went from almost 12% down to 9% during this time, all to support and help small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464897">During this pandemic, small businesses were given $40,000 interest free, then an additional $20,000 interest free, of which $20,000 is forgivable after two-plus years once it is paid back. I would say this has saved hundreds of thousands of businesses from some of the pains of the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464898">In addition, we have given them a wage subsidy so they can continue their support. I recall that, at the beginning of the pandemic, employers said they did not want to lay off their employees. Their business was down, but they had good employees they wanted to support themselves. We gave them that opportunity. This government will always be there for small businesses and the—</ParaText>

He praised the merits of some of these programs, which are not under federal jurisdiction, but we know the story well. I would like him to answer a simple question about a program he must be familiar with, because it was his government that decided to set it up. We are still waiting for that to happen. I am talking about the credit program for the hardest-hit sectors, which was announced in the economic update on November 30. There is still nothing to this day. Normally, when an economic update is released, it is because there is a plan. There is currently no program.</ParaText>

Many of the businesses are taking advantage of the wage subsidy, the emergency rent subsidy and small business loan programs, but more needs to be done. Our government is committed to that. In the days and weeks ahead, our government will hopefully be announcing and enacting some of those relief methods so that we can support our tourism and hospitality sectors, and most of all support the workers and the people who are behind them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464910">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which aims to ensure that Canadian families, workers and businesses that continue to be impacted by COVID-19 receive the assistance they need via some of the measures our government detailed in the 2020 fall economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464911">I know all parliamentarians, my colleagues, will continue to ensure we have the backs of Canadian families by providing them with the support they need as we all deal with COVID-19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464912">I wish to take a moment to thank the residents of my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge and the City of Vaughan, who have heeded the requests from public health officials over the past year to do what is right: wear a mask, socially distance and now stay home. Together we will get through the pandemic. On behalf of all citizens, I wish to express our gratitude to the essential and front-line workers who have our backs. I thank them for what they do day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464913">As an economist by profession and a participant in the global financial markets for over 20 years, and who worked through the tech bubble and the global financial crisis, I was frankly not surprised by the magnitude of the impact of COVID-19. It was an exogenous shock that, as referred to in economic terms, froze the Canadian and global economy for a period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464914">With that, since day one, our government has been laser focused and will continue to be there for Canadian workers, entrepreneurs, families and students. Measures such as the Canada emergency response benefit assisted nearly nine million Canadians who one day were gainfully employed, providing for their families and building their futures, and the next day had their workplaces shut down, or even worse, found their jobs gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464915">Our focus remains to help and support these Canadians. The CEBA and the Canada emergency wage subsidy have helped hundreds of thousands of businesses, including hundreds of businesses in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge. The wage subsidy, in one month alone, supported nearly 4.5 million Canadian workers. It has been remarked upon as the key mechanism to maintain attachment between employers and their employees so we can ensure a faster recovery for our economy. We know for a fact that the Canadian labour market is recovering faster from COVID-19 than that of the United States. We do not want permanent scarring to occur in the Canadian labour market, and the CEWS is such an important program to ensure recovery in employment levels as we move into recovery from the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464916">In April 2020, according to Statistics Canada, the initial widespread COVID-19 economic shutdown directly affected 5.5 million Canadian workers, including three million who lost their jobs and 2.5 million who were employed but experienced COVID-related absences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464917">We are seeing a recovery. We know we have much work to do. December 2020's Labour Force Survey recorded 1.1 million Canadian workers who remain impacted by COVID, including 636,000 who lost their jobs due to the impact of COVID. This level of lost jobs is much greater than what was experienced during the financial crisis. Again, we know much work must be done to get our economy back to full employment and all Canadians working again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464918">As stated in the Speech from the Throne, our government has committed to create over one million jobs, restoring employment to pre-COVID levels. As parliamentarians, in the interim we must again ensure that Canadian workers and families continue to have the support they need. The recovery benefits, including the Canada recovery benefit, the sickness benefit and the caregiving benefit, along with enhanced flexibility in the employment insurance system, are ensuring that Canadian families do not have to choose between putting food on their tables or paying rent. We will have their backs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464919">Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> will provide for the implementation of a number of measures from the fall economic statement that will assist Canadian families and students and ensure help for Canadian businesses through the Canada emergency rent subsidy. I know from my friends across the aisle in the official opposition that support for families with children is also a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464920">In 2015, our government promised we would strengthen the middle class and those working hard to join it. The Canada child benefit was at the centre of this promise. This measure has lifted hundreds of thousands of children and their families out of poverty and continues to provide tax-free monthly material assistance to those families in Canada who need it most. In my riding alone, over 15,000 children receive the CCB every month. Nearly $60 million annually in tax-free assistance is being delivered to Vaughan—Woodbridge families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464921">Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> will provide for immediate and temporary relief for families we know are impacted by COVID-19, with up to $1,200 in 2021 for each child under the age of six for low- and middle-income families entitled to the Canada child benefit. This would apply to families with net incomes below $120,000. For those above, the payment would be $600.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6464922">This measure is anticipated to benefit 1.6 million families and, with that, 2.1 million children. I ask my colleagues from all parties to join in ensuring that the assistance to these families and children occurs in a timely manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464923">Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> also includes direct measures to ensure we assist small business owners impacted by COVID-19, with direct and timely payments to cover rent and associated expenses. The measures will ensure that small business owners are able to receive assistance on a timely basis <I>ex ante</I> to help them cover the rent payable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464924">We know that the Canada emergency rent subsidy is assisting hard-hit businesses to pay for rent and related expenses. The CERS provides direct and easy access to rent and mortgage support from September 27, 2020, until June 2021 for qualifying organizations. The program is revamped. We consulted and listened, and provide payments directly to renters rather than having them go through their landlords. For small businesses shut down by a public health order, the rent subsidy will cover up to 90% or up to $75,000 in monthly expenses. Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> would formalize the current administration of the rent subsidy, which includes, again, rent payable. This is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464925">To date, total approved applications are nearly 240,000, with a value of funds distributed to hard-working entrepreneurs across this country of nearly $1 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464926"> We know that young people continue to suffer disproportionately from the economic impacts of COVID-19, particularly on the unemployment front. Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> would assist students by easing the financial burden of student debt during the recovery and, with that, eliminating the interest repayment on the federal portion of Canada's student loans and the Canada's apprenticeship loans for 2021-22. The measure would help 1.4 million Canadians, providing over $300 million in savings to students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464927">We have students' backs, and I am glad to say that we are vastly expanding the Canada summer jobs program, with approximately 120,000 job opportunities this year versus 80,000 in a prior year. This is great news for youth in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge and across Canada as we continue to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>

I read something over the holidays and it continues to strike me as something very important. It is from an International Monetary Fund series written by very well-known economists, authors and thinkers. We want to rebuild. We want to build a more inclusive society and we want to strengthen our social fabric. I will read a quote from an article I read that struck me as being at the core of this.

This was caused by an exogenous event, and our government reacted strongly and continues to provide the help that Canadians from coast to coast to coast need.

They will gradually be assisted as the economy opens up, with the rollout of the vaccine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6464950">Canadians can be forgiven for thinking that this government has been developing a way of protecting Canadians from the virus from scratch. We are constantly being told that this is an unprecedented situation, a one-of-a-kind happening and no one could have planned for this. We are being told how hard this government has worked night and day to keep us safe during this never-before-seen viral contagion sweeping the globe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464951">Our <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has regularly changed recommendations and restrictions, causing confusion and frustration for Canadians everywhere. She said that it could not be helped, and that we learn something new every day. In actual fact, quoting King Solomon from the Book of Ecclesiastes, “there is nothing new under the sun.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464952">I contest that farmers have been tackling the challenge of deadly viruses in their crops and herds for millennia. I myself have dealt with viral outbreaks on the farm. As a matter of fact, one of the very first big challenges we faced in business was a viral infection in flowers. As with COVID-19, there was no cure, and we were forced to cull the crop and start over. This early tragedy informed my understanding and, quite frankly, the understanding of industry and government on how to best tackle and control viral outbreaks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464953">Let me give a concrete example, which has been happening in every province across our great country for years in response to what science has told us about viral outbreaks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464954">Every greenhouse vegetable grower has protocols in place to ensure that viruses are not transported into their facility. They know the danger they face once a virus gets inside. There are devastating economic consequences, so when one enters the facility, one is first asked to simply sign in, just like we are doing now in restaurants. It is an easy but effective way to quickly track a source of infection when it happens. One is then given a gown to wear over one's clothes so that a pathogen is not brought in that way. At every door, there are foot baths to ensure that a pathogen is not brought in on one's shoes. Hand sanitizer stations are everywhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464955">After that, years ago, the federal government mandated floral growers to install complicated tracking and tracing systems for all plant cuttings. These cuttings originate from places around the globe and arrive in Canada on airplanes by the millions daily. The system enables a farmer to pinpoint where in the greenhouse a cutting came from, where it is at any given time during production and even tracks which customer it is eventually sold to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464956">Every step of the way is tracked so that, should a virus outbreak occur, farmers and government can go back and find the source, and work to isolate and eradicate the problem. These are tried, tested and effective methods that farmers have been using for years to ensure the safety of their own crops and those of neighbouring farmers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464957">This is the science that our government is well aware of. In fact, it has regulated farmers for many decades to ensure that they maintain a robust monitoring system that protects the crops of Canadian farmers day after day and year after year. However, with this enormous body of scientific knowledge at our fingertips, and systems and processes that have been functioning very well in the agriculture sector for years, we find ourselves watching our economy being burned to the ground because this government chose to politicize the entire pandemic response procedure rather than follow the science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464958"> Where a farmer will lock his doors to uninvited visitors during an outbreak, our health officials said that it would be racist to restrict entry into the country. Where a farmer keeps gallons of hand sanitizer in stock at all times, our national emergency stockpile cupboards were bare. Where a farmer tracks and traces millions upon millions of plants arriving per year, our health officials have no live health data tracking system in place. Where a farmer tests water, tissue and soil samples on the spot, our <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> declared rapid tests no better than snake oil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464959">It is clear that the real science was ignored and politics took priority when it came to our COVID response, which has cost regular, hard-working Canadians their jobs, their mental health, their businesses, their retirement savings and their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464960">Here we are today to debate the new measures for more COVID support. These measures were only necessary because this government dawdled on rapid tests and vaccines. Because of its failures, Canadians will be among the last on the globe to be able to return to normal. My question is this: Is it reasonable for us to believe that these new measures will do what they say they will? </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6464961">We keep hearing that we are all in this together, which is clearly not the case. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of jobs that were not affected, such as those in the public sector, which represents a whopping 35% of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464962">Elite politicians are the ones who are least impacted financially, yet they continue to fail those who are most impacted. The bulk of the damage is being shouldered by small business entrepreneurs and those with the least amount of wealth in the community. This bill still does not begin to recognize that fact. These new spending authorities request $700 billion in additional borrowing limits, as well as a $100-billion slush fund. As opposed to helping those most impacted, these dollars appear to be earmarked for special pet projects of the ideologically obsessed Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464963">Thousands of women in the travel sales industry have been without an income since March. The highly affected sector support program, which the Liberals announced with great fanfare many months ago, is nowhere to be seen. Single mothers, many primary breadwinners for the family, cannot buy groceries to put on the dinner table. They cannot wait any longer. Where is that support?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464964">I am seeing small business owners in my riding hanging on by a thread. They did not qualify for the first disastrous rent relief program because, let us face it, it was fixed to help a Liberal insider get in on the action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464965"> I am going to hazard a guess that the elite politicians who are crafting these policies have never started a small business. They have never had to borrow from family to make payroll. They have never worked a second job so they could afford the plexiglass dividers they need to be able to open or reopen their restaurant during a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464966">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> are lessons in Canadian political elitism. They constantly assure us that transparency, and science-based and best-practice approaches are the only way they do business. Do they think we do not see that there has been no budget tabled and that they have cancelled audits for themselves, but are pushing hard for auditing the books of small businesses? What sort of due diligence was done in hiring the governor general? Did no one even make a call to check her references?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464967">In this bill, the Liberals are proposing COVID supports that will give them further opportunity to spend without oversight, because they say that during a pandemic they need to have the ability to act fast and save our citizens. However, there is nothing in this bill to suggest they will do anything differently than they have done up to now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464968">Canadians are ready to be the solution. Many households have been saving up throughout this pandemic. They are excited to get back to travelling, working and doing business without government handouts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464969"> Canada has been the best place in the world to live. It has always been a land of opportunity like no other. We will need to leverage our assets to the maximum and make sure our economy is firing on all cylinders if we are going to weather this storm. The government should have had all the tools and expertise it needed right from the beginning. What went wrong when, rather than those of flowers or animals, it was human lives at stake? The Liberal government is so ideologically possessed that science and common sense took and continue to take a back seat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464970"> We have been plagued by this pandemic for a year. Clearly, what we are doing is not working. Our economy has ground to a halt and cases continue to rise. The government has failed to provide the provinces with viable alternatives to lockdowns. It has failed to create an effective national tracking and tracing program. It has failed to procure enough rapid tests to allow businesses to open confidently. It has gone all in on playing the waiting game until everyone is vaccinated, and it could not even get that right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6464971">Now the government is using this opportunity to force its ideology down Canada's throat, requesting that Parliament allow it to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars to experiment with a reimagined economy. Canadians are tired of this credit card economy. They want a paycheque and the dignity that comes with providing for their own family. Canadians need leadership that is focused on Canadian resources, productivity and ingenuity, not a brave new world.</ParaText>

That is below the 66% ratio that led to a near default in 1996, but we are getting awfully close. The Bank of Canada projects that business investment will grow at .08% over the next two years, failing to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2023. Consumption will grow at 4.7%, five times faster than investment. Consumption and government spending will represent about 80% of the economic growth for the next two years, while investment and exports will be less than zero.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465005">The government has announced $100 billion infrastructure spend over the next 10 years. The problem continues to be, however, that no matter how much it announces or how amazing the results will be, Canadians continue to be left in the dark as to what is the plan for how their money is going to be spent. Spending that does not improve productivity, lower costs or create opportunities for additional revenue will just continue to put us on a debt spiral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465006">In the face of this insurmountable debt, Canada's <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> spoke about unlocking preloaded stimulus, fuelled by Canada's savings to tackle this debt. The fact is that in a country of 37-odd million, with an average household savings of $852 per year, this is not exactly what I would call a cure-all for the economic situation in which we have found ourselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465007">On the other hand, we are a vast country, one of abundant resources, world-class institutions, providing cutting-edge research, and technology industries producing innovative solutions to everyday issues. If we are going to service this more than $1 trillion debt, we are going to have to dig far deeper than our own pockets and work with all that we have and all that this country can offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465008">Canada fell out of the top 10 ranking of the world's most competitive economies. We have fallen near the bottom of our peer group on innovation, ranking 17th. We have the highest unemployment rate in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465009">With a country of our size and the sparsity of population we have, there is no way that we can rely on our internal economy to lead us to recovery. Canada will need massive growth and exports to fuel any kind of recovery. Spending in infrastructure should be predominantly focused on those things that improve productivity, competitiveness and access to markets. Private sector innovation is what is going to lead us into the future and provide us with the technology we need to shift to both global sustainability and reinstate us as one of the world's economic leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465010">In 2019, mineral fuels, including oil, accounted for 22% of our country's total exports, the number one exported product. We have the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world and the third-largest exported, primarily to the U.S., which now is of huge concern because of the Keystone decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465011">Now is not the time to restrict export growth, but rather see an expansion of our capabilities in all sectors, including oil and gas. There is a market opportunity for resources, which are extracted both ethically and to an ever-improving environmental standard. The world wants more of what Canada produces. Canada is home to incredibly strong industries in minerals, agriculture, forestry, pulp, paper and all forms of energy production, such as tech, aerospace, fisheries, to name a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465012"> The world faces a confluence of changes and technology advantages that are fundamentally altering the relationship between individuals, economies and society. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465013">Innovations in a diverse set of fields, including robotics, genetics, AI, sustainable energy and traditional sectors, are all individually imperative to economic recovery. These innovations, just as we have come to rely on in a pandemic, will be evermore important to lead us out of it. Prioritizing innovation today is a key to unlocking post-pandemic growth; the quality and the quantity of our research and development, ensuring that IP that is developed in Canada stays in Canada; policies that encourage new employees and employees to come to Canada to help support these industries; and, most important, tax policy that encourages entrepreneurial growth and expansion rather than penalizes it. If ever Canada were in a position that we needed to grow and grow our exports and support our entrepreneurs and businesses, this is now the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465014">I look forward to the government putting forward a budget that will actually demonstrate how we are going to do this and how we can ensure future generations have the same opportunities that many of us have had today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465027">Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my good friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252972" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation>. It is an honour for me to join members in the House of Commons virtually today and speak on our government's commitments to support vulnerable Canadians. I want to specifically focus on long-term care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465028">Let me begin by acknowledging that I am speaking from the traditional lands of many indigenous peoples, most recently the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465029">The second wave of the pandemic has caused a surge in COVID-19 cases. Today, in Ontario there were a staggering 1,958 positive cases and 49 additional deaths, 29 of them in long-term care homes. While personal sacrifices have been made to help flatten the curve, including cancelling celebrations, postponing special milestones and staying physically distanced from our loved ones, we must continue to do our part to help each other every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465030">Every action that reduces the burden on our front-line and essential workers keeps Canadians safe and brings us closer to the end of this difficult chapter. With the arrival of two safe and effective COVID vaccines, we have seen the first signs of light. To date, our government has distributed over 1.1 million vaccines to provinces and territories, with millions more on the way. Securing the world's most diverse vaccine portfolio has ensured that all Canadians who want a vaccine will get one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465031">I want to take a moment to reflect on the Canadians who are presently fighting this virus. We all know people who have been infected and have done everything in their power to bravely battle COVID-19. I think about my dear friend who is in the hospital right now and his family. Last night, we held a prayer service for his recovery and the recovery of all those struggling with this virus. He is a fighter. I know he will pull through these dark days and come home soon. I want to thank those who are caring for him at the Lakeridge Health in Ajax and all the front-line and essential workers who are, at this moment, away from their families and helping us fight the pandemic, including those at the Tony Stacey Centre for Veterans Care, the Ehatare Retirement and Nursing Home, Altamont Care Community and Extendicare Rougevalley in Scarborough—Rouge Park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465032">We do not know when this crisis will be behind us, but we know that we will get through it the way Canadians always have: together. While Canada has done relatively well in handling the pandemic, our systemic failure within our long-term care homes is a national shame. I recognize and acknowledge that the long-term care homes are a provincial responsibility. In some respects, it is easy for us to say this and point fingers. Truth be told: no one cares about jurisdiction. Canadians want action and rightfully so. Decades of neglect have eroded the fragile foundations of these facilities. An absence of accountability and apathy toward oversight has shifted the culture from one of long-term care to one of long-term crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465033">The long-term care system was not broken by COVID-19; it was built this way. If we do not act, we will repeatedly fail Canadian after Canadian after Canadian. Since last March, 3,376 people have died in long-term care homes, including 11 staff in Ontario alone. This includes 80 residents and one staff member in my riding of Scarborough—Rouge Park. I suspect there may be more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465034">During the peak of the first wave, provincial governments requested logistical support from the Canadian Armed Forces. I would like to read some of the haunting findings of the Canadian Armed Forces personnel during their time in our long-term care facilities in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465035">Upon arrival at the Altamont care home in Scarborough Rouge Park, Canadian Armed Forces personnel identified that many of the residents had been “bed bound for several weeks”, with no evidence of residents being moved to a wheelchair for parts of the day, repositioned in their beds or washed properly. Most residents were reported as not having three meals a day, with the facility itself described as having insufficient wound care supplies and often no PSWs on site for the evening shift.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465036">Similarly deplorable living conditions were identified by the Canadian Armed Forces members stationed at Orchard Villa, Eatonville Care Centre, Hawthorne Place Care Centre and Holland Christian Homes Grace manor in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465037">We know that the crisis in homes is not limited to these five facilities. I would like to thank my fellow colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252854" Type="2">Pickering—Uxbridge</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252732" Type="2">Etobicoke Centre</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252737" Type="2">Brampton North</Affiliation>, as well as the member for <Affiliation DbId="252640" Type="2">Humber River—Black Creek</Affiliation>, for their continued advocacy to push the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario to do more to protect the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465038">COVID may be the primary cause of death, but irregularities in staffing levels, precarious rates of pay for primary care workers, insufficient hours of direct care for residents, the disaggregation of data, poor incident management planning, inconsistent financing and lack of modernization to reflect the changing needs of residents are equally egregious factors that have contributed to this senseless loss of life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465039">Therefore, how do we move forward? Erecting iron rings or permanently placing military personnel in these facilities is not a long-term solution to the crisis of care. For the short term, we must do everything in our power to protect Canada's most vulnerable. I call upon Premier Ford to call in the military. We are in this together and we have seen the effectiveness of our men and women in uniform at these facilities. We cannot allow the system to continue failing our seniors. We cannot stand by without exhausting all options. What we can do is send in the army, and we need the premier to make this request. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465040">Our government will continue supporting provinces and territories in whatever capacity necessary to ensure that we overcome the crisis of care together. We should be ashamed of ourselves for normalizing substandard living conditions for any Canadian, but especially those incapable of caring for themselves. When we were too young to feed ourselves, it was these women and men who fed us. When we were not able to bathe ourselves, it was these women and men who bathed us. When we were too sick to care for ourselves, it was these men and women who watched over us. These are the men and women who fought for us and our freedom. We cannot repay them for their lifetime of service, but right now, when they need us most, we are failing them. We must do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465041">In November, I joined advocates and Canadians for national long-term care standards on Parliament Hill for a special tribute to the thousands who have died due to COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care. Families and friends laid thousands of pairs of shoes on the front lawn to honour the memories of their loved ones. As the shoes stood silently, the air was filled with an unmistakable sense of heartbreak, anger, grief and tremendous loss. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465042">As legislators, it is our job to represent the voices and will of the public. The public has spoken loud and clear. People do not want jurisdictional squabbles to jeopardize the health and safety of their loved ones; they do not want to worry that those who neglect Canadians in need will not be held accountable; and, most importantly, they do not want these shameful standards of care to continue. The public demands action and our government will continue to act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465043">Our government has invested a $3-billion wage top-up for essential front-line workers to help ensure that workers on the front lines are effectively compensated for their critical role in the fight against COVID-19. Our government's safe restart agreement included a $740-million investment in the provinces and territories for long-term care. By restructuring the investing in Canada infrastructure plan, our government allowed provinces to transfer 10% of their infrastructure investments to COVID-19 support projects, including long-term care projects. Our government's $38.5-million commitment to support the training of up to 4,000 personal support workers will help address some labour shortages in long-term care. In addition, our government's new $1-billion safe long-term care fund will help ensure that Canadians living in care homes will begin to live their lives in dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465044">If we do not significantly reform long-term care in Canada by addressing the systemic failures of these facilities and establishing national standards, we will not cure the crisis within the sector. First and foremost, provinces and territories need to work together with the federal government to establish national standards of care. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465057">We have expended a great deal of funds to the provinces themselves. It is essential that we do everything we can to support those in long-term care homes. However, I do not necessarily think that imposing the Emergencies Act will solve that. I think there are deeper-rooted issues that may not be resolved overnight. What we need to do is mitigate the losses we have had.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465059">Madam Speaker, Canada has been fighting COVID-19 for almost a year now and here in Toronto, where I am talking to you from, we are in an aggressive second wave. We are in the midst of shutdowns and kids are home from school for another few weeks at least. As we negotiate this, I want to take a moment to give a shout-out to essential workers and front-line workers in the community who have been working relentlessly and tirelessly to support our community. I give a shout-out to, for example, Michael Garron Hospital, which has been doing assessment centres to support the community, and also vaccine rollout, which relates to talking about long-term care homes. The hospital managed to vaccinate the residents and people working in the 22 long-term care homes in its district well in advance of the scheduled times. It completed that a few weeks ago, in fact. It did a really great job. People at South Riverdale Community Health Centre, as well, have been running assessment centres and working tirelessly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465068">Madam Speaker, I apologize for the complications with interpretation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465069">I was giving shout-outs because it has been a hard time for everyone. I also wanted to recognize the stress that a lot of people are under and highlight the Wellness Together website, wellnesstogether.ca, as well as Kids Help Phone. Those are amazing resources that people should know about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465070">As we are talking about the fall economic statement and supports, I want to talk a bit about some of the existing supports, including the Applegrove Community Complex in my community. It has received federal funding. The staff are making calls and checking in on seniors. It is a really important time to be checking in on one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465071">Today I would also like to focus on our local businesses. I talked with hundreds of local business owners in the community. They have been resilient and tough, but they need our support. One example of resilience is a local business, Looking Glass Adventures, which is an escape room. Imagine an escape room in the time of COVID. It has pivoted to offering its service online. Someone is inside, and they use a camera to show people around the place. It is amazing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465072">The most amazing thing is that not only has it been innovative, but it has been supported through federal programs, such as the wage subsidy and other programs. I want to highlight the importance of government programs working with communities and local businesses and providing the support that they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465073"> Our government cares. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our government has invested $322 billion in direct measures to fight the virus and to help people. That includes $85 billion in tax and custom duty payment deferrals. Throughout this pandemic, I have seen government programs to support businesses that have been responsive. The programs have been evolving to respond to what local businesses have been highlighting as issues as we go along. That has been very important as we have been addressing it all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465074">Federal programs have stabilized the economy, provided direct income support and bridged businesses through this difficult time. This will continue deep into 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465075">One program that I do not think has had enough attention supports live music. I love live music and our live music venues. There was $500 million in emergency support to the creative industries and sports. This included a live music support fund, which funded venues that would not normally receive funding, including here in my home community, the Dora: a bar that has great live music. In Toronto, there are Lee's Palace, the Horseshoe Tavern and all sorts of amazing venues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465076">There is more to do. That is where the fall economic statement comes in. Tourism, hospitality and entertainment are vital parts of our economy. Our main streets, with the restaurants and cafes, are hubs. They are the employers in our community. Our neighbours own these businesses. Many of them have faced regular and deep shutdowns, especially where I live in Toronto. These pandemic restrictions have taken a toll.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465077">In addition to the existing wage subsidy, the Canada emergency business account, and the rent support program, the fall economic statement brings more to continue the response. One program that I would like to mention is the highly affected sectors credit availability program, or HASCAP fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465078">This is really for the hardest-hit businesses: tourism, hospitality, arts and entertainment. It will provide 100% government-guaranteed financing for the hardest-hit businesses. There will be low-interest loans of up to $1 million with terms of up to 10 years. The interest rates will be below market rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465079">This is in addition to the regional relief and recovery fund, which supported more than 2,800 tourism-related businesses, and the Canada emergency rent subsidy, which combined with lockdown support can provide up to 90% of rent and commercial mortgage interest when public health orders cause a lockdown, such as is happening in Toronto.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465080">The fall economic statement will also do more to support our local businesses. For the Canada emergency business account, the deadline to apply is going to be extended to March 31. That is important. When I talk with businesses that are navigating their different needs, they say having that extra flexibility to be able to apply is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465081">Another important piece, which I hear about all the time, is the wage subsidy. This will be extended to June 2021, and the fall economic statement will increase the amount paid for the period to 75% until March. That was the kind of predictability that local businesses were asking for when I was talking with them, and it helps support jobs. I can see the jobs that are supported right here in my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465082">In addition to the wage subsidy and the other programs, I want to highlight the Canada summer jobs program. It provides employment to young people, who are among those who have been the hardest hit economically during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465083">The Canada summer jobs program will be increased by up to 40,000 jobs, which will help local organizations, local businesses and young people who are looking for work. Also, there is going to be an increase in funding for skills and training and employment support across the board, and there is specific funding for the youth employment strategies. This will pay off not only for local businesses and different organizations but also for young people across our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465084">When talking about young people, I also like to mention the Canada child benefit. One piece I have heard from people in my community who are the hardest hit is that the Canada child benefit has a tremendous impact. In fact, it has had a huge impact on child poverty rates across the board. This year, there will be a temporary increase of up to $1,200 for families with children under the age of six, which is going to be an important piece.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465085">The final piece is interesting for me, as I am a woman who has spent a lot of time balancing work and children. I had a hard time finding child care and managing to work from home while my kids were running around. I would feed them cookies while on telephone calls just to keep things going. I was really happy to see, in the fall economic statement, that a framework is being put in place for a national child care system, something that truly will make such a huge difference to so many families right across our country. It is an important place to start with in our fall economic statement as we come out of this pandemic. I have talked with a lot of people who have felt the strain, and I have seen how hard it is. In Toronto, child care is still expensive and is often really unattainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465086">While the federal early learning and child care funding to date has helped to provide 40,000 affordable child care spots across our country, I can see the need for more. The fact that we are supporting an increased program that will help to build on that and create a universal child care system across our country is something I am really excited to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465087">I am running out of time, but I am happy to answer questions because I am really excited about how we will build back from this pandemic and how we will continue to support our businesses and individuals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465093">My question is really about fairness.

They are getting an extra benefit, while small businesses are struggling every day just to make ends meet.</ParaText>

Many in the member's party did not support this, but it does increase fairness.</ParaText>

At the outset, I would like to inform the Speaker that I will be sharing my time with a member to be disclosed the next time I get up to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465099">The legislation has a number of great steps that could help Canadians during these difficult times. Enhancing the child care benefit was a recommendation, an idea, by the leader of the official opposition. It will no doubt help parents and women as they struggle through the additional child care challenges created by the pandemic. Granting a one-year break in interest on student loans will help students as they struggle to obtain part-time or full-time jobs during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465100">I support these measures and I want to make that clear on the record. However, as important as the relief is, these are band-aids. They are painkillers meant to ease the pain, as they do not address the underlying illness. Canadians need a plan that allows them to return to work and really addresses the underlying illness and cures it once and for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465101">The pandemic has brought millions of proud Canadians to their knees. We have seen millions of Canadians lose their employment and millions of business owners lose their livelihoods and even their life savings. The pandemic has cost thousands of lives. It has created substance abuse problems. It has exacerbated our opioid crisis and has created an epidemic of suicides across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465102">We need a plan that will expertly eliminate COVID-19 from our shores forever and make us prosperous once again, which we have always enjoyed in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465103">What are the steps to this plan? It starts with testing. Our plan must include rapid testing. Rapid testing needs to be ubiquitous across this land, not just in every province and every town, but on every street in Canada. Canadians need to have easily accessible COVID testing in their local pharmacies, their workplaces and our schools so we can identify immediately or shortly thereafter who has COVID, treat the sick and isolate them so that others do not fall ill to COVID-19. This would allow healthy Canadians to return to school and work and get on with the work of making Canada a prosperous nation once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465104">Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> will not make rapid testing ubiquitous in our nation. It will be leaving Canadians behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465105">This pandemic will ultimately end when every Canadian who wants a vaccination has a vaccination. As our entire economic outlook depends on when Canadians are vaccinated, the acquisition of vaccines should be an absolute obsession for the government. It should be the first thing we think about when we wake up in the morning and the last thing when we go to bed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465106">However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is letting us down. He did not even bother to call Pfizer until he was shamed into making calls by the Ontario premier and the media. The Liberals will no doubt regale us again and again with their stories of unlimited vaccines, the most vaccines per capita. However, in life, and even more so in a pandemic, timing is everything. We need 37 million-plus Canadians vaccinated now, not 100 million Canadians vaccinated 20 years from now. That will do us no good. We are currently below many countries in terms of vaccination rates. Israel, the United Kingdom, the United States, Bahrain and the United Emirates have at least double our vaccination rate, and now we are going an entire week without any vaccinations when many countries are continuing to receive their vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465107">Canada's vaccine program needs to be expedited.

Thousands more are counting on even serious upset. Thousands of Canadians have just been laid off. They were counting on employment opportunities at a time when our country is already shaken to its foundations from an economic crisis related to COVID-19. They are now being laid off when Canada is already suffering from some of the highest rates of unemployment in the G20 as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The province of Alberta is already suffering from other misguided policies of the government, whether Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> or others, that have already had tens of thousands of people out of work, that have empty office towers in Calgary.

              <ParaText id="6465120">We are in the middle of the greatest economic crisis we have faced in modern times as a nation. It is essential that we get every Canadian back to work in every sector, in every corner of the country and as quickly as we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465121"> The government is afraid to have a budget because it does not want to show Canadians the incredible economic challenges the country has. We need to pull together, the people in the west, in the east, in Quebec and Ontario. We must value the ability for us to work together to recover from this COVID-19 crisis and, therefore, we need our energy sector to be successful. That is why Conservatives have been pushing so hard for months for the government to develop a clear plan for our economic rebuilding and our vaccine rollout.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465122">The government spent months on a CanSino Chinese vaccine debacle when it should have been preparing the regulatory process and negotiating with companies like Pfizer, Moderna and others to manufacture in Canada or to secure a stable supply. This week, with thousands of cases daily across the country, Canada is one of the few countries in the world to receive zero vaccines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465123"> However, if there is one area that this decision leads to a catastrophic failure of confidence, it is the disdainful way that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has attacked our energy industry for the past five years, beginning with his first trip abroad when the Prime Minister of Canada mocked an entire sector of our economy, a sector that has provided so much to Canadians, to our way of life, to our prosperity. He said that the last prime minister talked about resources. He said that Canada was more than resources, that we were resourceful now, with one word, swiping away tens of thousands of jobs, thousands of examples of innovation, productivity and technology that is world-leading, a prime minister who is not proud of our industries because he does not understand them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465124">In fact, this is the second time the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has failed to make the case for Keystone XL under two separate U.S. administrations. Every time the Liberal government has a chance to promote Canadian energy, it sides with activists over science. It sides with foreign protesters over first nations that are invested in the project. It sides with trendy slogans over smart policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465125">Hard-working Canadians in all corners of the country deserve better than a prime minister who does not understand them let alone one who looks down on them, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has on many occasions. We need the federal government, particularly now in a crisis, to stand up for workers in every corner of the country. Jobs for Canadians are the only way we will secure our future and rebuild our economy, which has been ravaged by this pandemic. The Liberal government should have done more for our world-class energy sector than its record of indifference and incompetence.</ParaText>

We deserve a prime minister who understands hard work and what it means to get his or her hands dirty to provide for his or her family. We deserve a prime minister who will champion Canadian energy as the most ethical, environmentally conscious and most socially responsible in the world. The world is looking for investments with strong environmental and social governance, or ESG. Canadian resources offer ESGI, environmental and social governance with indigenous partnerships and participation. Canadians should be immensely proud of that. The Liberals' failure on Keystone will be felt in our country for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465130">Let us add to the list: job-killing policies like Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, the carbon tax, tanker bans, illegal rail blockades and endless regulations. That has led to $160 billion of capital leaving Canada. Those investments mean jobs.

Indigenous communities on both sides of the border were planning their futures based on projects like this.

I realize this is on Keystone specifically, but the member was talking about unemployment rates at the beginning of his remarks and how Canada's unemployment rate is so high. It is true that we have the second-highest unemployment rate in the G7. One thing the Conservatives do not talk about, and I have heard this said a number of times today, is where we are with respect to deaths per million people, namely that we are rated second best in the G7 countries. When we compare ourselves with a place like the U.S., just to the south of us, its unemployment rate is 2 percentage points lower than ours, but its death rate per million people is 2.5 times ours.

I am also honoured to be here speaking among a handful of my colleagues tonight while representing the deep desire of so many of our colleagues across Canada who wanted to speak this evening to this gut-wrenching decision. We need to address here the rationale, the repercussions and the remedial options as a country going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465163">Keystone XL, until last week, was a pipeline that has been in the works for over 12 years, a pipeline that would have connected one of Canada's great and valuable world-class resources directly with the market that needs this specific resource more than anything else, a pipeline that, like all infrastructure, got better in design with time. The version being built now is designed to be carbon neutral in its operation, a boon to the renewable energy industry. It is a pipeline that would have provided increased energy security to North America in the clouds of ever more uncertainty in the political landscape, a pipeline providing valuable jobs and benefits to thousands of workers, indigenous organizations and land owners in two countries, a pipeline built upon the goodwill developed between two of the world's advanced democracies in delivering sound outcomes for the health of both our nations' citizens for decades now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465164">Now Keystone XL is a symbol of the victory of loud, self-interested, regressive voices overruling sound regulation and environmental science, a symbol of empty political rhetoric and repetitive misinformation triumphing over an actually better environmental outcome, a symbol that beneficial work undertaken and billions of dollars in good faith can be overruled by fiat, without consequence. Most of all, for Canadians it is a symbol of what happens when our elected federal politicians sit on their hands and fail to advocate for Canada's proactive solutions for environmental advancement, indigenous participation in our economies and building on our competitive strengths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465165">Let us assess the very real negative outcomes that are being felt today. Let us remember the workers and their families, the ones who trained and built careers focused on adding value and getting world-class resources to market. Let us remember that, in the end, the business we are in, as politicians, is about looking after people. In that respect, the current government needs to do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465166">With this stroke of a pen, thousands of well-trained, middle-class Canadians will have worse outcomes in their lives.

The failure here is the lack of concerted advocacy by the government on issues that matter to these workers and the technologically and environmentally advanced solutions they provide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465167">Where was the government while the option of cancelling this important project was advanced and discussed?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465168"> Nine months ago, the prospect of this cancellation became very real. Two months ago, the possibility was crystal clear. We have seen the current government act on files when it felt it should be active. We have seen a powerful reaction to objectionable tariffs against our Canadian aluminum and steel industries. We have seen the leadership of the current government in taking actions above and beyond accepted democratic norms to save jobs in one engineering company. Last week, the workers and indigenous stakeholders in this project got the benefit of a line item in a phone call between our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a new American president. The dichotomy is quite clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465169">In my previous work, decisions such as this presented an opportunity to assess winners and losers, usually presenting a path forward. Much has been lost here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465170">I have spoken about the workers. I have spoken about indigenous reconciliation. Keystone XL had equity representation from indigenous participants, who would have made great steps forward on a path to economic reconciliation. I have spoken about the energy security and the environmental advances that have been thwarted. I have spoken about the billions of dollars and years of planning and building that will leave a piece of world-class infrastructure half finished.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465171">I have not spoken enough about the Canada-U.S. bilateral relationship, but that is a huge casualty in this decision. Last year, we watched this government accept that it had badly negotiated a renewed North American free trade agreement. Real negotiators saw through our team's virtue signalling and inability to solve difficult issues. I listened as our lead minister on the file stated that her greatest success was removing the energy-sharing agreement between the previous text of NAFTA. I knew then that this government did not understand the nature of the trade between our two countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465172">The U.S. government's decision on Keystone XL shows that Canada's energy trade with our dominant energy trading partner is expendable. That is not comfort. That is real risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465173">Canada-U.S. trade was solidified three decades ago by leaders on both sides who understood how strong we were together. This government alludes to a special relationship with the incoming U.S. administration. If so, it needs to be utilized. The initial results are discouraging. If they are not solving big issues together as two leading democracies that are also interdependent should be, clearly something has been lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465174">The outcome here is severe for our country. We have an economy that will not grow as a result of what has happened here nearly as much as it should. Our balance of trade will suffer significantly. In 2019, the number was $16 billion that we took because of the differential we received on our main resource that we export. Our balance of trade siphoning off Canadian value to other countries is huge and is going to continue to grow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465175">Jobs are being exported from Canada because of these decisions. Work here is being cancelled. Workers here are being laid off.

              <ParaText id="6465185">I think the other point we want to make here, when we talk about transitioning, is how diversified the actual Alberta economy is. Energy is going to continue to be a part of our world for decades to come, and a good part of that energy will continue to come, as it has continuously here, according to all international organizations, from fossil fuels. Every indication we have is that the Alberta oil output will continue to increase. Finding a market is going to be the main problem, otherwise we will be beholden in the future to foreign sources of oil in the world. This oil is better economically, and this oil is better environmentally. This is the transition we are moving toward with the technology.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465191">Madam Speaker, I am speaking from the island of Newfoundland, the ancestral homeland of the Mi'kmaq and Beothuk, one of Canada's three oil-producing provinces. This is an important debate. It is as important as our oil and gas workers are to the Canadian economy. It is as important as the industry is to the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465192">I want to speak on the record and say that we are disappointed in this decision. We are not happy with this news. There are thousands of workers and their families who will be impacted by this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465193">This is our biggest industry. It is our number one export. We are the fourth-largest producers of oil and gas in the world, and we are good at it. This is not just an Alberta issue or a Saskatchewan issue. This is a Canadian issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465194">The United States is the single largest customer of Canada's biggest export. We have over $100 billion in cross-border energy trade with them. We are their biggest supplier, with 23% of crude consumed in the U.S. coming from Canada. We contribute to American energy security and economic competitiveness, and that supports thousands of jobs on both sides of the border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465195">The U.S. will still need Canadian heavy crude. That does not change with President Biden's decision. The U.S. Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions source crude nearly exclusively from Canada, and Canadian crude represents approximately 70% of the feed stock to refineries in those regions. In October 2020, Canada sent approximately 2.3 million barrels per day to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465196"> This relationship is vital to both countries. We made a strong argument for this project at every level and at every chance we could, from Ambassador Hillman to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The Prime Minister advocated for this project long before he was Prime Minister. Four years ago, in Houston, the Prime Minister said that nothing is more essential to the U.S. economy than access to a secure, reliable source of energy, and Canada is that source. It was true then, and it remains true today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465197">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> brought it up in his very first conversation with the president-elect in November and again just on Friday. He expressed our disappointment with the decision directly with the President. Every week in the fall of 2020, every single week, I was on the phone with Alberta's energy minister and the former member for Edmonton—Leduc James Rajotte to discuss how we could get this project done. We took a team Canada approach. We stood shoulder to shoulder with the Government of Alberta in making the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465198">I ask members to not take it just from me, but to also listen to what Premier Kenney said. He said that he was very happy that the federal <Affiliation DbId="271244" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> had said that Keystone XL was at the top of the U.S. agenda. He said that he was very happy with the strong advocacy by Canada's ambassador to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465199">What now? Where do we go from here? Do we, like some are suggesting, start a trade war with our closest ally and largest trading partner, the single largest customer for Canadian crude?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465200">I have not yet heard a single argument that would convince me that a trade war is in the best interests of our oil and gas workers. We have a responsibility to Albertans to safeguard our relationship with the single largest customer for Canadian crude. There is a difference between illegal tariffs on existing products and the cancellation of a permit for a project that is not yet operational. We will not jeopardize the more than $100 billion in energy products that we export to the United States every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465201">We got this relationship right with an unpredictable presidential administration for the past four years. We will get it right with the predictable one for the next four years, to the benefit of workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and right across Canada. We will not take any lesson from the Conservatives on this, who can share nothing but a legacy of failure from 2006 until 2015. For nearly a decade there was a failure to safeguard our most important trading relationship, a failure to get major projects built, and a failure to even have a strategy. All the Conservatives did was throw public insults and negotiate in the media. They did nothing to support the thousands of energy workers in this country, except beat their chests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465202">Conservatives may not agree, but it is true. We could hear it from former Progressive Conservative prime minister of Canada Joe Clark, who said, “One of the real problems that I think lingers over [Keystone XL] is, before the pipeline question arose, the [Harper] Government...deliberately went out of his way to be seen as an adversary of environmentalists.” The Conservative record of inaction, and their record of open hostility on the environment, helped doom this project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465203"> There are also some in this House who think this decision is good news. In fact, there are some in this House who are jumping up and down with joy in this decision. That shocks me. They could not be more wrong. Their lack of concern for the thousands of workers and their families that this decision impacts is shocking.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465204">Other parties in the House claim to be the parties of workers. Keystone XL would have created thousands of good-paying union jobs on both sides of the border. I invite my colleagues on the other side who claim to stand for workers to join me in expressing disappointment with the President's decision. Join me in lamenting the loss of good union jobs in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Join me in having the backs of oil and gas workers. I know where I stand on this side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465205">What we will do is have our workers' backs. We will stand up and support our oil and gas workers, as I am doing today and just as we have done since 2015. Let us talk TMX. We approved it. We bought it. We are building it. It has already created over 7,000 jobs. We approved NOVA Gas and NGTL 2021. Thousands more jobs were created in Alberta. We approved the Line 3 pipeline. Another 7,000 jobs were created. There was also $1.7 billion to Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C. to clean up abandoned and inactive wells, reducing emissions and keeping oil and gas workers on the job. There was $320 million to support workers and lower emissions in the Newfoundland offshore. Every step of the way, we are laser focused on jobs and on workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465206">In the toughest of times when the sector was hit with a double whammy of a global price war and a global pandemic, we had its back with the wage subsidy. That single measure kept more than 500,000 workers in their jobs during the pandemic in Alberta alone. Saskatchewan kept 32,000 workers. These are men and women who found a way to get oil out of sand. That is a remarkable thing. We need the same ingenuity, hard work and determination that our oil and gas workers show every day in our mission to lower emissions and maintain a growing and prosperous economy in this country that leaves no one behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465207">I am proud of those workers. We need them now more than ever. We have a tremendous opportunity to work with an administration that is not only aligned with our priorities on climate and clean growth at the federal level, but is also very much aligned with the priorities of the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, where I am proud to say net-zero legislation recently passed unanimously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465208">Lowering our emissions with an aim of getting to net zero by 2050 is not a barrier to investment in our energy sector. It is a competitive necessity because the markets are changing. We can see that investors are making clear choices. They are putting their money into countries that are taking action on climate change seriously, and they are divesting from those that in their view are not doing enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465209">The reality is that the industry knows this. It understands the direction that the markets are moving. It is why the Keystone XL of 2021 is not the same as the Keystone XL of 2015. When a company like TC Energy has the courage to go back to the drawing board and find ways to make its project greener, to make it net zero, to power pump stations with renewable energy, that sends a clear message. It is about skating to where the puck is going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465210">Canadian oil and gas is already being produced under some of the most stringent environmental and climate policy frameworks in the world, and Canadian oil and gas companies are leading the way. Husky, Cenovus, CNRL, Suncor and Shell are just a few of the companies that see net zero as part of their future and a key part of their economic competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465211">The Canadian petroleum sector is by far our country's largest investor in clean tech, routinely accounting for more than 70% of all private-sector investment in clean tech: more than $1 billion every year. BMO Capital Markets tells us that Canada's oil and gas sector is already leading the world in ESG performance. This is a finding that has been supported by studies at Yale and the World Bank. All of this matters because, by all accounts, Canadian oil and gas will continue to be a part of the world's energy mix for some time yet. None of that would have been possible without the hard work that we have done when it comes to reconciliation, diversity, inclusion and reaching our environmental targets.</ParaText>

The Electoral College had not yet met, but it was evident that President Biden was going to be the next president of the United States. We clearly knew, from the platform he had put forward during the election campaign, that he would cancel Keystone XL on day one. Conservatives brought forward a request for an emergency debate at that time and it was rejected. Today, it was accepted. However, in the meantime, the Liberals had an opportunity, knowing what was probably about to happen, to do something about it and make some efforts. It really appears as though nothing happened in that whole period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465216">I would ask the minister what the government did in that period of time to try to avoid this happening, and to advocate for Keystone XL?

To reach net-zero operations by making sure that pumping stations had solar or wind power, making sure that we worked with unions on both sides of the border, and making sure that we worked with indigenous communities on both sides of the border, improved that project demonstrably. We made a solid case.

A predominant amount of our emissions does come from the energy sector, downstream and upstream, so that is where we are concentrating a significant amount of our effort. We will do whatever it takes to lower emissions wherever we find them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465225">Madam Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> spoke time and time again in his speech about getting to net zero. The Canada energy regulator under his ministry put out a report before Christmas that provided a projection of where Canadian oil production needed to go, and where pipeline capacity needed to go, under a scenario where we did something about climate action. It was not a scenario where we would meet net zero, but it was a scenario on climate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465226">Under that scenario, which they called the evolving scenario, it was clear that we only needed one of the three big expansion pipelines that are on the books now: Line 3, Keystone and the Trans Mountain expansion. We only need one of those three to meet any possible capacity issues for the future. However, it seems that the sky is falling because Keystone XL would not be needed if Line 3 comes online at the end of this year. We would not need it. We would not need Trans Mountain. We would not need further oil-by-rail capacity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465228">Madam Speaker, one of the reasons we are getting so exercised about this issue is because thousands of people are unemployed as a result of it, or could be.

              <ParaText id="6465229">I would also make the argument that while we may own the pipeline that is heading west in TMX, we do not own the pipeline that is heading south with KXL in this case. The market has an important role here. It is the leading role in determining how investment decisions should be made, but it is our government's duty to set the parameters on that and to incent what we believe to be extraordinarily important goals, namely net-zero emissions by 2050. That is the goal we have set for ourselves, and many of our friends, colleagues and competitors around the world have also set that goal for themselves. This is an existential crisis, there is no question. It is also an economic one for many people in this country who feel that they may be left behind. We cannot allow that to happen.</ParaText>

I would no more say that people who are supporting the oil sands are deliberately and consciously threatening my grandchildren's future than I would say it was right to be celebrating as though it does not matter when people suffer an immediate downturn in their economic prospects.

              <ParaText id="6465237">Madam Speaker, I would perhaps like to begin by saying that I really feel for Alberta's workers. I really feel for them because we went through basically the same thing in the forestry sector that they are going through right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465238">The pulp and paper industry completely fell apart in the 1990s. In the forestry sector, trade wars wiped out nearly half the harvesting community's major players. The crisis caused a great deal of distress among the workers in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465239">When I was young, my father taught me that it is always best to tell the truth. However, since being elected to the House in October 2019, I have been under the impression, considering the Liberal and Conservative one-upmanship, that no one wants to tell Albertans the truth. It is a hard truth, but simple to understand. Because of climate change, most large investment funds are moving away from fossil fuels. Many countries are turning away from fossil fuels, seeking a more carbon-neutral economy and new green energy technologies. I think we need to be honest with Albertans and tell them frankly that this industry is, in the medium to short term, doomed to failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465240">I have seen many such failures since coming to the House. I saw it with Teck Frontier, when the Liberals and Conservatives engaged in mutual finger pointing. One blamed the other for not taking action. The Liberals said that the Conservatives had done no better when they were in power. Each blamed the other instead of accepting reality and responding in the best way possible: planning the transition for Albertans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465241">The same thing happened with Keystone XL. In 2015, the Obama administration said it would not go ahead with the project.

              <ParaText id="6465246">I believe that the Alberta government was very misguided to invest $1.5 billion in a project that may have been doomed to failure. In my opinion, it created a frenzy of support for the fossil fuel sector that many Canadian politicians joined because it seemed like a winning political move in the west. We may occasionally win by lying to people, but it never pays off in the end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465247">I want to point out that I really empathize with Alberta's workers. I also want to mention how shocked I was when I arrived in the House of Commons in October and heard many Conservative colleagues repeatedly shout, “Build the pipeline!” This call to build pipelines was being repeated constantly, and I want to remind members that this was at a time when Canada was divided. We were being told that there were deep divisions between the west and the east, and the east did not understand that the west wanted to sell its oil. Having followed what happened to the forestry industry very closely, I have to say that this bothered me, since I have extensively studied a phenomenon known as Dutch disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465248"> In the early 2000s, the Quebec economy was completely destabilized by the Canadian oil economy. The rising dollar meant that Quebec's manufacturing sector was no longer competitive. If I am not mistaken, 55,000 jobs were lost in Quebec from 2002 to 2007. The Quebec economy very much paid the price for the oil industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465249">The story I keep hearing, that the generous equalization payments made possible by Alberta oil have helped fund social programs, would make the average Quebec nationalist's hair stand on end. In fact, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252509" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> has told me a few times that Canadian taxpayers are not Quebeckers' ATM card, which is along the same lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465250">There are many things about the oil industry that might be irritating to the average Quebecker and cause grievances, but let us not focus on that too much. I believe we should instead put our heads together and find a solution for Alberta's economic transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465251">There is a solution. The Standing Committee on Natural Resources held six meetings on the forestry industry, where we heard from many stakeholders who spoke about the bioeconomy. The bioeconomy involves recovering forestry and agricultural waste to replace almost all petrochemical products. Stéphane Renou from FP Innovations spoke about a wonderful opportunity for Albertan expertise, since Alberta already has a workforce of chemical engineers. What a wonderful opportunity for these people to get involved in the energy transition, be part of a new niche and develop an economy that will no longer rely solely on fossil materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465252">Unfortunately, Canada's strategy in that regard is non-existent. We all know, and many stakeholders confirmed, that the transition to the bioeconomy requires a lot of capital. Companies cannot make that transition alone. A national strategy is needed. Canada implemented this sort of national strategy in the late 1970s or early 1980s. As members may have guessed, the national strategy in question sought to make the oil sands profitable because we did not have the technology to do so at the start. In all, $70 billion was collectively invested, 20% of which came from Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465253">Why not make the decision to support Alberta's economy in a different way by promoting the bioeconomy and getting involved in industries that are less harmful to the environment and have a smaller carbon footprint?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465254">In closing, I have been having some fun with these numbers over the past few months. I did some research into what has been invested in the oil industry and the forestry industry over the past four years, and I came up with two numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465255">Over the past four years, the federal government has given the oil and gas industry $24 billion, $12 billion of which was used to buy the pipeline. The government invested $950 million in the entire Canadian forestry industry over that same period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465256">Crunching those investment numbers, it turns out that 75% of that amount is loans. These two natural resource sectors prove that there really is a double standard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465257">I have just a minute left, so I will quickly close with a simple warning. If a member of the House suggests replacing Keystone XL with Energy East, I promise that member will run up against the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465259">Earlier on the member mentioned that Albertans always say that we need to build pipelines. It is true, because it is so important. However, one of the other things that was said is that we were there to protect Quebec as well. We stood up for the aluminum industry and talked about how it was important to be able to sell that product around the world. We did that because of the fact Quebec can do it in an environmentally friendly way, just as Alberta oil is done in an environmentally friendly way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465275">Madam Speaker, I will start off by saying that I really did not think my first speech of 2021 would be given during an emergency debate about a decision our American neighbours made. I would have preferred an emergency debate about a green, fair recovery. I think that would be more apropos, and that is what we should be aiming for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465276">Of course, U.S. President Joe Biden's wise decision is not uncontroversial. Many people are unhappy about it, including the Premier of Alberta, and it has left many politicians feeling perplexed even though President Biden made promises about the project during his election campaign and kept them. For years, Joe Biden has made no bones about his position on the project and his commitment to protecting the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465277">His decision, the reason we are still here this evening, is a clear break with the administration of his predecessor, Donald Trump, on the issue of fighting climate change. It should come as no surprise to anyone. Our climate reality is nothing short of critical, and anyone who believes the experts, the science and the data collected around the world on this subject welcomes Joe Biden's decision as excellent news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465278">However, the problem—and I am not sure how to explain it anymore—is that while the Keystone XL project does create jobs, it is an extension of an existing pipeline. We do not need to expand pipeline networks, but rather transition away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465279">These past few months I have already talked about the impressive, even encouraging, number of central banks and private investors that have definitively shifted their funds towards other energy portfolios. Instead of starting over again, let us turn our attention to another subject, namely the uneasiness that some people feel about this courageous decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465280">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is disappointed, but should he not be thrilled about such a decision being prioritized? After all, this makes the new President of the United States an unequivocal ally of the man who, here in Canada, presents himself as a champion for climate change. Instead, the Prime Minister has claimed that the last five years have shown that investing in oil and gas and fighting climate change can go hand in hand. It is incredible to me that anyone would put all of that in the same sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465281">We think President Biden has guts because this decision comes with its share of controversy and sticking points. At least he has the courage to make fighting climate change a priority in his administration, right behind dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465282">As we know, the pandemic is worrisome in the United States. The lax attitude of the previous administration will have consequences, as will Trump's climate change denial. The U.S. economy will go through dark periods and U.S. and Canadian elected officials will have to devote a lot of attention to ensuring employment stability. We want jobs and we do not want to see Albertans or anyone else suffer as a result of this project ending, although that is inevitable I am afraid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465283">However, I wonder why Alberta Premier Jason Kenney sunk so much public money into this project. Why did he not instead invest that money in retraining workers in the oil and gas sector and developing geothermal energy? How could he not know the current extent of climate change and the scientific projections of what lies ahead for us? How could he not know that the good old days of developing crude bitumen, the most polluting fossil fuel there is, are over? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465284">President Biden's decision is based on two things. First, he has real concerns about climate change. Second, domestic production in the United States makes them 95% independent so the existing pipelines are sufficient. As far as the well-paying, unionized jobs that the leader of the official opposition was talking about are concerned, that is on Mr. Kenney and TransCanada PipeLines. In the United States, the Biden administration has announced a $2-trillion-U.S. climate plan.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465285">The will to innovate and develop certain sectors of the economy will foster the creation of different jobs that will likely be compatible with the trades required for Keystone XL. I have already spoken about skills used in the fossil fuel sector that are transferable to renewable energies such as geothermal, solar and wind. I wager that American teams will quickly move to plan B, which will promote a greener economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465286">I have trouble understanding what we are accomplishing by holding an emergency debate on a decision made by President Biden. To be honest, I want to ask my hon. colleagues to not just respect the new president's commendable decision, but to be inspired by it. Yes, we should be inspired. When a promise is made, it must be kept. Even if it is not popular, a promise must be kept if the person who made it is elected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465287">For more than 60 years, Alberta's economy has been used to turn profits for oil companies and create prosperity for Albertans. However, this prosperity is coming to an end. Successive governments all bet on a resource that they believed to be inexhaustible. Even the Heritage Savings Trust Fund did so, but I think we would feel discouraged if we were to talk about it. Did Mr. Kenney fail to carefully think through his commitments? When it comes to energy and natural resources, public money should only be used to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465288">I have news for my colleagues who say that Biden's decision weakened our trade relations with our neighbours. Access to renewable energy resources and expertise will be a perfect fit for the Americans. The daily newspaper Le Devoir explored this at length in its “perspectives” column last Saturday. Although it is a daunting task, greening the U.S. economy is not impossible. A challenge of this magnitude ought not be politicized, and the same could be said for the Canadian economy. This welcome transformation of the world's largest economy could also stimulate the development of renewable energy in Canada. There you have it; that is all that needs to be said, at least for tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465289">Could we listen to reason and to science, research, international organizations, experts who protect our environment, as well as investors and banks? The oil sands are finished.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465305">We are meeting here this evening to debate the significance of the decision by President Biden to cancel the permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have provided an increased capacity for shipments from Alberta to refineries on the U.S. Gulf coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465306">The Liberals and the Conservatives both claim that this will be a serious blow to the Alberta economy. I think the minister, with maybe a bit of Newfoundland hyperbole, said it was going to be an existential blow. While it is certainly true that the oil sector in Alberta has suffered a number of blows that have impacted tens of thousands of workers over the past six or seven years, mainly involving the world oil price and global investments, it is clear that this is not one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465307">I think everyone in the debate today would agree that we must act quickly to ensure that workers in the oil sector can find jobs that they can count on over the coming years. The question, then, is this: What actions will produce those long-lasting jobs for the future? Will building more pipelines produce those jobs? Or should we be creating jobs to transition out of the fossil fuel industry into a future that tackles climate change with bold investments in energy efficiency, oil and gas well cleanup and clean-energy technologies? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465308">As members may guess, I think that doubling down on pipelines is a waste of time, a waste of money and, most of all, a huge disservice to the future of oil patch workers. I would like to take a bit of time to explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465309">In 2014, oil prices dropped from about $100 a barrel to the $40 or $50 range. Those prices tumbled further last year as COVID hit, but have since recovered to around $50. Over the past five years, I have heard at committee from many top oil executives about their needs in the sector. When l have asked them what prices we need to make new projects financially viable, the answers have always been around $70 or $80. I do not think there is a single analyst in the world who would predict that we will see prices in that range over the next 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465310">When we had Irving Oil before the committee in the last Parliament, witnesses were asked whether they would build new refinery capacity for Alberta bitumen if the energy east pipeline was built to tidewater in New Brunswick. Their reply was basically they would have to look at the economic viability of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465311">However, it is not just low prices that have affected the oil sector. Projections for future oil demand have fallen every year, and as those demand projections fall, investors have become very concerned about putting significant money into big new projects that cost billions of dollars and take decades to pay off. They are happy to put money into companies that are actively producing oil, but not into new projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465312">We have seen this in big companies, like Total, one of the biggest companies in France, which wrote down over $9 billion of oil sands assets last year, stranded assets that it figures it will never be able to viably develop. This is not because of lack of pipelines, but because of lack of demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465313">We will need oil over the next 30 years at least, but we will not need any more of it than we are already producing. All these big pipeline projects are expansion projects. Keystone XL, the Trans Mountain expansion and the Enbridge Line 3 expansion are based on the premise that oil sands production of expensive, difficult-to-refine oil will boom during a time when the world is awash in cheap oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465314">More and more, we are seeing that this future is very unlikely. Just before Christmas, the Canada Energy Regulator put out its report on Canada's energy future. For the first time, it projected oil demand into the future based on the assumption that Canada and other countries will actually try to tackle climate change. This so-called evolving scenario was based on Canada's announced policies to fight climate change, not policies that will get us to net zero by 2050. The CER did not go that far, but these policies would at least recognize that we had to move in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465315">Under those assumptions the report showed that oil sands production in Canada would plateau very quickly and that only one of those three pipelines would be needed to accommodate all further production increases. Since Line 3 is scheduled to be online later this year, it follows that Keystone XL will not be needed by Canada's oil producers. The Trans Mountain expansion will not be needed, nor will expanded rail transport.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465316">When I last spoke with Canadian pipeline industry representatives, I asked them how much more capacity we needed to transport Canadian oil. They said that Line 3 would fix all our needs with respect to the capacity constraints we have been seeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465317">The narrative we hear tonight is that if only we had Keystone XL, all would be well with the oil industry; if only we had the Trans Mountain expansion, all would be well. It is clear that this is simply not the case. Even industry analysts know this well. Rystad Energy, a respected Norwegian analyst of the global oil sector, notes that shutting down the Keystone project would have almost no effect on the Canadian oil production sector, as we simply have enough capacity lined up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465318"> What should we be doing to help the tens of thousands of oil industry workers who have lost their jobs? We should be creating tens of thousands of jobs now, not next year and not in five years. If we respect the workers who have lost jobs, that is what we have to do, and we can do that with a major effort to clean up oil and gas wells.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465319">The federal government made a start to that last year, but we really have to ramp that up. We could create good jobs across the country in energy-efficiency efforts. The government's plan in this regard is the $2 billion that was announced in the economic statement before Christmas. However, Efficiency Canada has recommended spending 10 times that to ensure our buildings are energy efficient by 2050. These jobs would be the same jobs that are being lost in the oil sector as new projects are scaled back, for welders, electricians, carpenters, plumbers and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465320">Estimates show that even if we met the old goals of the pan-Canadian framework for energy efficiency, we would create over a million jobs. These are of course jobs in clean energy and clean technology, good jobs that closely match the jobs that have been lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465321">This is what we should be talking about when talking to the United States government. This is where Canadian industries can cash in on the huge expenditures the U.S. and countries around the world are talking about. If we want to negotiate with the U.S. on future trade, let us talk about where the future is going as far as technology goes. Let us make sure that Canada has access to the ambitious programs that the Biden administration has planned in sectors where Canada is already experienced and is often leading the way, like hydrogen technology, electric vehicle manufacturing and clean energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465322">This is where the puck is going and this is where we need to go with our investments and policies. This is where good jobs are going to be created. If we respect the workers who are looking desperately for those jobs, this is what we need to do. Another pipeline will not get us there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465327">Madam Speaker, with regard to the economics of Canadian oil, most of it has to be burned out of the oil sands in Alberta, which automatically makes it more expensive. I know that cost has been coming down and the Alberta industry has been working hard to bring down greenhouse gas emissions from that process, but that is the big difference in bringing down the price of Canadian oil. That is why the Biden administration cancelled those permits. It was for no other reason than the fact that, on average, Canadian oil coming out of the oil sands produces about 73 kilograms of carbon dioxide per barrel compared with about 19 kilograms of carbon dioxide for U.S. shale oil. That is one of the differences.</ParaText>

I am happy that the government basically brought back the Harper-era ecoENERGY retrofit program with an investment of $1 billion or so. That is great, but it is not where we need to go if we want to have all of our buildings energy efficient by 2050. If we want to meet that net-zero target by 2050, we have to invest $20 billion and employ a lot of people, and we need to train those people. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465336">Madam Speaker, as the granddaughter of one of the notorious McCoy brothers who helped build the oil and gas sector in Alberta, as the daughter of a former trucker who worked in the oil patch making sure that my brothers and I had what we needed to thrive, as the sister of a heavy equipment cleaner and the wife of someone who is employed in the pipeline business, no one has to tell me how important oil and gas has been to Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465337">I grew up with truckers and oilmen sitting around my kitchen table, and I am so proud of these hard-working Albertans who helped build our province and our nation. Generations of Albertans have enjoyed the prosperity that has come from this natural resource, and Alberta has thrived as a result. I am proud of the contributions Alberta has made to our country and the generations of Canadians who have also benefited from our oil and gas sector. However, the past is not the future and it is not even the present in Alberta right now. In Alberta, folks are losing their jobs and have been for years. It is devastating and I am completely gutted when I think of the Alberta families that are suffering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465338">Climate change is real. In fact, climate change is the most profound threat of our time and we cannot stick our head in the sand and pretend otherwise. As the world reckons with global climate change and turns away from fossil fuels to lower carbon forms of energy, Alberta is facing an economic calamity and instead of taking climate change seriously, instead of showing global investors that Alberta has a legitimate and robust climate strategy, a strategy that corporations like Cenovus, Shell and Total have called for, Jason Kenney and the Conservatives just keep yelling like spoiled children that it is not fair. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465339">Alberta needs an economy that does not rely so heavily on one resource sector. Albertans have lived through boom and bust cycles for generations, and now we know once and for all that the next boom is not going to come. It is not going to come like it did the past. Even if oil and gas continue at 100% capacity, the jobs are not there. The sector is automating. When we hear catch phrases like “efficiencies”, it means there are fewer jobs for Alberta workers, fewer jobs for hard-working Albertans and their families, and everyone in this room knows that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465340">We have a choice to make. We can put on blinders and double down on the past, or we can work to ensure that Canadian workers have a future. Jason Kenney is doubling down on the past. He is betting on coal and putting the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains at risk. For a handful of short-term jobs, he is selling off our iconic Rocky Mountains to an Australian billionaire. He is risking the livelihoods of ranchers, farmers and tourism operators. He is risking the endangered species that people travel from around the world to see. He is risking the water, the very water that people in southern Alberta need to survive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465341">He is taking a gamble with Alberta resources, and I have to say as an Albertan who deeply loves my province, Mr. Kenney has a gambling problem and I am tired of his using Alberta taxpayer dollars to pay his bad gambling debts. He gambled somewhere between $1.5 billion and $6 billion of Alberta's money on Donald Trump. We do not know yet because he will not tell us, but remember that when Jason Kenney gambled on Donald Trump, he did not gamble his own money, but ours, and when he lost that gamble, when he lost that money, he did not lose his money, but ours. Let that sink in. The premier of Alberta gambled our money on the hopes that a racist, misogynistic, horrible human being would win the election in the United States of America. That was his job plan for Alberta. That was his plan to get jobs for workers in my province. Now he wants to start a trade war with the U.S., the customer for 95% of our energy exports.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465343">No one was surprised when President Biden cancelled the Keystone XL pipeline expansion. In fact, anyone who thought differently was either lying to themselves or lying to Canadians. Biden told us he was going to cancel it. Biden was Obama's vice-president and Obama told us he was going to cancel it. Trump did not even get it built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465344">The reason Jason Kenney threw billions of taxpayer dollars at the project was that smart money, investor money, was not prepared to invest in it. Pumping more and more public money into dying projects that investors will no longer support is not the way to give Albertans a future. Helping Alberta to diversify our economy is the only way we can secure future prosperity, including refining and upgrading our products, investing in well reclamation, investing in hydrogen and other energy alternatives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465369">I will focus my remarks tonight on the importance of our Canada-U.S. bilateral relations, our largest trading partner and neighbour to the south. Tonight's debate is very important for Canadians across Canada because of the nature of our relationship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465370">On a personal level, I had the fortune to live and work in the United States for a number of years, and I learned a lot. Obviously, I came back to live in the country I was born in and have continued as such, but it was an experience I am richer for. It improved my development in terms of my career and gave me so many opportunities, and I am blessed for that. I made many friends and I have many relatives in the United States. I know how important our relationship is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465371">Canada and the United States have long enjoyed one of the most productive, collaborative, mutually beneficial bilateral relationships in the world. It is a partnership of neighbours forged by shared geography, similar values, common interests, deep people-to-people connections and powerful, multi-layered economic and security ties. Our two countries enjoy the largest trading relationship in the world. We defend and protect North America together. We are stewards of our shared environment. We stand on the world stage to respond to pressing global challenges together, which is especially true in times of crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465372">We know that the spread of COVID-19 has caused upheaval in both Canada and the United States, and we have taken unprecedented action to combat the pandemic, support our citizens and stabilize both economies. Last March, Canada and the United States arrived at a far-reaching agreement to limit discretionary and recreational travel across the border, an understanding that has been extended by mutual agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465373">The magnitude of this decision cannot be overstated. Ours is one of the busiest land borders in the world, with approximately 400,000 people crossing it on any given day and over $2 billion of goods and services flow between our two countries. The smooth flow of people and goods across this border is vitally important to both economies and communities on both sides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465374"> In the face of such high stakes, our two countries collaborated in an orderly fashion and quickly arrived at an agreement aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. The agreement has resulted in a 90% reduction in the number of travellers crossing the border while maintaining the flow of essential goods. This collaboration set the tone for subsequent co-operation in getting our citizens home, ensuring the continued operation of our supply chains or assisting each other in the production and procurement of medical supplies and other essential goods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465375">A striking example has been our co-operation to procure personal protective equipment. As in so many other countries, Canada-U.S. trade in PPE is bilateral and reciprocal. Our collaboration allowed for the smooth flow of PPE across the border and into the hands of health care workers in both countries. Canadian and American partners are also working together and investing in research to combat the virus with collaboration on 15 different diagnostic and vaccine projects. Hundreds of Canadian manufacturers have retooled and shifted their production and provided innovative solutions to address shortages in medical equipment and protective personal equipment. This is critical for the health of both our populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465376">Canadians and Americans have depended on each other for decades, from the Halifax explosion to the beaches of northern France in World War II, from the hours and days following September 11, 2001, attacks to the wildfires that devastated California and Oregon this fall. Canadians and Americans have faced the great challenges of the continent and the world side by side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465377"> Today, hundreds of members of the Canadian Armed Forces continue to serve alongside their U.S. allies from across America. The job of protecting the North American homeland continues under the watchful eye of Canadian and American aviators, sailors, soldiers, police officers and firefighters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465378">Another element of our close collaboration is the intervening nature of our energy systems. We know that the United States is Canada's most important market for energy. In turn, Canada is the largest and most secure foreign source of energy for the United States, including crude oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity and uranium. This means that it is mutually beneficial to ensure this supply is secure, reliable and sustainable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465379">The government recognizes the critical role energy plays in our trade relationship. Jobs, economic security and competitiveness on both sides of the border depend on our bilateral energy trade. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> raised Canada's disappointment on the decision of the United States on the Keystone XL pipeline in his telephone conversation with President Biden on Friday. The Prime Minister underscored the important economic and security benefits of our bilateral energy relationship as well as his support for energy workers. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465380">A further element that unites us is our shared natural environment. For example, Canada and the U.S. share many waterways that mark or cross our shared border, from the Great Lakes to rivers such as the mighty St. Lawrence. The shores of these lakes and rivers are home to tens of millions of Americans and Canadians, and decisions made within the basins of one country have consequences for the other. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465381">Hence, their joint stewardship is a cornerstone of Canada-U.S. relations. This stretches back to the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, the world's first environmental agreement, to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which continues to address the environmental challenges of the 21st century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465382"> Of course, we cannot forget the essential economic collaboration that brings us together. While many of my esteemed colleagues will go into more detail on the importance of this co-operation, suffice it to say that our deeply integrated supply chains contribute to a distinct North American advantage and foster millions of jobs on both sides of the border. Cementing this advantage is the new North American Free Trade Agreement, which we were able to renew, update and modernize, even with an American president who could be a bit unpredictable and, shall I say, protectionist. That is the strength of the Canada-U.S. trade bond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465383">Finally, we also acknowledge that our societies face similar difficulties and shameful legacies. Canadians grieve alongside our American friends at the tragic loss of George Floyd and the countless others impacted by police violence around the world. These are not isolated incidents or elsewhere problems. Prejudice, discrimination and violence are a lived reality for too many people in Canada as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465384">In the face of these injustices, we must be clear. We condemn anti-Black racism and systemic discrimination. That is what thousands of principled Americans and Canadians have been doing throughout our two centuries, and this is a moment to admire and honour their work. We hear the same calls for a more inclusive and just society here in Canada, where systemic racism is a problem every single day. Canada is not a bystander. As neighbours, this is a burden that our two societies share, and we must do better together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465385">In closing, our government will work with the new Biden administration to advance our shared objectives and protect, yes protect, Canadian interests as we have done for the past four years. We look forward to being able to talk with the new President more about climate change, trade, the COVID response and other shared priorities for our two nations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465413"> Canada and the U.S. have one of the most productive, collaborative, mutually beneficial, bilateral relationships in the world. An essential element of this relationship is energy. I was a member of the natural resources committee from 2015-18, and we heard clearly from witnesses all across the country of the importance of our natural resources in Canada. We know the United States is Canada's most important market for energy. In return, Canada is the largest and most secure foreign source of energy for the United States, including crude oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity and uranium.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465414">In 2019, 91% of Canada's energy exports were destined for the U.S., totalling nearly $125 billion in value. The reverse was also true. Canada is the second-largest market for U.S. energy exports, and these exports play an important role in ensuring Canada has a reliable and secure energy supply. The truth is that Canada and the U.S. have a highly integrated energy infrastructure system, which allows for the optimization of current global competitiveness, benefiting both Canada and the U.S. We know that the energy sector provides thousands of well-paying, middle-class jobs on both sides of the border.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465415">Canada is the United States' largest, safest, most reliable and most competitive supplier of oil and gas, including crude oil, refined oil products and natural gas. Here are some enlightening facts. In 2019, Canada supplied 56% of the United States' crude oil imports, accounting for 23% of U.S. consumption. Canada also supplied 9% of the natural gas used in the U.S. One in five barrels of oil consumed in the United States comes from Canada. The United States imports more oil from Canada than from all OPEC countries combined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465416">Canadian crude oil accounts for the majority of the oil refined in the U.S., and those products drive the American manufacturing sector and are exported around the world. Canada is one of the only major suppliers of oil to the United States that has a price on carbon and a 2050 net-zero target. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465417">An essential element of this energy system is the energy infrastructure, including pipelines. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said directly to President Biden during their meeting last week, we are disappointed, but we acknowledge the President's decision to keep his election promise and revoke the presidential permits for the Keystone XL project. We have raised the importance of this project several times. We discussed it directly with President Biden recently and in November, as well as several times with senior officials in the incoming administration, including in the days leading up to his inauguration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465418">That being said, Canadian oil already flows through more than 70 pipelines, creating one of the most integrated energy systems in the world between two countries. We maintain that to continue providing and improving the benefits of Canadian oil and gas to the United States, we must build and maintain the necessary infrastructure to get the products to where they are needed. As far as electricity is concerned, Canadian hydroelectricity exports provide many U.S. states with a clean, renewable, solid base load 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6465419">Electricity crosses the U.S.-Canada border along more than 30 major transmission lines unrestricted by physical or tariff barriers as part of an effective, efficient, highly integrated North American energy grid. This highly integrated system benefits both Canada and the United States. Operators consistently take advantage of spare energy capacity in neighbouring jurisdictions to optimize their systems. Ratepayers benefit from a more reliable and resilient electrical system that expands the international border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465420">In 2019, Canada exported over 60 teratonnes of hours of electricity to the U.S., the equivalent of powering almost six million U.S. homes. Those exports save American households, consumers and companies hundreds of millions of dollars each year on their electricity bills. Canadian hydro also contributes to U.S. energy security and helps states meet critical GHG emission reduction targets and to move to a low-carbon economy. With regard to uranium, Canada supplies the U.S. with 33% of the fuel used for its reactors, which in turn generate 20% of U.S. electricity. Industry and government in both countries are also collaborating on developing advanced nuclear technology, including the next small modular reactors that the natural resources committee studied at great length a few years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465421">In the current context of a global pandemic, it is more important than ever that we work closely to ensure a secure, reliable, sustainable supply of energy sources for North America and the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465449">Madam Speaker, I will split my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="253140" Type="2">Regina—Lewvan</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465450">I am grateful to participate in this emergency debate, which is of course of great national importance in general but also to the people I represent in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465451">The new U.S. president's decision to cancel the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline is not remotely surprising, but it is a short-sighted political move that ignores evidence, economics and common sense, as was the case the first time around when he was vice-president. With the stroke of a pen, thousands of people are out of work in the middle of a global crisis, and the transportation opportunities for world-class Canadian oil are set back yet again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465452">I am speaking as I always do: for the people who have been out of work or who are scraping by with inconsistent work, who are suddenly out of a job with few places to turn, for families and communities whose futures are precarious, all through no fault of their own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465453">Canadians whose livelihoods depend on the oil and gas sector are rightly anxious about their futures and are struggling with complete and utter financial despair. Entire communities are in fact at risk because of the policy- and legislative-driven historic levels of bankruptcies and the decline in investment in Canadian oil and gas. That damage ripples through other sectors, risks jobs and harms businesses right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465454">Since 2015, more than 200,000 jobs have been lost in Canada's energy sector. The devastation is real in more ways than one. In Alberta alone, a recent University of Calgary study said that for every 1% increase in unemployment, 16 Albertans will die by suicide. Never has a Canadian industry faced such a severe triple threat: global oversupply and demand drops, a collapse of global prices and a self-imposed lack of market access, domestic policies designed to drive investment away, killing businesses and jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465455">It is bad enough when the U.S. president and other American legislators block Canadian energy infrastructure despite the economic security, political and continental ties between our countries, and that the reality is that the U.S. sits on tens of thousands of kilometres of pipeline networks and is a major oil importer from Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465456">The decision is not a surprise to anyone when we consider the domestic political considerations of the new president. Also, this decision is perfectly aligned with the best interests of the United States. The U.S. is currently a world-leading energy exporter and producer and put the policy framework in place for the private sector to enable the U.S. to become rapidly energy independent and self-sufficient, an objective that actually started under the previous Democrat administration when the current president was vice-president and was expedited and secured under the most recent administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465457">What is most galling of all is how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada and the Liberal government have done virtually nothing to fight for KXL and have put Canada in such a vulnerable and powerless position. Certainly the Liberals have turned their backs on Canadian energy workers and their families and are ignoring the disproportionate pain and damage they have caused to Albertans, but that is not new.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465458">The reality is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has never actually championed the KXL pipeline. It should chill everyone that despite close ideological ties between the Prime Minister and the U.S. president, and despite a number of aggressive measures in the pursuit of the sham of social licence that the Prime Minister has imposed on Canada, including currently pushing a legislative framework that is almost unparalleled around the world and KXL's proponent saying the pipeline will be at net zero, it was killed on arrival.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465459">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s weak response to former president Obama's Keystone veto in 2015 was to simply say that he was “disappointed”. He failed to correct the repeated myth that Canadian oil is “dirty”, especially at a time when the U.S. imported record levels of Canadian oil, more than it ever had before in the history of its country at that same time. The Prime Minister did not bother to point that out either. He failed to correct the record on Canada's stronger environmental standards for oil and gas and that Canada is a long-time environmental leader in responsible energy development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465460">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> failed to make the case for KXL to American decision-makers then and now, and he failed to support TransCanada in the courts, in the States or through the NAFTA dispute resolution mechanism at all times in between. Of course this is all easy and obvious to understand. The Prime Minister just does not actually want this pipeline to be built. He said himself that he wants to phase out the oil sands. He has blocked pipelines and targeted Canadian oil and gas with harmful policies repeatedly. His inaction on KXL in 2015 and now in 2021 just proves the point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465461">What is blindingly clear, and Conservatives have been warning about this for some time, is that Canada must urgently get new export pipelines to new markets beyond the United States. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465462">The brutal reality is that if the Liberals had not vetoed the northern gateway pipeline, deliberately killing thousands of jobs, dozens of benefit agreements with indigenous communities and the only stand-alone option for export to the Asia-Pacific for Canada, and if the Liberals had not intervened politically to kill the only private sector west-to-east pipeline proposal that could have secured Canadian energy independence while reaching European markets with double standards, last-minute regulatory changes and hurdles, Canada would actually have two new export pipelines to markets other than the U.S. right now. However, the Liberals killed both of them, so now the Canadian <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, the very minister who should be pushing for this project the most, said that we must simply “respect the decision”, and Canada's ambassador to the U.S. says everyone should move on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465463">Conservatives have backed Keystone XL every single step of the way. The independent National Energy Board and the Conservative government approved Keystone XL in 2010, and in 2012 the former Conservative government launched a major multi-year lobbying effort that successfully secured the support of the majority of U.S. lawmakers. After the Liberals were in government in 2016, the Conservatives called on them to support TransCanada's NAFTA appeal of a Keystone XL veto, but the Liberals were MIA. The previous administration made a common sense, fact-based decision, put economic best interests, the Canada-U.S. partnership and the standard of living and energy security of North Americans ahead of anti-energy ideology and short-sighted activism by reversing the previous veto. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465464">Now here we are, back where we were in 2016 because the Liberal government will not actually fight for pipelines. That should be an important point to the whole country, because the lack of capacity to bring Canadian oil and gas to more international markets is a national economic crisis. The discount on Canadian oil cost Canada hundreds of thousands of jobs in the energy and manufacturing sectors. It is decreasing the value of Canada's financial markets and depriving federal, provincial, territorial and indigenous governments of billions of dollars in lost revenue long into the future, but that is the consequence of the Liberals' decision to kill new Canadian pipelines to export markets, and the real travesty is that they did it while the U.S. ramped up its own domestic production and removed its own ban on exporting American crude oil in its own interests. The Liberals have failed completely to secure Canada's own interests. The U.S. is both Canada's biggest oil and gas competitor as an exporter and Canada's biggest customer for oil and gas, and Canada's energy remains landlocked and captive to U.S. purchasers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465465">The government also stalled the Trans Mountain expansion by extending the regulatory process and by failing in its own process of indigenous consultation. TMX was supposed to be operational by December 2019. Now TMX is not estimated for completion until December 2022, and at least $12.6 billion in Canadian tax dollars have been spent when the private sector proponent only really needed legal and political certainty to proceed. Unfortunately, the reality is that TMX will not even address Canada's market diversification issues, because while the marginal part of its shipments will go to the Asia-Pacific, the vast majority will go to the existing American refinery network.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465466">The tanker ban, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, now law, prevents the potential of pipeline infrastructure for export to the Asia-Pacific as the Liberals designed it to do, and as the private sector economist policy experts and Conservatives warned, the Liberals' no-more-pipelines bill, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, which is now law, will guarantee that no new pipelines will get proposed or manage to get approved in Canada in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465467">Of course, another urgent concern is that Michigan's governor is considering shutting down Line 5. Since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not care about what happens to Alberta, let us hope that he figures out the risk in a hurry and cares about what it would mean for Ontario, because Sarnia's mayor said the city is set to lose 5,000 jobs and cannot risk losing one single job. Six refineries in Ontario and the U.S. Midwest rely on Line 5, and it also supplies all of the fuel to the Pearson airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465468">Scott Archer, the president of UA local 663 in Sarnia, said shutting down Line 5 “would entirely cripple the economy of this region.” While anti-energy activists celebrate the shutdown of these pipelines, the Americans are laughing all the way to the bank, because while our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals were busy blocking energy infrastructure in Canada, the U.S. was on track to become energy independent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465469">The U.S., of course, has rapidly become self-sufficient while also leading the world as the largest oil exporter, but that is because these decisions are not about the environment; they are based on competition and business interests. The Liberals fell for it, and all Canadians have lost as a result. Make no mistake: I do not begrudge the Americans for securing their own energy supply. I am just profoundly angry and mind-boggled that the Canadian government did not do the same in Canada's best interest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465470">Meanwhile, major parts of Canada remain dependent on foreign oil from countries with nowhere near the environmental social governance, regulatory or labour standards, or performance of Canada.

              <ParaText id="6465474">Mr. Speaker, my colleague makes a really good point, especially when we consider that the environment knows no boundaries and that it is a global concern on which there should be local action. Canada, with the most responsible energy sector in the world, which is Canadian oil and gas, could continue to thrive long into the future by ensuring that there was enough capacity to transport Canadian energy products around the world, energy products that the world will continue to need long into the future. As a result of the Liberals' blocking Canada from being able to do that, both here at home and now also failing to make the case to ensure that the Keystone XL pipeline could be built, the reality is that in the long run, the environment is worse off, and that is a real tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465475">I have also listened closely to my colleagues talking about the necessity for investments in clean energy and alternative energy innovation and technology. I would say that I would be surprised if there was a member here who was against those investments, but members should also remember that the largest private sector investors in the innovation and technology that members are calling for is the Canadian oil and gas sector. It is the multi-energy companies that are active in the Canadian energy sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465476">In fact, Alberta alone is one of the provinces that boasts the oldest and largest different kinds of investment in alternative renewable energy.

              <ParaText id="6465485">I have tried to figure out how I am going to speak about the cancellation of the Keystone XL today, and whether I will be very passionate, like the previous speaker from <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>. I want to congratulate her for being chosen as the best representative of her constituents, because I think that is true. She does an amazing job representing the people of Lakeland, and it is a pleasure to follow her. She is an honoured friend and colleague. I thank her very much for the passion she brings to this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465486">Exactly 11 months ago to the day, we were sitting in this chamber having an emergency debate on a similar topic: Teck Frontier. Within a year, we are in an emergency debate on the cancellation of the Keystone XL expansion pipeline. That speaks volumes on how the current government has pursued an energy policy. It speaks about the lack of respect the Liberals have shown to western Canadians, and it speaks about a lack of listening to what the ongoing economic situation is in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465487">The energy sector does not just provide good-paying jobs in western Canada. It provides jobs and income throughout this country. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252566" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation> said it very well: When the energy and oil and gas sector does well, Canadians and all of Canada do well. This is a debate that should not be divisive, but should bring parliamentarians and Canadians together when we are speaking about how to ensure there are good-paying jobs going into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465488">I am going to take a different stance on how we are going to do this debate tonight, and talk about some of the innovations companies are doing to ensure the environmental sustainability and world-class environmental innovation that has gone on already without government intervention. If one can imagine it, energy companies in western Canada are already trying to do what we are trying to legislate. They are already trying to ensure they have minimal emissions. They are already trying to capture carbon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465489">An example was given on the CBC. I am pretty sure we know the CBC is not a big supporter of the Conservative movement across the country, but a CBC story talked about two companies that are already storing more carbon in the ground than they are emitting. The companies are Whitecap Resources and Enhance Energy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465490">Through carbon capture and storage and enhanced oil recovery, by burying CO2 and using it to enhance their oil recovery, reactivating wells that have not produced as much, and producing more barrels using their stored carbon, they have stored 4,000 tonnes of carbon underground, which is the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the roads in our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465491">Leave it to western Canadian entrepreneurship and innovation to already be ahead of government. I know that might come as a surprise to many members in this chamber, but many times the private sector is ahead of what the government has already tried to do. When we look at a Liberal government that continues to try to put roadblocks in front of our energy sector, whether it be Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> or the ever-increasing, burdensome, job-killing carbon tax, our people in western Canada, our energy sector and our men and women are working hard to continue to overcome these hurdles and be world leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465492">Today in this chamber I have heard people talking about the decline in oil demand. I did a quick search online, and oil demand is going to increase this year by 6% and next year by 3%. A global supply document said there will be an increase in demand until 2030 by a million barrels of oil a day. We are going to have to choose, not only in this chamber but as a country, whether we are going to be the ones who supply that oil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465493">Are we going to champion our oil sector around the world, and say that Canadian oil should be the increase in those supplies? Eighty-one per cent of oil is going to be shipped into Asian countries by 2050. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465494">I am here to say that should be Canadian oil. It should not be Venezuelan oil or Saudi Arabian oil. It should be Canadian oil, which is produced by the world's best innovative entrepreneurs, with the best environmental standards in the country and in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465495">I would also like to say that the way workers are treated plays an important role in how we look at our future. Workers are treated better in Canada than in other oil-producing jurisdictions. I and the MPs for <Affiliation DbId="252794" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="252944" Type="2">Regina—Wascana</Affiliation> had the opportunity to sit down and talk to USW 5890 workers over Christmas. It was a pretty tough time in Regina over the Christmas holidays. Almost 600 people were given layoff notices a week before Christmas. When we sat down and met with president Mike Day, one of the first things he told us was that everyone thinks Evraz is a steel company. He said it is not. It is an oil and gas company, because if there is no oil and gas sector, there is no steel plant in Regina. There is no co-op in Regina that has 2,300 Unifor employees making good wages. These are important things to talk about in these emergency debates, such as the one 11 months ago on Teck Frontier. We can use the numbers and talk about a billion dollars and a hundred billion litres of oil a year, but we are talking about people, their livelihoods and how they support their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465496"> I do not want to repeat myself, and I am sure everyone does not remember what I said 11 months ago, but it comes down to the fact that times are getting tougher for the hard-working men and women in our energy sector and they are looking for someone to support them. They have been abandoned by the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, the leader of the NDP. The hard-working energy workers have been abandoned by the federal NDP. It does not support building pipelines. Continuously, they have been tossed by the wayside by the Liberal government to fulfill an agenda that has “anti-oil” written all over it. We can see it in the legislation time and again, and in the fact that we are going to have to have another of these debates, at some point in time I am sure, on another cancellation of an energy project.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465510">However, after doing some reading, I learned that, last May, the Alberta Energy Regulator suspended a number of environmental monitoring requirements for oil sands companies. Of course, it is saying that it did that because of COVID-19, but one has to wonder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465511">The companies are no longer required to test groundwater and surface water unless contamination occurs that could spread to the environment. What is more, these companies no longer have to look for methane leaks, even though it is a major greenhouse gas, nor do they even have to monitor birds and wildlife. They are no longer obligated to monitor or conduct research on wetlands, since such activities have been suspended until further notice. Water escaping from storm ponds no longer needs to be tested, and major cuts have also been made to air quality programs. Are those really the best standards in the world?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465512">We also see that oil sands emissions have more than doubled since 2005 and more than quintupled since 1990, so there are four times more emissions.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6465515">Mr. Speaker, as I indicated earlier today, it is always a privilege to address the House of Commons, whether we are doing it virtually from our homes or on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465516">It has been interesting to listen to the debate thus far. I must admit that when this issue came up this afternoon in the form of a request for an emergency debate, I thought it would be a very healthy debate, given the importance of the issue. I applaud your decision, Mr. Speaker, to allow this emergency debate to take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465517">I have a few thoughts that I would like to share with members. Being from the Prairies, I do have a lot of opinions on commodities and our natural resources. I have recognized for many years how important commodities are. In fact, in the province of Manitoba, I have always articulated how wonderful it is to be rich in natural resources, relatively speaking. However, it is also critically important that we diversify our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465518">All in all, Manitoba has done a relatively good job of diversifying its economy. Maybe it does not get the same booms that some provinces, such as Alberta, have had previously, but we do not get a really strong bust, if I could put it that way. Through that diversity, Manitoba has managed quite well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465519">I do not want people to think of western Canada, in particular the prairie provinces, as a hinterland full of resources and that those resources have to be tapped into in order for us to move forward. In fact, we have good reason to believe that our prairie provinces will continue to grow and be prosperous. The natural resources and our commodities will no doubt play a critical role in the future development of our economy and society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465520">I do not question that whatsoever, and it is because of the people who make up our provinces and the diversification that is there today. It has increased significantly over the years. I am very proud of that. That is one of the reasons I was glad to hear about the establishment of a prairie diversification unit that would look at ways for us to continue to build upon that diversification, which is so critically important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465521">We hear a lot about energy workers and how important the energy sector is to Canada and our economy. There is no doubt that when we think of energy workers, we are not just talking about people in the province of Alberta. We need to recognize that we are talking about Canadians in virtually all regions of our country who are impacted by the Keystone decision of the current President of the United States. There is no doubt about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465522">Having said that, we also recognize that when the Alberta economy was doing well, the contributions to equalization over the years were immense, second to no other province on a per-capita basis and even far beyond it for a vast number of the provinces. Alberta has been a major contributor to equalization, ensuring that in many ways we can provide the types of social programming we have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465523">When we talk about the importance of natural resources, in particular our energy, we should focus on the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. We could also look out east to Newfoundland and Labrador, where we have high concentrations of the type of energy that I believe there is a world demand for. We need to recognize that fact. There is a need and that need is very real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465524">It is interesting to hear some members make comments in regard to the quality of products, our environmental standards and the manner in which companies in Canada treat our workers. I would argue they are far better and exceed many other oil-producing countries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465525">It is important to recognize that, from the beginning, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the cabinet have supported a process that would ultimately see Keystone move forward. I know that the Conservatives do not necessarily like that, but at the end of the day the government has supported that project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465526">It is interesting that what I have found over the years is that it depends on which party might be speaking. If it is a party such as the Conservatives on the right, they will criticize us for not doing enough and not building more pipelines. They ask why we care about the environment and say that we should just build those pipelines. This is an attitude that stems from the Conservative right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465527">Then we have my New Democrat friends. I suspect, possibly because of pressure from the Green Party, they have now abandoned, at the national level, the need for pipelines. The Green Party has said that pipelines are a no-go, and I think, because the Green Party has taken that position, a number of the New Democrat federal politicians feel somewhat uncomfortable. I say “federal” because it is important to realize that one of the staunchest advocates of additional pipelines was, in fact, the New Democratic Party in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465528">The New Democratic Party in Alberta played a critical role, not only in Keystone, but in other projects, and advocated for that development. The NDP at the national level has opposed Keystone and, no doubt, it has expressed, even in listening to the debate, some sort of victory. It is as if they are taking a victory lap because it appears that Keystone will not be moving forward because of the recent election south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465529">I would say to both my colleagues on the right, the Conservatives, and my colleagues on the left that when we think of development of our natural resources we have to realize that we can, in fact, be sensitive to our environment and to our resource development at the same time. We can listen to the stakeholders and work with provincial premiers and indigenous leaders and ultimately develop plans of action that will, in fact, benefit Canada as a society. That has been clearly demonstrated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465530">What I have found, when we enter into this type of debate, is that the Conservatives seem to want to stand on a pedestal, and that it does not matter what the reality is, but that they want to use it as some sort of a stand to be critical of the federal government and bash Ottawa. It does not matter what is actually taking place. All they care about is bashing Ottawa on this issue. They have consistently done that. It is one of the things where I would say there is some comparison between the Bloc and the Conservative Party. Earlier today, for example, I asked a Bloc member about recognizing that Alberta and its wonderful natural resource has provided a great deal to Canadian society in all regions, including to the province of Quebec, but they tend to close their eyes and not recognize the importance of this particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465531">I raised it by saying that it is much like we are concerned about our aerospace industry. Manitoba has a bit of an aerospace industry, and so does the province of Quebec, and other provinces do to a certain degree.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465532">When our aerospace industry has been in troubled times, the government has been there in tangible ways to ensure that we can work with the local governments to try to protect the industry. Likewise in regard to our oil industry or the energy industry as a whole, we recognize that there is a need for the federal government to be involved. In fact, Trans Mountain was the first pipeline to actually bring some of our natural resources to the Pacific Ocean coastline and the province of British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465533">Compare what this government has done with the previous administration. I have no problem making that comparison at any time. I would suggest that we have done more for the province of Alberta than Stephen Harper did when he was prime minister and the Conservatives were in power for 10 years. That is the reality. Listening to Conservative member after Conservative member speak on this, someone would think that the reality is the opposite, which is just not the case. The numbers clearly show that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465534"> Is there a Conservative speaker who could tell those following the debate how many miles of pipeline Stephen Harper built to the west coast? How many miles?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465535">
                <B>Mr. Garnett Genuis:</B> Four pipelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465536">
                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Colleagues will find that the answer to that is zero. That is the answer. It is not even an inch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465537">
                <B>Mr. John Barlow:</B> Not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465538">
                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what they might say about having gone over here, and then over there and getting some oil to the coast, they did not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465539">When it looked difficult for a pipeline to get to the Pacific, the federal government stepped up to the plate and acquired Trans Mountain, which the NDP premier supported, just like the NDP premier of British Columbia supported the LNG project. At the end of the day, when the NDP is in government, they tend to support Canadian interests. They tend to recognize the value of natural resources. It is only the federal NDP that seem to ignore that reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465540">My Conservative friends, on the other hand, are in the field of saying that it does not matter what the Liberals do. They have 30-plus MPs in Alberta and a Conservative premier. All they are going to do is to slam Ottawa. In Manitoba when I was an MLA, we called it “fed-bashing”. It is easy to blame Ottawa for problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465541">There is a lot of irony, I must say, in this. Think about it. The federal government took the initiative on Trans Mountain and spent several hundred million dollars to ensure that it went through. The Conservative premier of Alberta has spent hundreds of millions, going into the billions of dollars, on Keystone. Let us wait and see what happens there, but it is interesting how members of the Conservative opposition will criticize our actions on the Trans Mountain and say how bad we were to Albertans for doing it, but to what degree do they criticize Jason Kenney for his behaviour on Keystone? Some might suggest there is a bit of hypocrisy there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465542">As a government, in a relatively short period of time we have established a tangible process that gives certainty to the industry, a process that ensures there is indigenous involvement and consultations, a process that respects the environment. As a direct result, we are in a far greater position today to be able to see pipelines built and constructed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465543">Because of the actions we took years ago, we see thousands of jobs in Alberta and other jurisdictions that were created because of our initiatives. That is far greater than whatever Stephen Harper and the Conservatives did in their 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465544">We have to be very careful with criticisms. I spent 20 years in opposition and only a few years on the government benches, so I understand what members have to do in opposition to try to get attention. With the whole idea of national unity and saying the same thing whether in one region or another region, there is only one political entity in the House of Commons that is doing that and that is our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal Party. We recognize that as a federation, all of us benefit as a society when we support each other in the different regions. When the members try to bash Ottawa, such as the member for the New Democratic Party in saying that Ottawa has abandoned Alberta, I ask for an example. Tell me something that another provincial jurisdiction is getting that Alberta is not getting and show me it in a tangible way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465545">I always hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation> talking about how Ottawa has failed. I have a big problem with that because I am from the Prairies. I lived in Alberta. When I was in the military, I was in Alberta and spent years in Saskatchewan. I was born and raised in good part in Winnipeg. That is where I was for the last 30-plus years since I left the military. I am from the Prairies and will stand up for the Prairies, but I do not have to feed into the types of lines that separatists love to hear. I did not bash the feds when I was in opposition either. </ParaText>

Do the comparisons. Look at the numbers. Try to tell me that the Conservative government in 10 years invested more in infrastructure than the current government and current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It would not be true. We have invested more in the province of Alberta when it comes to infrastructure. When it comes to helping those who are in need in Alberta, when it comes to economic difficulties, we have stepped up and provided billions of dollars in support to Albertans, as we have done for all of the different regions.</ParaText>

Obviously we recognized, as NDP premiers and Conservatives did, the value of Keystone moving forward. With the election south of us, President Biden made a commitment, and from his point of view, he is fulfilling that commitment. It does not mean that the Government of Canada has reversed its position. We still understand the importance of this pipeline for all of Canada, not just Alberta. To that end, nothing has changed, but we will continue to work with the president in dealing with a wide spectrum of issues, particularly the issue of trade. We should think of the impact that also has on Canadians in all regions of our country.</ParaText>

I can tell the member directly that nobody is celebrating right now when workers are out of work in Alberta. What we are not talking enough about is the international embarrassment that is happening right now when other countries are making decisions to bring Canada in line because we are failing to do our part in tackling climate change, whether it be the U.S. on this decision or Norway with its sovereign wealth fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465559">Right now, we need to clean up is Jason Kenney's failed gamble, and to fix things we need to take real action on climate change. There are opportunity costs for us in pointing fingers like this. We need to get people back to work and invest in clean energy. Workers in Alberta right now want to hear that the federal government is going to step in and put people back to work with clean energy, jobs that are going to bring them into the future, and not another failed plan or another argument over failed pipelines. </ParaText>

Are Liberals going to take real action on climate change so that more countries are not taking action on Canada, because that is what we should expect if we do not take real action on issues related to climate change?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465570">This is an incredibly sombre debate to be entering into. It is one of those weeks that as an elected official we hope we never encounter. Let me describe that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465571"> Last Tuesday it was revealed, through a leak from the White House, that Keystone XL would be axed with the stroke of a pen by the new U.S. President. I started to hear from constituents. Canadians need to understand that about 1,000 of those layoffs that took place last Wednesday took place in Battle River—Crowfoot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465572">As I talked to pipefitters, welders, heavy equipment operators and labourers who worked directly on that pipeline, uncertainty ruled the day. In many cases, it was not just uncertainty in terms of their immediate future. The Keystone project had been a godsend for them after half a decade of uncertainty. Talking to those directly affected was heartbreaking, to say the least.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465573"> Then I talked to a single mom who, because of an uptick in the economic fortunes of the region, saw the ability to send her kids to piano lessons for the first time in a long time. Once again, that was called into question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465574">I talked to seniors who, in some cases, for the first time in years did not have to worry about whether to pay the power bill or put groceries in the fridge, because a Keystone XL employee was boarding in their house.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465575">Hotels that were empty, especially in an industry devastated by COVID, finally had people staying in them. Grocery stores, tire shops, small business owners saw there was once again a glimmer of hope in the midst of very challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465576">On a number of occasions I have talked about the energy industry, and will continue to boast about our world-class energy industry. However, I want to start my speech that way because this is not simply an issue of a pipeline. This is a very human issue that has a particular impact in my constituency where there is now literally 200 kilometres of pipe. For some context, the Alberta side of this project is entirely located within my constituency. The genesis of the pipeline is at Hardisty. It is an incredible place. I would invite members, especially those critical of the industry we are talking about today, to come to Hardisty, Alberta to see the world-class industry in action. That is where the pipeline starts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465577">It makes its way southeast through my constituency, near my hometown, where my family still farms, all the way to the Saskatchewan border, where it was meant to continue to the United States. There are massive human costs to the cancellation of this project, and I have outlined a few of those today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465578">I listened carefully to the debate. The Liberal member and parliamentary secretary talked about how he thought somehow we were playing politics with this issue. I hope I have started to humanize this very real issue and show how it is not politics; it is about the livelihood of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465579">Starting last May, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal government had the opportunity, knowing that there was an American election under way, to engage with American counterparts, putting politics aside, to stand up for what was in the best interests of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465580">I find it interesting that the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> and other Liberals today have somehow been making the case that this is what they have been doing. A phone call to the President admitting defeat does not count as standing up for an industry or standing up for those thousands of jobs that were lost last week. It is incredibly troubling. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465581">Over the last number of months, during an election in the United States, the transition that took place, leading up to the swearing in of the new administration this past week, the government should have been fighting for Canadians. I am not asking for anything special. I am acknowledging the fact that the Liberals failed to do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465582">The number of conversations I have had in this last week bring a heartbreaking reality to light. The government has failed. I have heard a lot of discussion today about the oil industry and how it is time to move on. In fact, a member from the Bloc said that this project was doomed to fail. Eleven months ago when we were debating the Teck Frontier project, which was also cancelled, we heard similar language. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465583">The environmental activists green left in the country, of which there are many in the Liberal Party unfortunately, are conflating the volatility of market investment with government policy that is systematically bent on destroying an industry, one of the legacy industries in my constituency. It is a national shame that this is the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465584">I can assure members that there is a business case for these projects: Teck Frontier, hundreds of millions dollars spent in the application process; hundreds of millions of dollars spent by TC Energy in the Keystone XL. Time and time again, other projects have been cancelled. Hundreds of millions of dollars were written off for energy east. That is not because a business case did not exist. That is because the Liberal government has made it impossible for that investment to succeed. It is a national tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465585">I want to talk about something that is very real. As I mentioned earlier, the previous Liberal speaker mentioned how somehow Conservatives from Alberta, from the west, were playing politics with the idea of separation. I am a proud Canadian through and through. What breaks my heart is that multi-generational Canadians come to me and they have given up on Canada. Many more say that they are ready to give up on Canada. That is the legacy of both the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his father. This should not be a political issue. It is the sad reality of the circumstances we face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465586">The actions of the government are sowing the seeds of division in the country, dividing different segments. It is not just east versus west although that is certainly one of the most flagrant examples. It is rural versus urban, north versus south, rich versus poor. The government has been incredibly effective at dividing Canadians, and that is a shame. It should be the first priority of any government to be a leader to unite for the best interests of all. Unfortunately, we have seen absolutely the opposite of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465587"> For those people who are now facing uncertainty in their personal lives, not sure how to pay the next rent, the next grocery bill, those who will not be able to get their kids in piano lessons, for those who have given up on Canada as a federation, I implore members opposite to take note of the seeds of division that have been sowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465588">When it comes to what needs to be done, we need a pipeline. I know my other colleagues have articulated very well the reasons for that, but we need a pipeline because it is what is best for Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465593">Here is the reality. There is a business case here because companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars investing in it. Currently we have a price differential in our oil that has caused Canadians to lose out on tens of billions of dollars of revenue that goes to fund the social services, which I know that member specifically is very passionate about. They want to play politics on this, yet the NDP, the Bloc Québécois and many Liberals fail to acknowledge that this pipeline is the best thing that could happen to the environment in our country. It would cut emissions significantly. Currently that oil is being sold by rail and through older pipeline infrastructure that will eventually have to be retired. This is an efficient way to ensure that a world-class product produced in Alberta, in Canada, gets to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465594">While the NDP and other green activist left parties want to play politics on this issue, the Conservatives are standing up for Alberta and our world-class energy sector.</ParaText>

I have heard from the Bloc all night about how somehow the national Government of Canada should be intruding in provincial jurisdiction. I find that ironic, and further, I find it ironic that the Bloc would be talking about election promises.

Quite frankly, the Liberals have done very little in terms of respecting their election promises and the laundry list of failures on that front, yet when it comes to standing up for a project, and against what is effectively an economic sanction against Canada on the first day of a new administration, the Liberals failed entirely to stand up for Canadian interests.

              <ParaText id="6465599">Mr. Speaker, this is a very difficult day. It is a dark day, not only for Albertans, but also, I hope, for members of Parliament across this country. Many of my colleagues have said today that when the information came out last Tuesday about the impending cancellation of Keystone XL, even though there had been a lot of hints that this would happen, it brought reality home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465600">I had a call on Friday from one of my constituents who is among the thousand workers who were laid off. I had another constituent whose company lost a contract, and it is costing him $100,000 a month. Do members know how many employees he is now having to lay off? I have had dozens of calls from constituents and their families about the devastating impact this decision is having on their families and communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465601">This is happening in the middle of a pandemic, which has already devastated every corner of our economy, and to add this on to that has been particularly difficult. When I answer those phone calls, the response from my constituents is this: Why is no one fighting for us? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465602">It is easy for colleagues from across the floor from other parties to say that, well, we are just going to transition to other jobs, and we are going to find them something else to do. What is that job? I have been hearing that from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for five years and we have 200,000 energy workers out of work in Alberta alone. None of them are coming to my office saying, “Thank goodness I have this job at a renewable resource industry”, because it does not exist without massive government subsidies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465603">We have talked about those thousand workers that TC Energy had to lay off on that first day, but this goes way beyond those thousand workers. Jack Mintz from the University of Calgary is predicting that there will be 3,000 direct jobs lost, and 14,000 indirect jobs will be lost in Alberta alone. That is not counting jobs in Saskatchewan, service company jobs or jobs in other industries that would have benefited from this pipeline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465604">Again, this is another hit to Albertans at the worse possible time, and they are asking why no one is standing up and fighting for them in this government. That is what they want. That is what they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465605">The impacts of losing this project are not just about Keystone XL. For many Albertans, and I would say, many Canadians, this is just the last straw of what has been a repeated attack on Alberta energy and Canada's economy. There is no question that when we come out of the COVID-19 pandemic, our country will already be on rocky financial footing. Much of that was because of out-of-control Liberal spending before the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465606">However, to come out of the pandemic and get Canada back on its financial feet, we are going to have to look at industries that we can rely on to be revenue generators. There are only a handful of those industries in Canada, and our energy sector is one of them. It is not just one of them, but the most important one, the one that creates the most jobs and the one that creates the most revenue for every level of government across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465607">Let us back up a little before we even talk about Keystone XL. Let us talk about the position that the Liberal government has put this country in when we talk about our energy industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465608">The second the Liberals got into power, they cancelled northern gateway. They drowned energy east in a flood of red tape and new regulations that no other infrastructure project had ever had to face before. They purchased the TMX pipeline, and my colleague, the parliament secretary, likes to think that they have put more money into the energy industry than Harper ever did. Harper never had to pay $4.5 billion for a pipeline that the private sector was going to build anyway. That $4.5 billion is now likely more than $12.5 billion, because every delay and every year that project does not continue with construction, it means product is not moving and it is not generating revenue. That $4.5-billion investment that the Liberals like to talk about is now a $12.5-billion white elephant on the backs of Canadians taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465609">We continue to cripple this industry with bad policy, such as Bill C-69, the no pipelines bill, the tanker ban and a carbon tax that will go to $170 a tonne, which is far beyond what any other country is putting on their economy, putting us further and further behind in terms of not being competitive. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465610">What has this virtue signalling gotten us? Has this earned us any social justice? Has this earned us any support from the activists? It has absolutely not. I wonder why we are trying, because they will never take yes for an answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465611">We already have the most stringent environmental and human rights standards in the world in Canada's energy sector. That is what we should be talking about, not phasing out our energy sector and not crippling it with bad policy just to try to appease someone else, who we know will never be appeased. Those goal posts will always move, and President Biden has proven that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465612">Let us look at Keystone specifically. Keystone had put more than $1 billion into renewable energy to power that pipeline, more than $1 billion to ensure that it was emissions neutral. That still was not good enough, so it is impossible to go any further. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465613">We have talked a lot about this being an Alberta issue, and there is no question that this has hit my Alberta and Saskatchewan colleagues hard. It is very frustrating to hear from colleagues from other parties that we should just get over it. However, this is not just an Alberta issue. This is a Canadian issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465614"> There are projects that have been decimated or cancelled, such as the Teck Frontier mine, which we have talked about. Warren Buffett has pulled $4 billion out of a Quebec LNG project in Saguenay, Quebec. There is the cancellation of energy east. The GE factory in Peterborough, Ontario, was going to expand, and that expansion was cancelled. There were 350 workers laid off in Peterborough. That plant was making turbines for pipelines. Therefore, this is not just an Alberta issue. This is a Canadian issue. This is about our economic and energy sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465615">What is at stake next? This cancellation of Keystone and the lack of a fight from the Liberal government has emboldened these activists. Next in line is Line 5, which goes from Canada into Michigan. If that pipeline is cancelled by Enbridge, the Enbridge project, it could cost Sarnia 5,000 to 6,000 jobs and impact the jobs at Ontario oil refineries. Again, this is not just an Alberta problem. This is a Canadian problem, and I want my colleagues from other parties across Canada to understand that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465618">There has been lots of discussion that this is about climate change and fighting emissions. Members can bet it is. Keystone pipeline would have been a very important tool to addressing climate change and reducing emissions. Do members know who benefits from the cancellation of Keystone? I am going to look at these statistics. How about Mexico with $12.3 billion, Saudi Arabia with $11.5 billion, Iraq with $7 billion, Colombia with $6.5 billion, and Russia and Venezuela. I could go on. All of these countries are now going to be filling the void that is left by Keystone. What do members think the human rights and environmental standards are of Russia, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia compared to those in Canada? </ParaText>

Forty-eight per cent of the total amount of crude that gets imported into the United States comes from Canada. We exported 3.7 million barrels per day, every day, in 2019. Ninety-eight per cent of Canada's crude exports go to the United States. There is no problem exporting crude to the United States: 79% of our imports are from the United States, so we are trading oil back and forth.</ParaText>

Without building more infrastructure, there are no more jobs in the oil patch. This is a sunset industry, and when we see the big money, the smart money, not investing in oil and gas in Canada and the United States, we see governments, and provincial governments in the case of Alberta and British Columbia, throwing taxpayer dollars down a swirling drain to keep projects going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465622">We have international agreements. Stephen Harper signed an agreement in 2009 in Copenhagen to reduce emissions by 17% over 2005 levels.

Two provinces increased their emissions so much that we levelled right out, and they were Alberta and Saskatchewan.</ParaText>

The technology and innovation in Canada is second to none. When it comes to reducing emissions and addressing climate change, Canada is not the problem. Canadian energy is not the problem.

With Keystone specifically, TC Energy had promised that every single one of the jobs in the United States would be unionized labour, so the NDP should be supporting these types of things. If she indeed wants to fight for jobs, why is the NDP not supporting something like this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465634">I will reiterate what I said before. If the member's fight is to reduce emissions for climate change, Keystone was the epitome of what we should be doing.

              <ParaText id="6465644">As I was mentioning, this is an important industry to our country. It is our largest industry. It is our number one export. As parliamentarians, we cannot get around the fact, and we should not be afraid of the fact, that Canada is the fourth-largest producer of oil and gas in the world. As a parliamentarian, I was disappointed in the decision the Biden government made, in part because of the impact it is going to have on the workers and their families. Members of Parliament in the House tonight have spoken about that, in part because this project was already started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465645">I would say that this was about creating regulatory certainty, whether it is in the United States, Canada or anywhere in the world. If companies are going through those processes, we need to be able to move those forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465646">As was already articulated by my colleagues, this is not just an issue for Alberta and Saskatchewan. This is an issue from every end of the country. As the member of Parliament for Kings—Hants, I have many constituents who have had their start, built their livelihood and worked in these sectors. They either still transition between western Canada and the Maritime provinces or have made their start, come back home, and used their trade and the skill set they learned to contribute to our economy in Nova Scotia, pay their mortgage and make their living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465647">Sometimes I hear too much of the narrative from members of Parliament that this is a regional issue. No, this is important to workers and families across the country. Indeed, the impact of this industry has important benefits, paying for public services from Vancouver Island to Newfoundland. I want to make sure that is on the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465648">It is important to note that despite the fact that this is a setback and the fact that the Biden administration has not approved Keystone, the relationship remains important. As I understand it, about $100 billion of energy exports cross our national borders every year. This relationship that we have with the United States will remain important. Right now, 23% of the crude consumed in the United States comes from Canada. We certainly play an important role in energy security for North American markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465649">I had the chance to tune in at different times tonight before I had the floor, and the narrative became that the government has “failed” to drive this project forward. Often it is members from the opposition ranks who like to suggest that government fails on issues that sometimes are completely outside the control of the Government of Canada. Of course, world oil prices are not dictated by the Government of Canada. I remember with Teck Frontier that some of the conversation there was around the future of the oil and gas industry. There was a lot of narrative that the government was not doing enough to support it, but of course we do not control world oil prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465650">In terms of what we could do to work with the United States, our ambassador has been on this, as has the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, from day one, in terms of engaging on this issue. If members do not want to believe me, the Premier of Alberta, Jason Kenney, as early as last week, talked about his support for the work that was going on behind the scenes to advance this project. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465651">At the end of the day, the United States is a sovereign country. We have a strong relationship and the Government of Canada can do its utmost, as we have, but we do not control those decisions being made outside our national borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465652">The suggestion that is being made is that we should retaliate, that we should create a trade war of sorts, not unlike what we saw from the last American administration, a trade war with what is both our closest economic partner, because of its proximity and its market to Canada, and also one of our most important partners from a security perspective. I do not think the suggestion that we should retaliate brings any benefit to oil and gas workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or anywhere in this country. That could only jeopardize the existing relationship of that $100 billion that goes back and forth every year and is crucial to our supply chain in North America.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465653">I want to touch on a point the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> made. I have to be fair and make sure I am balanced in my remarks tonight, because I thought the member for Foothills spoke quite eloquently. I thought he was convincing on many points, but he talked about appeasing social activists almost as though the government is moving in a direction just to appease a small group of individuals who might be very prominent on environmental issues. The member for <Affiliation DbId="253026" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, or perhaps it was someone else, might have spoken about the fact that global financial markets are focused on investing in industries and companies that are moving in this direction. In fact, Canadian energy companies understand this. They are moving in this direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465654">On the suggestion that this is appeasing social activists, we have international agreements to be able to move on this. This is not about appeasing social activists; this is about recognizing we have work to do in the international community. Energy companies know that they have a social responsibility to get there. I think there is a way to balance both, and I will get to that in a moment, but I found that comment to be a bit unfortunate in what was otherwise a quite good speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465655">There is a lot of finger pointing, but we also have to compare and contrast to the last government as well, a Conservative government under Stephen Harper, our former prime minister. In terms of the legacy the Conservatives left behind, they were not able to advance the projects we have been able to advance, and I will go through some of them in a moment, but there is a lot of blame being sent toward our current government that fails to recognize the existing record that they had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465656">One Progressive Conservative former prime minister, Mr. Joe Clark, who actually was briefly the member of Parliament in Kings—Hants in the early 2000s, said, “One of the real problems that I think lingers over [Keystone] is, before the pipeline question arose, the [Harper government] deliberately went out of its way to be seen as an adversary of environmentalists.” That is perhaps similar to the comment made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252554" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> today, and for Mr. Clark it was problematic. That is the type of Progressive Conservative thinking we need to see more of in our opposition party, which is about balancing environmental interests along with economic ones. That is certainly what our government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465657">To talk about our record, we approved TMX and bought it when it was necessary, and we are building it. It has created over 7,000 jobs. We have approved NOVA Gas, and a thousand more jobs will be created in Alberta. Line 3 has been approved, which is another 7,000 jobs created. As well, $1.7 billion has been provided to the western provinces to help with abandoned and inactive wells, which is helping reduce emissions and keep oil and gas workers on the job. Closer to my end of the country, in Atlantic Canada there has been $320 million to support workers and lower emissions in Newfoundland's offshore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465658">I wish I had more time to go on, but my point is that it is similar to when we talked about Teck Frontier. We have certain members of Parliament in this House who do not believe our oil and gas sector plays a prominent role in the days ahead and we have members of Parliament who fail to recognize that we also have to move on our environmental record. Those two can co-exist. Our government is the one to make that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465659">We will work in the days ahead with industry, as they are already doing, to make sure they are sustainable and that there is a future for this important sector in our country.</ParaText>

This fourth time, however, I am sure that my colleague from Kings—Hants will answer me because he will have understood the question, especially if he has been following the debate since the beginning. What I want to know is not complicated, and I hope that the government, or at least one of its members, will answer me.</ParaText>

In honour of that I am wearing my Oliphant tartan tie. It is a minor nod to the heritage that some of us share in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465680">It is a great privilege to participate in tonight's debate, which has been very wide-ranging. This debate is about a pipeline and the decision by a democratically elected President of the United States of America to cancel a long-hoped-for pipeline that was to take Canadian energy to our neighbours to the south. However, it is much more than that. It is about Canadians, mostly Albertans but not only Albertans, who are worried about their livelihoods with the cancellation of this pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465681">It is about Canadians across the country who are worried about how they will fit into an economy that is undergoing a fundamental transition regarding the way we live, the way we work and the way we engage together, and it is dramatically changing our economic and industrial landscape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465682">It is also about Canadians who are wrestling with the reality of climate change, of threats to air quality and the health impacts of environmental degradation. Mostly, it is about how we hold all three of these things together at the same time, protecting livelihoods in the short term, ensuring economic transitions in a fair and just way and ensuring that no one is left behind, and how we do these things while taking real and concrete steps to address climate change and improve the quality of life in Canada and around the world for the benefit of everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465683">As we wrestle with these three things simultaneously, we also recognize very clearly that Canada is not an island. We share this continent and, maybe more to the point, we share an economic, cultural and deeply important energy and environmental relationship with the United States. It is second to none in the way it impacts all of us. That relationship is something that all Canadians are now coming to grips with. We are each other's top energy supplier across virtually every source of energy: oil, gas and hydroelectricity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465684">We are also the United States' number one partner in energy security, ensuring our industries and consumers have a supply of power to sustain jobs and communities. That energy security also demands environmental sustainability as a key component. The Canadian government and Canadian industry are committed to the ongoing process of increasing the sustainability of our energy supply, and together we are taking action to drive down the environmental footprints of traditional energies, developing and deploying clean energies, and increasing energy efficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465685">As we move into a clean-energy transition and toward a decarbonized economy that will address the challenges of the changing climate, our bilateral energy and climate change collaboration becomes even more important. That is because climate change is, at its core, an issue that requires collective action. We are committed to that work. This applies to the energy sources we use today, the ones we invent tomorrow, and our policies to fight climate change in the weeks, months and years to come. Every energy projection indicates that over the next few decades we will continue to need fossil fuels as that transition continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465686">Today, I bought a new car. It is kind of fun to pick up a new vehicle. It is my second hybrid: a Toyota made in Woodstock, Ontario. It will use gasoline, but it will use less gasoline than a car with a conventional engine. It is a symbol of the transition that we are in, moving to new technologies while continuing to be dependent on fossil fuels. Many of us find ourselves in that same place. In Canada and in the United States, we are in that together. Today, Canada is by far the best source for the United States for that fuel because of many factors, including our geographic proximity and world-leading energy production practices. We are good producers of some of the world's best sources of energy, and I think we all share, in the House, the goal of producing the oil and gas we will continue to need for some time in as sustainable a way as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465687">Canada's environmental, social and governance record for oil production ranks third in the world, well ahead of any other supplier to the United States, which itself ranks sixth. Is this good enough? Not good enough for us, but it is an excellent record and can only get better. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465688">Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance, for example, which represents all the major oil sands companies, is developing new technologies and sharing best practices to enable a further reduction of the impact of their in situ operations on freshwater resources. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465689">Canada is also a leader in clean tech and reducing the environmental footprint of fossil fuel production. Just today, two Calgary companies, Enhance Energy and Whitecap Resources, announced they had gone beyond net zero to achieve net negative production of oil. This remarkable accomplishment was achieved by capturing carbon which was then itself used to extract the oil. This means that the companies are storing more emissions underground than they are producing in their operations. This is the kind of innovation that will accelerate our transition towards a green future, which underpins our climate commitments as a country. The world is watching and taking note. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465690">It is in that context that I, for one, very much welcome the renewed commitment to climate change that we saw in the election campaign of the Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and in the early signals coming from President Biden in his new administration, such as rejoining the Paris Agreement and implementing a build back better green recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465691">Canada is committed and determined to work closely with the United States as we move forward addressing climate change. There is no greater problem in our world than climate change. We will not always agree, and from time to time there will be bumps in the road with the United States, but our two countries will show the world that we are serious about the existential crisis that is climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465692">On December 11, our government announced an initial $15 billion investment as part of its plan to accelerate the fight against climate change so that Canada can exceed its 2030 Paris Agreement targets and reach the government's additional commitment of net-zero emissions by 2050. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has already raised climate change with the president in both of his telephone calls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465693">We are all in this debate together and though we are not all in agreement, we do agree that climate change is an existential crisis that needs to be dealt with. At the same time, we also recognize that people continue to need jobs and that we need to continue to have fossil fuels for the way we live in this country as we transition to a new economy and a new way of life. Together we can ensure our economies so that our children and our grandchildren live in safety as we recover from COVID, and that we will benefit from a complete mix of energy sources that reduce emissions and enhance North American energy security, combatting climate change and making this climate livable for generations to come.</ParaText>

The investment climate in Canada is driving investments in resource-based companies to countries with weaker environmental standards and poor human rights records, which should be motivation enough to see a project like this through to completion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465720">It is important at this time to consider what Canadians are saying about Canadian-sourced oil and gas. It might surprise some of my colleagues from different parties to learn that there are opinion polls consistently showing that even Quebeckers have a strong preference for getting oil supplied from western Canada rather than other countries. In a poll done by the Montreal Economic Institute, it found that 71% of Quebeckers would prefer to import oil from western Canada than from other countries. It also found that 50% of Quebeckers believe the province should develop its own oil resources instead of continuing to import all the oil it consumes. </ParaText>

This pipeline represents an opportunity for reconciliation and prosperity. Chief Alvin Francis from the Nekaneet First Nation in my riding is the president and CEO of a first nations group called Natural Law Energy, which, as some probably know, had a significant investment in an equity agreement with Keystone XL. When I talked to Chief Francis about the news that the permit was being revoked for Keystone XL, he was quite saddened and disheartened about it because this project had meant funding and the opportunity to further education and housing, and advance the economic development that they have been working so hard to build for their people. </ParaText>

He said that they are extremely disappointed by the short-sightedness of this U.S. administration and that this should be treated as an attack on fair trade within our countries. He continued that, at a time when our economies are suffering, we should be supporting industries that will create thousands of jobs and millions in taxation revenue. He feels that this project not only represents our economic interests, in the short term and the long term, but is also a sign of the relationship with our largest trading partner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465727">What does the government have to say to the Nekaneet First Nation, to Shaunavon and to the countless communities and workers it is letting down? Before last week, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told us about one phone call, and at committee we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">natural resources minister</Affiliation> and also from the <Affiliation DbId="253799" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> that they had one phone call back in November with the incoming American administration.

              <ParaText id="6465728">If it is a priority, one half-hearted phone call does not add up to a priority. If it is a priority, the Prime Minister, the natural resources minister, the <Affiliation DbId="271244" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253399" Type="4">international trade minister</Affiliation> would have all been at the table repeatedly asking the former and incoming administrations to ensure that this project is built.

              <ParaText id="6465729">There are oil and gas companies that have made the claim that they are net negative in their emissions because of the utilization of carbon capture and storage.

              <ParaText id="6465732">The Liberals knew the position of the incoming administration. Did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> think that one phone call back in November and then one phone call at the eleventh hour, politely expressing disappointment, was going to be enough? Obviously, we all knew what the goals of the Biden administration were. We knew what it was saying. It laid it on the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465733">The point I am trying to make tonight, and that all my colleagues are trying to make, is that if the government truly does care about Canadian jobs, if it truly cares about Canadian resources, about our oil and gas sector, about the workers who it repeatedly talks about, it would have put in a wholehearted effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465734"> It was great to hear the government talk about consultations with the Alberta energy minister and even with the Saskatchewan energy minister. That is great, but honestly that is just preaching to the choir. That is not really the audience it needs to speak to. The government needed to be speaking, as I said earlier, with the incoming administration and the now new President of the United States and his people about the importance of this project, what it was going to bring to Canada and what it was going to mean to the energy security for North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465735">Several great opportunities have been proposed and promoted over the last five years. The Liberal government effectively killed them with its death by delay tactics. Quite frankly, it has allowed it to blame everyone else for its dithering and delaying on all these kinds of projects. We saw that with the Teck Frontier mine and we see once again with Keystone XL. A lot more is at stake each and every time the government uses this tactic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465748">Mr. Speaker, on his first day in office, U.S. President Joe Biden cancelled the expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that is critical to Canada's economic interests, and pushed 1,000 people into unemployment immediately. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> responded by waving a white flag. He got so tough that he declared how much he was looking forward to working with the new President on their mutual goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465749">The government has told Canadians the President is keeping his campaign promise and that we ought to move on. It is easy to say if one is a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>who recently shut down Parliament and spent most of his time at his home and cottage while hard-working Canadians went to work and others were being put out of their jobs. What the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is really telling hard-working Canadians in the oil and gas sector, and the industries that support it, is that they ought to move on from the much-needed jobs that support their livelihoods. They ought to move on from making sure they can put food on the table and provide for themselves and their children. That Albertans ought to move on from an industry that gets us to work, keeps our houses warm when it is -20°C outside, and supplies all of the plastics in the PPE that has been so valuable during this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465750">Here are the facts. Canadians are being asked to move on from a thousand direct construction jobs, an anticipated 2,800 directly related projects with jobs that could be available in Alberta, a $1 billion equity investment in Keystone XL by Natural Law Energy, which represents five first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan, $1.1 billion of Government of Alberta investment, and manufacturing jobs in Ontario and elsewhere that support oil and gas development, not to mention all of the potential jobs and internships for newly graduated students. Recently, when I was doing Zoom meetings with a lot of students, that was what they were worried about: that there would be no more jobs or internships. This is a direct attack on those students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465751">Must I remind the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that Canada is in the middle of the greatest public health crisis and economic shock this country has seen in many decades? The government squandered an opportunity to bolster economic development during a time when Canadians most desperately need it and instead is looking for the great reset, none of which is appealing to Albertans or most Canadians. Many businesses in Alberta and throughout the country have closed because of the pandemic. The vacancies of office space in downtown Calgary are staggering. Families are struggling to scrape by and people's mental health has been greatly affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465752">Through the Keystone XL expansion, we had an opportunity to encourage significant job growth and investment. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has abandoned Canadians. While he is more than willing to turn his back on hard-working Canadians and an industry that much of the world envies, the Conservatives will always put Canadians first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465753">Canadians are tired of a Liberal government that continues to pander to radicals while shaming our own oil and gas sector in the process. The Canadian oil and gas industry is a product of inspiring ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit. It is an industry we have every right to be proud of, which is why I found the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s response to the President's decision puzzling and weak. We heard about the Prime Minister calling the President and expressing disappointment. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465755">Our people and companies are incredible innovators. I recently visited a company that has developed a system that monitors pipelines in real time and transmits information about events instantly. This shows the innovation we are seeing in this industry. While oil production has gone up, our emissions intensity has decreased in a very significant way. To a growing world that needs reliable energy, that is an important fact. Since 2000, Canada's oil sands emissions intensity is down by 20%. Emission levels from new projects are near or better than the average levels of emissions from American crude.</ParaText>

The Obama government punted the project around like a political football for years and years. Mr. Obama's State Department approved it twice, but he waited until the Liberal government was sworn in and then rejected the application, with very little objection from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465761">It has become clear to many of us that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government are looking to cover up their real agenda: the destruction of the Canadian resource economy. Nothing in the last five years of the government has Albertans convinced that the Liberals have our economic best interests at heart. They vetoed the northern gateway pipeline. Energy east was shot down by ever-changing and burdensome regulations. They have stood idly by while Keystone XL was vetoed twice. Antienergy legislation like Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> banned exports off the northwest coast, and Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> altered the regulatory process to such a degree that it was labelled the “no-more-pipelines act”. The government botched the Trans Mountain expansion to such a degree that it nationalized it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465762">Numerous other taxes and delays are just more pileup on the government's failed policies. Unfortunately, other parties represented in the House have cheered on every delay and veto, no matter how much it hurt their fellow Canadians. This is having a very negative effect on our Confederation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465763">Albertans are not willing to move on. That is why it has not been a surprise to westerners that all the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could muster was an expression of disappointment over the phone, not much else. With the government's track record, the cancellation of a crucial pipeline seems par for the course. However, let me remind the Prime Minister that first and foremost, he is Canada's Prime Minister. He has a responsibility to stand up for Canadian workers and their families. We call on the Prime Minister to show that he has not turned his back on Canadians and assertively re-engage the president to make sure the Keystone XL expansion resumes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465768">We are still hearing that Canada's production of oil and gas is somehow green or environmental. It is not. It contributes more greenhouse gases than almost any other form of oil, except for heavy crude, which we know is produced elsewhere in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465769">In Canada, since we produce more oil than we use, we are exporting product. If we want to continue to use Canadian oil while we transition quite rapidly off of fossil fuels, we could do that and give ourselves a timeline so that oil workers and others in the industry have the time to transfer their excellent skills to a renewable sector, to clean tech and green tech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465770">The fallacy here, somehow, is that if we do not sell other people our oil, they will get oil from worse places. The world is transitioning off fossil fuels. We have to do our part, and pipelines are not part of the moral obligation to do our part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465771">Does the hon. member agree that we should begin to diversify our economy and move away fossil fuels as quickly as possible?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465775">We have a prime minister who continually downplays the oil and gas industry, does not look to support it, but says that he has their backs. He continues to talk about jobs. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> basically said that they would be able to get their jobs.

              <ParaText id="6465777">Mr. Speaker, when it comes to jobs, I heard a lot in today's debate, especially from NDP members, about the government needing to create these jobs. I do not fully agree with that. In a perfect socialist world, where they like to dwell, they want the government to control everything. We want to see less government regulation. We want government to get out of the way so jobs are created by job creators. We need to unleash them and their potential rather than putting burdens on them with regulations such as Bill C-69, Bill C-48 and the doubling up on carbon taxes, which are instant job killers. We have seen that over and over again. The Conservatives want people to carry on with that entrepreneurial spirit. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465786">The public record will plainly show that this government has supported Keystone XL since taking office in 2015, not just through public engagement but also through submissions in the regulatory process. It was one of the first issues that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> raised during his congratulatory call to President Joe Biden in November. We have continued to press our case with the incoming administration's top officials since then.

              <ParaText id="6465791">I believe that the energy sector must and will play a vital role in this recovery. Despite the challenges of the past year, the sector remains a powerful national economic engine. Not to oversimplify it, but the late Jim Prentice, a good friend to many of us in the House, used to say that energy is our family business. It is something that we are really good at and because we are good at it and because our petroleum industry innovations have led to extraordinary wealth, we have been able as a nation to fund schools, hospitals and much more infrastructure, generating jobs in rural communities and advancing indigenous reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465792">Right now, this part of our economy is struggling. People and communities are hurting through no fault of their own. The oil sector has been particularly hard hit by the double shock of an oil price war and a pandemic that has strained global demand through most of 2020. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465793">Our support has included an injection of billions of dollars in much-needed liquidity. We brought in a 75% wage subsidy that has helped support as many as 60,000 energy sector jobs in Alberta. We injected some $2.8 billion directly into the oil and gas sector to create and protect jobs while also strengthening the industry's environmental performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465794">I know that some of my colleagues have expanded on these programs this evening, but I want to focus on something else. One year ago, the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> delivered back-to-back speeches that highlighted Canada's changing economic reality. They were delivered a few weeks before the pandemic turned our world upside down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465795">In his first speech in Vancouver, he spoke at the Globe 2020 and CleanTech conference, the largest gathering of its kind in North America. He told the clean-tech enthusiasts something that maybe some of them were surprised to hear. He said there was no way we could get to net-zero emissions without our oil and gas industry, its ingenuity and resources and the wherewithal it provides to fund and support the necessary breakthrough solutions to get us to net zero.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465796">The next day in Calgary, he delivered opening remarks while co-hosting an innovation summit with his Alberta counterpart, energy minister Sonya Savage. In the heart of Canada's oil patch, he told an audience of petroleum industry executives that there was no future for them that did not include getting to net zero.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465797">These messages are two sides of the same coin. It is the same two-sided coin that applies to all of Canada's industries, not just energy, but mining and forestry, manufacturing, transportation and every other part of our economy. As Canada's executives, including those in the oil patch, recognize that, investors from around the world are making clearer choices.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465799">This recognition crosses party and jurisdictional lines. It was just last October that Premier Jason Kenney told his party faithful that Alberta could no longer stick its head in the ground or pretend that the aspirations behind the Paris Agreement were not hugely influential in how capital is allocated and how market access decisions are made. There is a growing consensus that we have to follow this global trend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465800">Fortunately, Canada is ideally positioned to get there and to lead the way. Energy is one of our greatest strengths. We have been blessed with a diversity of energy assets that make us the envy of the world. We are the world's fourth-largest producer of oil and sixth-largest producer of gas. These companies have, for years, been the largest source of green tech investment in Canada, pouring money into research to reduce their own emissions and emission intensity, while also diversifying into low- or non-carbon sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465801">Along with this asset, Canada is third in the world for hydroelectricity, a leader in everything from solar and wind power to biofuels, one of only five Tier 1 nations for nuclear energy, a front-runner in clean hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, a supplier of choice for minerals critical for powering a clean-energy future, and a global powerhouse in smart grid storage technology and carbon capture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465802">All of these world-class energy assets combine to give us a natural advantage during this energy transition to power our cities, heat our homes, transport our citizens and produce tomorrow's goods and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465803">The question is, how do we do all of these things and keep growing our economy while producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions? That is the challenge and the opportunity of our post-COVID recovery. First and foremost, it is the right thing to do in the face of an urgent climate crisis, but also it is the surest way to strengthen our economic competitiveness, attract new investments and create good, sustainable jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465804">We recognize the frustration of the industry and the provincial government, and we are saddened by these job losses. We will do everything we can to support the workers and communities impacted by this.

              <ParaText id="6465805"> Together, our two great nations can help revive the global economy. We can confront and defeat this pandemic. We can build a clean energy future that leaves no one behind.</ParaText>

Conservatives also believe in a strong energy sector and in addressing environmental challenges at the same time. The problem is that the rhetoric just does not sync with the government's actions. The Liberals have killed multiple pipeline projects on Canadian soil. They passed Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> and they passed Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, which prevent projects from going forward. We had the Teck Frontier project, a project that would have been carbon neutral by 2050, yet was killed through active lobbying against it by various people in the Liberal caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465808">On the one hand, Liberals profess to understand the important role that the energy sector is going to play going forward, but if we look at the reality of their record on energy, on pipelines, on Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, on Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, on Teck Frontier and so many other projects, it is clear that they are talking out of both sides of their mouths on this.</ParaText>

There are many, many projects that we have invested in to support jobs in Alberta and in Saskatchewan, and we will continue to do so.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465826">Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary talked a lot about getting to net zero, which I applaud. I hope we all agree that is something that we really have to do, but I would like to remind him that the Canada energy regulator's report before Christmas pointed out that if we do even a moderate amount of work to meet our Paris targets to fight climate change, and this does not include getting to net zero as they did not go that far, we would only need one of these three big pipeline expansion projects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465827">Since Line 3 is scheduled to come on later this year, that means Keystone XL would not be needed. That means the Trans Mountain expansion would not be needed. We would not need any more oil-by-rail expansion. I am a bit confused as to why his minister said this was an existential threat to the Canadian economy, or something along those lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465828">This is an opportunity for us to go to the United States and, instead of pleading with Joe Biden to get permission for this pipeline, to negotiate with the United States about getting involved with their very bold plans to fight climate change and benefit Canadian industries across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465830">Let me go back to what we announced in December for clean tech. I believe what we have already committed to as a government could certainly benefit Alberta and Saskatchewan. There are some synergies and opportunities on the U.S. side regarding hydrogen, geothermal and clean electricity. There are a lot of commonalties that could support great-paying jobs in Alberta and Saskatchewan, so we need to focus on the opportunities that exist. However, let me again remind the member of market forces: If there is a need for oil and gas, the markets will decide.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252779" Type="2">Mr. Francis Drouin (Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6465831">Mr. Speaker, our government has focused night and day on the need for a vibrant economic recovery from the pandemic that leaves no one behind. That is why we were both disappointed and saddened with President Biden's decision to revoke the Keystone XL project's permit the day he was inaugurated: disappointed that our efforts in frequently working shoulder to shoulder with the Government of Alberta did not succeed, and saddened for the thousands of workers being laid off. This will hurt many Canadian communities, including indigenous communities. We will continue to work on their behalf to ensure they are part of Canada's recovery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465832">I must shift now to a key point in the debate. It needs to be said that the Keystone XL project has been a priority for our government since we took office five years ago. It was among the top issues the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> raised in his first conversation with then President-elect Biden right after the U.S. election. We kept pushing our position with high-level officials in the new administration leading up to January 20.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465833">That underscores this government's determination to support the people and communities in the sector as we strive toward our Paris climate targets. There is no contradiction in these dual goals, because we recognize the ingenuity of our petroleum sector and its status as Canada's largest green tech investor. Put simply, these companies are playing a vital role in helping us find the breakthroughs that will help us confront the climate crisis. That is why the industry and the individuals and communities depending on it figured so prominently in our government's unprecedented COVID-19 economic response plan, which included an injection of billions of dollars in much-needed liquidity for the industry and the introduction of a 75% wage subsidy that has helped to support as many as 60,000 oil and gas jobs in Alberta. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465834">Canadians saw this support when we announced two key components of the COVID-19 package last April.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465835">First, we earmarked more than $1.7 billion to clean up orphan and inactive oil and gas wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. It is not just an investment aimed at improving the environmental performance of the oil patch; it is also creating thousands of jobs when and where they are needed most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465836">Second, we created a new $750-million fund to reduce the industry's greenhouse gases and in particular methane emissions, which can be over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide. This new emissions reduction funding includes $75 million specifically set aside for the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore industry, and we have already bolstered that investment with another $320 million to support upgrades to existing offshore infrastructure, environmental services and clean technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465837">This is how we build the most sustainable oil and gas sector in the world. It is by working with an industry that is, as I noted earlier, a leader in finding innovative ways to reduce its carbon footprint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465838">Petroleum companies routinely account for more than 70% of all private sector investments in R and D, or more than $1 billion each and every year. The Government of Canada is certainly part of that push. It is why the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> announced $100 million in new federal funding to support the clean resource innovation network. This is an industry-led initiative of more than 1,300 members, all devoted to improving the oil and gas sector's environmental and economic performance by developing the breakthrough solutions that drive economic growth, create good well-paying jobs and lead to cleaner energy production. It is a classic win-win and one aimed at reducing the sector's greenhouse gas emissions by 100 megatonnes by 2033, or the equivalent of taking 1.5 million cars off the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465839">This perspective has also informed and inspired our government's ongoing efforts to support a strong and sustainable petroleum industry and make it a supplier of choice not only in the United States, but around the world. Just last month, for example, we announced federal approval of the NOVA Gas system expansion project in Alberta. It is a $2.3-billion initiative that will create close to 3,000 jobs, while advancing stronger indigenous engagement and oversight, accelerating the phase-out of coal-fired electricity and providing stronger protections for local caribou herds and their habitat. These are many of the same things that went into our extensive consultations for the Trans Mountain project and our eventual decision to purchase that project in 2018.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="50">(2350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6465840">We did not just rescue a critical piece of energy infrastructure; we also helped put more than 5,000 Canadians to work in building vital access to tidewater, as well as opening new opportunities for our energy exports and advancing indigenous partnerships and reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465841">Another key pillar is the world-class environmental protections we have put in place alongside the TMX project. Those pillars include the $1.5-billion oceans protection plan that stacks up well with what other leading marine nations are doing to preserve their coastlines, oceans and marine life. If I may add a quick aside, I would remind Canadians that we have committed to investing every dollar earned from the TMX project to accelerate Canada's clean-energy transition. That is huge. We have estimated that once the TMX project is completed, it will generate an estimated $500 million in additional corporate income tax revenues alone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465842">I also want to point out to members this government's support for the $40-billion LNG Canada project in B.C. It happens to be the single largest private sector investment in Canadian history, and it is a project that will be one of the cleanest LNG facilities of its kind anywhere, emitting half the GHG emissions of similar facilities around the world—half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465843">That is why our government was on the ground with $275 million in federal investments for critical local infrastructure technology to support the LNG Canada facility, ensuring that a generational project and up to 10,000 jobs become reality. These types of projects remind us that Canada is not only a place where good projects get built; we are also critical to securing North America's place as the most dynamic, influential and well-regulated energy region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465844">As important as all of these things are, I have to point out that the pandemic has exposed another pressing priority. COVID-19 has laid bare global vulnerabilities and inequalities. The job losses we have seen during this pandemic have been disproportionately borne by women, youth and indigenous people, as well as marginalized groups such as immigrants, racialized people and persons with disabilities, all of which has reinforced our belief that a clean-energy future cannot and must not leave anyone behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465845">This brings me back to Keystone XL. This was an excellent project. We fought hard to make it happen. However, we have to respect the democratic institution of our number one ally and trading partner. President Biden made a promise, and he kept it. We must now look to the future and work closely with this new administration on our many shared objectives, from global health to climate change to job creation. We will work with that administration and all Canadians to deliver on our shared mission: net zero emissions by 2050, a global economy that continues to grow and an energy transition that leaves no one behind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465846">Mr. Speaker, I can hardly believe what is coming out of the hon. member's mouth. He says that the Liberals rescued TMX. What did they rescue TMX from, exactly? It was from their own government's abysmal policies. It was his government's imposition of the carbon tax, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> and all the regulatory uncertainty that scared away the investment. They act as if it is something to be proud of. For the first time in Canadian history, the government had to buy a pipeline in order to get it built. That is a damning indictment of the government's record when it comes to the energy sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465847">Why are the Liberal Party and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> so quick to make apologies for the U.S. president? We should not be surprised. They could not stand up to Donald Trump during NAFTA and now they cannot stand up to President Biden on Keystone. They are making apologies for the fact that on day one, the U.S. president signed the executive order to kill Keystone XL, which hurts employment in both Canada and the U.S. It hurts indigenous opportunities, as well as opportunities for everyone else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465848">They are so quick to apologize. Why is it that the government has such a hard time standing up to American presidents? It drove away investment; it drove jobs and opportunity to the United States; it backed down on NAFTA under President Trump, and now it caves like a bad hand in poker before even trying. Why is the government constantly backing down from American presidents?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6465852">Mr. Speaker, the member clearly articulated how the Liberals have been pushing for betting on these pipelines. He said there is no contradiction with climate action, but Canada's own independent energy regulator says that the oil sands will not need Keystone XL or the Trans Mountain expansion if the government passes the promised climate legislation. Oil and gas workers are struggling. Fifty thousand workers have lost their jobs since 2014, but instead of implementing the kind of just transition that would support workers, families and communities with training and low-carbon jobs for the future, the Liberals keep making empty promises on the climate and cheerleading, or buying risky pipeline projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6465853">If the Liberal Party or the Conservative Party truly cared about communities and workers across Canada, would they not be investing in a just transition, not sometime down the road, but now to diversify our economy and create low-carbon jobs?</ParaText>
