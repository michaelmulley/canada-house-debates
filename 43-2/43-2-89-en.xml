He deserves all of the credit for his work on this particular bill. He is the longest-serving Conservative member on the industry committee. I would like to thank him for his incredible and tireless work at that committee and for his contributions to this important study and the report that we are debating on that study today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653301">Today we are addressing “The Investment Canada Act: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitating Canada's Recovery”. With the economic calamity brought on by the government's mismanagement of the COVID crisis and with its mismanagement of spending regulations and taxes, the Investment Canada Act came to the forefront of debate one year ago and still resonates, as this piece of legislation gives the federal government the power to review foreign investments in Canada under two broad criteria: national security and the net benefit review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653302">Foreign direct investment reviews are critical in areas that are sensitive to national security, but they can be absolutely necessary, as it is important to protect industries that are linked to the security of the nation. With the growing phenomenon of rare earth and other minerals and resources that not only furnish us with our quality of life, but protect our security and our sovereignty, it is important to ensure we do not surrender these resources to hostile foreign powers. They include “natural resources, food and medical supply lines, infrastructure (telecommunications and transportation), media and culture, the health sector, the hotel industry (given the need to protect personal information), as well as some emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information processing, and semiconductors.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653303">It is clear these sectors should have the ability to operate in a way that allows for competition and customer choice, however it is equally important that they not become the successful target of hostile foreign powers that seek to acquire them not for any market-driven purpose, but rather to threaten the security and sovereignty of our nation. That is why this report is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653304">To that end, I will cede the rest of my time to the real expert on this subject, the member who has done more work than anyone on it, and that is the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252797" Type="2">Red Deer—Mountain View</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653305">Madam Speaker, I must say I am a little disappointed in the Conservatives, but not surprised. Yet again they are moving a motion to prevent the government from being able to debate the very important issues before the House. I can understand there are certain aspects the opposition does not want to debate, for example, the legislation on net zero, which was one of the scheduled pieces of legislation for some discussion. After all, their position seems to be flip-flopping on the price of pollution. Today, I think, they are in favour of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653306">Does the member recognize the importance of allowing the government to be able to deal with absolutely critical legislation at this time of year? Why do the Conservatives continue to want to frustrate the government's legislative agenda, when they themselves will ask why the government is not passing enough legislation?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653307">Madam Speaker, let me start by pointing out the obvious fact that everyone in the House recognizes: no one wastes more time in Parliament than that member. No one is, in fact, more capable of compressing so many words into so little substance as him. Indeed, I have had constituents say that they wish they could hit a fast-forward button when he stands up in the House. Perhaps the legislative agenda of the government would move more quickly if he would say a little bit less and do a little bit more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653308">I am also very sorry that the member does not want to discuss the protection of the sovereignty of our industries that are crucial to our national security. Maybe he just wants to sell all of our critical strategic industries to Communist China, which his leader admires for its basic dictatorship. We Conservatives actually think that Parliament should be discussing how we protect our strategic industries against hostile foreign takeover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653309">Finally, if the member is so concerned about moving Parliament along he should talk to his <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about why he shut the place down for two months straight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653310">That is how I would respond to his never-ending complaining about the opposition's use of Parliament to debate critical issues that affect the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653312"> I am very concerned. Basic questions were asked. In his role as CFO, what financial information was requested by the Government of Canada in its decision to order the CSSG? His answer, “I do not know.” What assurance did WE give the government that it could handle the financial load? “I do not know.” That was their CFO. Mr. Li's signature is on the service contract. Why was the contract retroactive to May 5? He does not know. What assurances was he given on May 5 onward that expenses would be covered? He does not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653313">I would like to ask my hon. colleague about this. This is $500 million-plus that we were going to give to the Kielburger brothers. They just walked in, signed this deal, and yet their CFO cannot answer basic questions about due diligence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653314">Madam Speaker, the member asked some very good questions. He is absolutely right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653315"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> personally intervened to award a half-billion-dollar contribution to a group that had paid his family a half-million dollars, yet Mr. Li, supposedly the chief financial officer of the WE Charity, does not have the most basic information about this half-billion-dollar grant that he would have presumably been administering as the CFO. This particular individual has gone missing for roughly a year now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653316">When I originally asked for him to testify at the finance committee on the WE scandal, he wrote back saying he was too sick, so apparently he is still too sick to testify. We asked him to answer questions in writing and his answer is that he does not know anything about anything. I guess he is taking a page out of the ministerial playbook where the government has sent ministers to the committee whose top answer to the most important WE scandal questions has been, “I don't know”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653317">Madam Speaker, it is indeed an honour for me to speak to this motion this morning. I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> for recognizing the number of years I have been associated with the industry committee, and I am honoured to present some of the findings in this particular report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653318">Few things are as important to my constituents and to all Canadians as how the government supports workers, families and businesses in these unprecedented times, and few things are as important as ensuring a strong and prosperous recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653319">Canada's Conservatives have worked tirelessly over the last year to address and fix many of the shortcomings of the ill-designed and flawed assistance programs introduced by the Liberal government. We stood up for Canadian workers who tragically lost their jobs due to the Liberal government's slow and inadequate response to the pandemic. We stood up for businesses that have struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic and will continue to do so over the coming months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653320">This is part of what the report from the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is all about. The report's recommendations will help to ensure that Canadian businesses remain drivers of economic growth for all Canadian workers. They will help to ensure that our most important intellectual assets stay in Canadian hands. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653321">Over the last year, many countries around the world have taken concrete measures to prevent the predatory acquisition of businesses within their borders by actors connected with authoritarian regimes or by state-owned enterprises. The countries that have acted are pro-investment countries, such as Australia, India, Germany and those of the European Union. They recognize that times of great economic difficulties for businesses leaves them vulnerable to predatory takeovers or acquisitions, which can jeopardize ownership of intellectual property and put jobs at risk. Canadian businesses are equally vulnerable, which is what the standing committee heard in testimony from many expert witnesses, but like everything else, the response from the Liberal government has been totally inadequate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653322">Shortly before the standing committee began its study, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service highlighted the risks posed by foreign takeovers in today's environment in a report. An article explains:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The agency said that while most foreign investors are not hostile, those [investments] from state-owned enterprises and firms with close ties to governments or intelligence services need to be weighed very carefully.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653325">The Liberal government's response to these very real concerns was to introduce a weak-kneed, vague policy statement last April that suggests the minister could request additional information or extend the timelines for the review of acquisitions under the Investment Canada Act's national security provisions. Last month, and in response to the standing committee's report, the Liberal government issued equally weak updated guidelines on the national security review of investments, which suggest, for example, that investments by state-owned or state-influenced investors will be subject to enhanced scrutiny regardless of the investment value. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653326">As hon. members know, there currently is no investment value threshold for the review of acquisitions under the ICA's national security review provisions. Such reviews are conducted entirely at the discretion of the minister and with no requirements for consultations with security experts such as CSIS. Rather than strengthening the Investment Canada Act itself, the Liberal government's response to protecting Canadian interests in the current pandemic has been to engage in more smoke-and-mirrors excuses that accomplish nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653327">Over the course of its study on strengthening the ICA, the standing committee heard testimony from several expert witnesses about the need to act decisively. For example, the committee heard testimony from Dr. Christopher Balding of Fulbright University in Vietnam. He said that Chinese state-owned enterprises in particular target assets, whether in natural resources or technology, that are prioritized by political leaders rather than by market forces. How did the Liberal government respond? It responded by issuing vague and meaningless guidelines and policy directives. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6653328">During testimony at committee, Dr. Charles Burton from the Macdonald-Laurier Institute stated that Canada should consider a complete moratorium on all investments from authoritarian regime state-owned enterprises pending the establishment of clearer criteria for these types of investments. Dr. Burton also noted that we need more awareness of where Canadian interests lie and more clarity on the idea of net benefit under the Investment Canada Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653329">Dr. Burton also said, “I'd like to see a more open and transparent process that would give us more awareness of the basis for government decision-making.... The Canadian people should be more aware of what's going on and how our government is responding to it.” How did the Liberal government respond? It responded by issuing weak closed-door guidelines and policy directives without any consultation at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653330">During its review, the standing committee also heard testimony from Jim Balsillie, chair of the Council of Canadian Innovators. Mr. Balsillie noted that the Investment Canada Act is a critical regulatory tool for ensuring Canada's prosperity and security, but he also noted that it does not reflect the contemporary economy, where the most valuable national, economic and security assets are intellectual property and data. He suggests that Canada needs to go beyond reviewing acquisitions by SOEs of authoritarian countries because, if the assets are critical to Canada's prosperity, security and sovereignty, then we need to ensure they remain in our control, regardless of the foreign counterparty. How did the government respond? Quite simply, it did not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653331">The recommendations in the standing committee report are balanced, appropriate and timely. They are based on the testimony we heard from experts about the need to protect our interests while also continuing to attract foreign investment to Canada. In line with the testimony we heard, the standing committee report recommends reducing the threshold under the ICA's net benefit test to zero dollars from the current level of $428 million if the acquiring entity is a state-owned enterprise and that all thresholds be reviewed on an annual basis. It recommends that the government should take steps to improve the treatment of intangible assets under the net benefit review process of the ICA, and it also recommends that the government should implement legal measures necessary to block any transaction that would undermine Canada's national security by transferring a sensitive asset to a non-Canadian entity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653332">The report recommends that the Government of Canada take steps to protect our strategic economic sectors, such as natural resources, agri-food and the pharmaceutical industry. The committee also recommends that the Government of Canada immediately introduce legislation amending the Investment Canada Act to compel the minister to consult with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Communications Security Establishment in the national security process. Strangely enough, there is currently no provision or firm requirements within the act to do that, leaving everything up to the political discretion of the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, and we all know the government's track record on that front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653333">There is no question that foreign investment helps drive economic growth and creates jobs. Interestingly enough, while pro-investment countries such as Ireland saw foreign investment double between 2015 and 2019, foreign investment actually shrunk by half a percentage point over the same period under the Liberal government in Canada. Conservatives have always understood the benefits of foreign investment and have taken steps to promote more. That does not mean that we should abandon any notion of protecting Canadian interests, as the Liberal government seems so intent on doing. It means that we need to remain open, but also vigilant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653334">I therefore urge all hon. members to support the motion before us today so that we can move forward to strengthen and modernize the Investment Canada Act to reflect both our present realities, as well as the 21st century economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653336">We have also seen the Liberal government approve a transfer of senior homes in British Columbia to a Chinese state organization called Anbang, and that was a horrible mistake by the government. When members, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="253096" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation> and I, raised it, the government said it is all up to the provincial government. We cannot allow the government to continue to approve such large-scale transactions and effectively say we should let the provinces figure it out. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653338">Madam Speaker, there are two aspects to what the member has asked, and the first is how are companies and businesses in Canada are supposed to be able to compete when they see investment dollars coming into our country from state-owned enterprises? That is really the critical aspect of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653339">There are so many businesses that are just kind of get their footing underneath them, and then they start to have this extra competition. That is really a critical aspect of it. We have seen it in the health care system. I know the European Union was extremely concerned about what was happening there. That is why it took action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653340">The other aspect is that the government is pushing all the difficult decisions on the provincial government. We have talked about how the pandemic, vaccines and all the issues have been downloaded to provincial governments. I think it is something we need to be cautious and aware of.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653344">One of the key considerations is to look at what is actually happening, and not having some arbitrary number that triggers the review. When we are talking about national security, this is one of the main parts. Quite frankly, although the Liberals suggested it does not matter, the testimony we heard indicated that CSIS and national security folks would actually have the right to access and look at all of these acquisition potentials, so that is really an important aspect.</ParaText>

It has had many other opportunities to be able to raise it. Why raise it today, when we have other legislation we want to debate? Why does the Conservative Party continue to want to frustrate the government's House business?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653346">Madam Speaker, usually when anybody gets up to speak, the member has a question of process. I go back to what the member for <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> indicated, which is that the current government does not seem overly serious about passing any particular government legislation. It spent two months hiding from Canadians this summer under prorogation. We continue to see its members adding more and more types of legislation that really do not advance the betterment of this country, as we are trying so hard right now to look at the economy and make sure Canadians are going to do better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653347">Madam Speaker, it truly is amazing when we stop and think about it. In the last number of months, we have seen the official opposition, the Conservative Party, continue to behave in an irresponsible manner and play a very destructive role in the House of Commons. Even in the question that I just finished posing to the member, he tried to give the impression that the government is not passing legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653348">The Government of Canada has been very much focused on Canadians and the pandemic, and bringing forward legislation that is going to have the backs of Canadians in terms of supporting them, whether it is legislation like Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> or the budget we just voted on yesterday. That has been the priority for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653349">There are other important issues that the Government of Canada has been trying to get through the House of Commons. For example, today we have legislation on net-zero emissions. That is something that is important to our environment. I realize that the Conservative Party, as a group, has said that the environment is not an issue. However, recently we had the Conservative leader saying that the price on pollution is a positive thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653350">Conservatives do not want to debate the important issues that need to be debated and that Canadians want to see leadership on. The Government of Canada is prepared to provide that leadership. The official opposition, I believe, will be found in need and lacking in its performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653351">The issue within the report today is important. There is no doubt about that. There are lots of reports out there that are important, but it is time that we see the official opposition recognize what Canadians want us to recognize, which is the important issues of the day that the House of Commons needs to deal with, and stop playing the destructive force it has been playing for the last number of months. I believe there is a need for us to get back to an agenda that deals with the issues for Canadians.</ParaText>

However, I digress. It has been able to do many of the things that this bill purportedly says it would do.

We now see that the Conservatives have suddenly come to the conclusion that it is necessary, most likely because they realize that public opinion is on the side of pricing pollution.</ParaText>

I found it somewhat ironic that the Conservative Party, in the pamphlet it put out in the past few weeks, endorsed the carbon tax and the clean fuel standard, both of which it has attacked this government on, day by day. Unfortunately, the plan it has put forward is very weak. It will make very limited progress and I think Canadians understand they cannot trust the Conservative Party—</ParaText>

At that time, we gave the suggestion that perhaps there needed to be industry representation to make sure that critical industry voice was heard. What did the minister do? He promoted people who have said things on social media like, “At Davos we will tell world leaders to abandon the fossil fuel economy.” Another one stated, “[Canada] must demonstrate how a major fossil fuels producer and exporter can transition away from these pollutants”. He did the exact opposite.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6653490">Mr. Speaker, it is rather disappointing to see the government bring in time allocation to restrict, or even muzzle, parliamentarians in their debate on a very important bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653491">The environment is very important. I have said this many times and I cannot stress it enough. I want all Liberals and everyone to understand that our party, the Conservative Party of Canada, recognizes climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653492">Our <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> presented an environment plan last week. I am not sure if that is what provoked the Liberals, but I want to point out that in the week following the presentation of our plan the Liberals changed their greenhouse gas reduction target three times. On Sunday, April 18, they were at 30%. In the budget presented on Monday, April 19, they were at 36%. On Thursday, April 22, in a bid to impress the rest of the world, that figure went up to 45%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653493">Canada's greenhouse gas emissions will go down in 2021, but I assure Canadians that this will have nothing to do with the Liberals. The current health crisis has indeed caused a worldwide reduction in greenhouse gases, and I hope that the Liberals will not take credit for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653494">The Liberals have been in power for six years and, unfortunately, nothing has been done. From 2015 to 2021, greenhouse gas emissions increased by 5% under this government, which had a majority for four years and is now in minority in its second term, which will last who knows how long. That is a fact. Nevertheless, the Liberals have the audacity to tell us to keep quiet about this important subject. That is a big problem for me because there has to be respect for the institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653495">Let me get back to the bill “respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050”. This bill fundamentally has merit because it seeks to protect the environment for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653496">However, I, and many others in Canada, think that the Liberals have a hidden agenda. There are five parts to the bill summary, and one very important one is both troubling and worrisome. In the interests of transparency, something that the Conservatives really value, unlike the Liberals, I want to share a quote from the bill. The bill:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653502">As I said at the outset, the liberal government has a hidden agenda. Based on what we know right now about its membership, the government has appointed—or pre-appointed, if I may be so bold—people to the advisory body. However, the bill has yet to be accepted. The selection of members is therefore a concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653503">I am giving the second part of my speech today. In the first part, I mentioned that we do recognize climate change and that all Canadians must work together if we want to get results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653504">Canada has a wealth of natural resources in oil and hydrocarbons. Not a single person from this industry has been appointed to the advisory body.

              <ParaText id="6653511">We agree that the principle of Bill C-12 on climate accountability is a step in the right direction. In fact, Jack Layton introduced a bill along those lines in 2006. However, there is a lot missing from Bill C-12. The government wants to conduct assessments and produce reports every five years, but, for the Liberals, “in five years” means 2030. The year 2025 does not exist. We do not know why the Liberals are putting this off for practically a decade.</ParaText>

I remember the Liberal government saying in 2018 that we needed to take action and that it was urgent we do so. Yes, it is urgent that we take action. However, as I already mentioned in the House, under Bill C-12, there will have been two majority governments and one year of a minority government before we begin to see results. That is ridiculous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653535">Madam Speaker, it is always an honour and privilege to be a strong voice for the hard-working people of Mississauga East—Cooksville. I know first-hand just how devastating the impacts of climate change can be on their lives. My riding in the city of Mississauga has had to deal with some of the worst flash flooding in the country. Extreme weather events that used to happen every 40 years are now happening every six years. Canadian cities are facing two crises as they converge in a perfect storm, the combination of a rapid rise in extreme weather events, as a result of climate change, with growing deficits in sewer and storm-water infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653536">On that note, I want to thank our government for the millions of infrastructure dollars in assistance it has provided Mississauga to help mitigate future flood damage. Per year, there are now 20 more days of rain in Canada. That is up 12% since 1950. In 2012, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that replacement costs for Canada's sewer and storm-water infrastructure would be almost $55 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653537">In Mississauga, we are seeing floods. Across Canada, we are seeing more intense fires, floods, droughts, heat waves and hurricanes tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, and having increasingly dire impacts on our public health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653538">I say all this to make it crystal clear that climate change is the greatest long-term threat that we face as a community, both locally and globally. It is also our greatest economic opportunity. Members may ask how great it is, and it is a massive $2.6-trillion opportunity. By taking bold climate action, we will create new jobs for the future, strengthen our economy and grow the middle class, while also ensuring clean air and water for our kids and grandkids.</ParaText>

Going forward, Canada will continue to work closely with the United States and other countries to reach our ambitious climate goals, creating growth and improving the well-being of all people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653541">Members may ask how we will achieve all that. It is spelled out through our government's ambitious Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act. The question will be posed, and it is a great question. Let me explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653542">Let us look at some of this government's most recent investments. Since October 2020, we have invested $53.6 billion to establish Canada's green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, create jobs and secure a cleaner future for everyone. On top of that, budget 2021, which was announced last week, also builds on that approach, including through a new investment in Canada's net-zero accelerator that will incentivize Canadian businesses and industry to develop net-zero technologies and build our clean industrial advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653543">Budget 2021 also includes new measures to make life more affordable and communities more livable by helping more than 200,000 Canadians make their homes greener and working toward conserving 30% of Canada's lands and oceans by 2030. These new measures will help Canada exceed its Paris climate targets, reduce pollution and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653544">Since 2015, we have been committed to finding real solutions to help tackle the climate crisis while also creating jobs, strengthening our economy and growing the middle class and those working hard to join it. We have put a rising price on pollution that puts money back into the pockets of Canadians, made new investments in public transit and banned harmful single-use plastics to protect our oceans. Together, we will continue to take action in fighting against climate change and secure a better future for Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6653565">Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to debate the federal government’s climate ambitions and the Liberal Party’s commitments in Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653566">We are in quite a predicament. On the one hand, the Liberals want to accelerate the debate because they have just realized that they did not give Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> enough priority in their parliamentary calendar. On the other hand, the Conservatives have tabled a motion in amendment seeking, not to modify Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, but to draw the debate out and have “the House decline to give second reading to Bill C-12”. That is something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653567">It is ironic that the motion to amend asks the government to “implement a plan that recognizes climate change is real”, when the Conservative Party does not even recognize climate change exists. I would like to remind members that, at their convention a few weeks ago, 54% of Conservative members rejected a motion to recognize the existence of climate change. Regardless of what the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">party leader</Affiliation> said to try to rectify the situation, the members were clear and, as a result, the environmental plan they tabled a few days later has no credibility at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653568">The Conservatives want the government to fight climate change “while also ensuring that economic development and job growth can flourish all across Canada”. We understand that that is the Conservatives’ greatest fear; for them, a green shift means an economy in tatters. Just last week, a Conservative member moved a motion asking that the government recognize that “replacing oil and gas with more environmentally sustainable options is not technologically or economically feasible”. That is rich. Not only is it excessive to ask the government to do something like that, it is also irresponsible to make such a statement unequivocally. I fear that people will be misled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653569">Quebec is living proof that polluting fuels can be replaced by clean energy and that the green shift is good for the economy. Quebec is a champion for green energy and the reason Canada enjoys an enviable position on the world stage. We have an advantage over the 50 U.S. states and the other Canadian provinces thanks to these investments, and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> said as much recently. The green technologies developed in Quebec are already being marketed outside the country, and the benefits for Quebeckers are significant. For example, Hydro-Québec has signed agreements with New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653570">There is much to reproach the government for, but it has understood one thing: we need to move forward with the development of green energy, because it is good for the planet and for the economy. We need to stop thinking about the environment and the economy as mutually exclusive, because they are actually complementary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653571">The Conservatives' amendment also tries to make the government admit that the members it appointed to the advisory group provided for in the bill included “climate activists whose influence, if acted upon, would lead to the destruction of the oil and gas sector, disproportionally threaten certain regions of the country and their essential industries, and weaken national unity.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653572">Once again, that is quite a statement. Of course, we are not surprised that the Conservative Party is defending the oil and gas sectors. Equally unsurprisingly, climate and environmental policy experts say that these two sectors are harmful to the environment. We cannot bury our heads in the sand. It would be surprising if the experts said that in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we need to continue investing heavily in the oil and gas industry. That would be very surprising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653573">I expect that the experts are well aware that this industry is the Achilles heel of the government's climate ambitions, and that they are also aware that supporting the industry is not viable in the short, medium or long term if we want to meet our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653574">The government is certainly being ambitious with its targets, but it is becoming difficult to follow. Since the Liberal Party came to power, its greenhouse gas emission reduction target has been 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, which was the same target established by the Paris Agreement and Stephen Harper's government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653575">The climate plan presented last December proposed to exceed this target. With the increase in the federal carbon tax, we could now expect a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The target in last Monday's budget was a 36% reduction by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. This new target was soon superseded when, on the margins of the climate summit hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden last Thursday, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada announced a new target, or rather a range of targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653576">Apparently, the target is now at least 40%, the minimum target that countries had to commit to in order to participate in the summit, but it could reach 45% if all goes well. The problem is that the $17.6 billion in green investments set out in the budget will allow us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 36%, not 40% or 45%.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6653577">Normand Mousseau, a physics professor at the Université de Montréal, says that if all of the greenhouse gas reduction measures work, in the best-case scenario, we would see a 23% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653578">In an interview on Friday, he said that based on what is happening in other countries, a carbon tax alone is not enough to meet our targets. We need to create new standards or new regulations to decarbonize certain industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653579">The federal government announced several billion dollars in investments, but the amounts are not aligned with the recently announced greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653580">We believe that this 40% or 45% reduction is more hot air than a real commitment. We believe that a real commitment would be ending support to the oil and gas industries. We believe that a real commitment would be announcing that we will never again finance a pipeline. We believe that a real commitment would start by incorporating the new target, whatever it is, into Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which has not yet been done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653581">As the bill now reads, the minister must set a target for each milestone year, and the targets will be set one at a time, five years before the beginning of the milestone year to which they relate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653582">The problem is that the government refuses to include 2025 as a milestone year, because it is too soon or, more likely, because it would be unable to meet the target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653583">That means the first milestone year in Bill C-12 is 2030, and the target is a reduction of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions. I find it odd that the government is setting such a high bar for 2030 without establishing a means of measuring its progress before 2030, since that is the very purpose of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653584">During question period last week, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> if the new Liberal target would be included in Bill C-12. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252965" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>, who appears to be acting as the new minister of the environment, answered that yes, it would be included.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653585">Before I get too excited, I wonder whether the actual Minister of the Environment endorses this commitment and whether he will propose an amendment to his bill to fulfill it. I sincerely hope so, because it is ridiculous to have a climate act without a greenhouse gas reduction target. It is also ridiculous to say that the minister will set the target once the act is in effect, and it is still more ridiculous to say that he can change the targets as he goes along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653586">Bill C-12 must show Canadians that Canada is truly meeting its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. The act must be transparent and include a real accountability and reporting mechanism, because we are talking about climate accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653587">Seeing the Prime Minister make a commitment on the international stage is encouraging. It seems promising, and it is cute to do it on Earth Day. However, we must not forget that Canada has never succeeded in meeting any of the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets it has set over the years. Kyoto, Copenhagen, Paris: the Government of Canada has failed lamentably each time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653588">Moreover, Canada is at the bottom of the class. It is the only G7 country where greenhouse gas emissions have increased since 2015. Why? Because it is an oil-producing country and it is incapable of stopping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653589">All this makes me think of the concept of “doublethink” from George Orwell's <I>1984</I>. I am not saying that this government and the regime in Orwell's novel are anything alike, but the Liberals' environmental discourse is a perfect example of doublethink. According to Orwell, doublethink is the ability to hold two conflicting opinions simultaneously by suspending critical thinking. In Orwell's words, doublethink means “to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653590">In my opinion, that perfectly describes the Liberals' strategy when it comes to climate change. The Liberals know they have to act, so they talk about a green recovery, the electrification of transportation and bioforestry. At the same time, however, they continue to subsidize the oil and gas industry heavily. They spend billions to buy an oil pipeline and even allow companies to drill for oil without environmental assessments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653591">The unbelievable thing is that they are convinced that they are doing the right thing, precisely because they are applying doublethink to climate change. The Liberals know that they are contradicting themselves, but they still believe in the virtue of these two diametrically opposed visions. They are not fooling anyone. Most of us actually have more confidence in Joe Biden, the new U.S. President, whose intentions are clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653592">President Biden has announced that the United States will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030. Remember, the U.S. is also an oil-producing country. In fact, it produces more oil than Canada and has a larger population, but its target is more ambitious than ours. This is not a competition, but at least the United States has started working harder, and it even had to pressure Canada to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653593">I sincerely hope that the Liberal government hears this message and that it is serious about its ambitions and commitments, because we are in a climate crisis. Time is running out.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6653610">Madam Speaker, today, I am speaking to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act and to some of the bill's flaws, not least of which is the vital role our oil and gas sector plays and the role it will play in getting us to net zero.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653611">When the Liberals first introduced the bill to the House back in November 2020, they introduced it primarily as a political wedge. I want to be clear that although we are opposed to this legislation, the Conservatives do support the aspirations of reaching net zero by 2050. We proposed an amendment to the legislation to recognize the importance of the role of oil and gas in reaching net zero. This position is also consistent with the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="253374" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>'s comments. Without this amendment, I cannot support the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653612">The reality is that the Conservatives want to reduce our emissions, as most Canadians do, and we join Canadians in the goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Where we differ from the Liberals is how we get there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653613"> While the Liberals are content to raise taxes on Canadians, making everything like home heating, groceries and driving to work more expensive, the Conservatives believe there is a better way, one that does not penalize the average Canadian, the very people the Liberals are claiming to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653614">The Conservatives are the party of conservation. We want to conserve low tax rates for future generations, we want to conserve economic opportunity and we want to conserve our environment. These are all elements of our plan to secure the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653615"> When I talk about conserving the environment, I mean that on a number of fronts. The overarching goal of this legislation is to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and balancing carbon emissions from industry is at the forefront.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653616">However, another aspect less talked about is the environmental conservation of our national parks and protected lands that, when properly taken care of, also help us in lowering emissions by acting as carbon sinks. The leading cause of emissions coming from our national parks is forest fires. Unfortunately, forest fires devastate large areas of land far too often and when fires erupt, they exponentially emit carbon as the fire grows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653617">One thing that contributes to the large size of forest fires when they occur in the western part of the country is the infestation of mountain pine beetles. These beetles are an invasive species that destroy thousands of pine trees every year. When these trees die, they naturally emit carbon and the dried brush from standing or fallen trees will rapidly burn in the event of a forest fire. Mountain pine beetles are causing great damage along the eastern slopes of the rockies and the government must take action to control this invasive species and save our pine trees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653618"> With investments in forest fire management and technology to extinguish these fires when they do occur, we can help curb emissions from forest fires and protect our parks. My riding of Yellowhead is home to Jasper National Park, one of the largest and most beautiful parks in Canada. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653619"> There is often a misconception that the Conservatives do not care about the environment when, in fact, that is not the case at all. My riding, by percentage, in the last election was one of the most Conservative in the country, and voters were interested in our plan for the environment. The narrative that the Conservatives do not care about the environment must change, because it is simply false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653620">Recently I visited Enhance Energy's carbon sequestration wells in Clive, Alberta, and was beyond impressed with the emerging technology it was using to safely sequester carbon. This one company alone has sequestered enough carbon in its wells that is equivalent to the carbon emissions saved by every electric car on the road in Canada today. Any of my colleagues who are listening and are intrigued by this, post-COVID, I encourage them to visit and see the carbon sequestration wells in person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653621">This technology has huge benefits and is very exciting. This Alberta homegrown innovation will change the world in how we safely sequester emissions and store carbon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653622"> The path forward to achieving net-zero by 2050 will not be an easy one, but with the political will, innovative science and smart investments, it is a worthy goal we can achieve.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6653623">My riding has business owners, environmental stewards, farmers, oil and gas, and other natural resource workers. It does not matter what line of work they are in, even the vast majority of resource-sector workers I meet deeply care about the environment, because they know that sustainability is important. As we transition to a greener economy, these workers must not be left behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653624">I recently have noticed a change in the Liberals' messaging on our oil and gas sector. The throwaway line that they used when talking about oil and gas, and to justify the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline, was that the economy and environment went hand in hand. Now they are not even using that line. Instead, they are avoiding talking about the economic benefits of our natural resource sector altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653625"> As exemplified in our new Conservative plan to secure the environment, the Conservatives know that the economy and environment go hand in hand, which is why our plan is to cut emissions without cutting jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653626">My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Edmonton Manning</Affiliation>, recently put forward his Motion No. 61, which I am proud to jointly second and support. I mention this, because I believe my position on both Motion No. 61, a motion calling on the House to support oil and gas, and Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act, are intertwined. If we achieve net zero by 2050 by simply transferring our emissions to other countries, potentially adding to world-wide emissions, commonly known as carbon leakage, destroying our economy in the process, what have we really accomplished? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653627">Canadian oil is extracted with the highest environmental and labour standards in the world. If we phase-out our oil and gas industry but continue to import oil from other countries with lower environmental and labour standards, we are hurting both our economy and the environment. It just does not make sense. Instead, we need to champion our oil and gas industry and recognize the vital role it plays within our economy now and the vital role it will continue to play into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653628"> Fooling Canadians by offloading our emissions to other countries through carbon leakage is a serious concern for the Conservatives. Addressing it is an important element of our plan to safeguard the environment. As we work toward net zero by 2050, we must remain conscience of not only the goal of reaching net zero, but cutting the 1.6% of global emissions for which we are responsible. The Conservative plan to introduce carbon-border tariffs aims to stop carbon leakage and ensures we are truly cutting our emissions and not transferring them elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653629">When I read Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document>, I read the word “accountability” eight times within the bill. However, for a bill that talks so much so much about accountability, it lacks it. The bill would ensure the accountability for future governments, but what about the current government? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653630">The Liberals have failed to meet their 2020 targets by 123 million tonnes. The aspirations of the bill to achieve net zero is clear, but the Liberal plan is not working. The Auditor General's report revealed that the Liberal's carbon tax was in fact not revenue neutral, and the federal government collected $225 million more than it paid out in carbon tax rebates. Under the Liberals, we see higher taxes and higher emissions. We need an environmental plan that works for Canadians, a plan that puts more money back in their pockets, while reducing emissions, and a plan that creates jobs in emerging sectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653631">While I agree with the aspirations of the bill to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, I cannot vote in favour of it without recognizing the importance that our natural resource sector would play in getting us there. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653636">Madam Speaker, I think there is a lot of misconception as to the future of our oil and gas. Are we going to completely eliminate it? Probably not. There are many sides of it that we need to consider, such as using it as a lubricant in the future. We know that we still need to have lubricants, whether it is for our car transmissions, car rear ends or even ball joints, for grease. Could we start looking at other alternatives such as blue hydrogen coming from our natural gas sector? There are other potential alternatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653637">Will we start looking at minimizing the amount of consumption? Absolutely. However, we need to look at some of the other positives that we get from the oil and gas industry in the future. It is just not that simplistic that we will be able to remove it completely.

I am not so certain as to whether it should be defined as 40% or what number we should look at, but to start reducing our emissions and getting to carbon neutral by 2050, we need to have a plan that is going to adjust and we need to ensure it is a reasonable plan. As we have seen from the Liberals in the last few years, they have not come anywhere close to their emissions targets. Therefore, to set targets that are not realistic does not help. </ParaText>

It was introduced in November, and now we find ourselves with a time allocation. This really does need to be debated in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653647">I know how very carefully the parliamentary secretary and the minister, when they speak of all parties in this place ready to support this bill, somehow do not mention the Green Party of Canada, the party that is known and trusted by Canadians, more than any other, to put climate at the centre of what we do to ensure sustainability and that future generations have a hospitable climate, one that will sustain the human civilization going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653648">Therefore, when we hear the words “climate accountability act” and “net-zero by 2050”, we think they really do sound good. I know a lot of people will be stunned to realize that I, as someone who has worked on the climate issue for as long as I have, starting in 1986 on the early stages of negotiating the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and being at the Rio Earth Summit, and so many other conferences I do not even want to go back and remember them all, I am struggling with how I am going to vote on this bill. How is it that I could think that it could be dangerous? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653649">I will explain how that is, and I will make my comments in two parts. The first will look to the science. This is all about the science. We have to get it right. There are such things as carbon budgets, which are not included in this legislation. We know that the Liberals are talking about net-zero by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653650">Let me reference for a moment Greta Thunberg. We all know she is a very dedicated climate activist. Greta Thunberg says net-zero by 2050 is “surrender” because it gives politicians the illusion that we have time, we have a couple of decades, we can work toward this and we can figure it out. That is not the case anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653651">Let me quote someone the Liberals will have heard of. In his book <I>Value(s): Building a Better World for All</I>, Mark Carney explains carbon budgets probably better than anyone I have ever heard. On page 273 of the book, he writes, “The carbon budget to limit temperature rises to below catastrophic levels is rapidly being exhausted. If we had started in 2000, we could have hit the 1.5°C objective by halving emissions every 30 years. Now, we must halve emissions every 10 years. If we wait another four years, the challenge will be to halve emissions every year. If we wait another eight years, our 1.5°C carbon budget will be exhausted.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653652">How can we have a climate accountability act that has its first milestone year at 2030? Clearly, that is too late.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653654"> Here is what he said: “We have to drastically increase everyone's targets if we want to achieve the 1.5-degree objective.... 2030 is the new 2050.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653655">They cannot get much clearer than that: 2030 is the new 2050. We have legislation here that tells us we will be all right, we will have our first milestone year in 2030. That is past the time of any accountability for the current government and past any accountability for probably the next one too. What we need to do is make this bill work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653656"> I think it can be fixed, but I am very worried because the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> asked me and the Green Party to propose amendments back in December. We have proposed the key thing, and without consulting Parliament, without waiting until we got to second reading and committee, he has already negated one of the key things that needs to be fixed in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653657">Turning now from the science to the policy, there are climate accountability acts in about 12 countries around the world right now. The gold standard is the law the U.K. brought in in 2008. It set up an expert, independent, arm's-length group, a climate accountability institute that actually advises government as a whole, not just the minister and not just a multi-stakeholder group, but an expert group with arm's-length capacity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653658">That was one of my key recommendations to the minister, to make sure that the group advising the minister is an expert group made up of scientists. Without waiting to go to committee to see if my amendment might pass, we now have an appointed group, and it is a multi-stakeholder group, without independence from government, advising the minister and creating delays in the way it negotiates and moves forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653659">To have a 2025 milestone year, we need to do one thing and we need to know the minister is open to it, and he has already told the media that he is not open to it. We need to have the target for 2025 baked into the legislation before third reading. Now that the government says it is heading to 45%, which is far too weak if we are looking at the science, and I will get back to this if I have a moment, we need to at least say that by 2025 we will have a 25% reduction, or even 15%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653660">That needs to be baked into the legislation, so we have some accountability. The way the legislation works, it also says that two years before we hit the first milestone, we would have the first reporting event. That would be very consistent with the Paris agreement and the requirement for a global stock-take year in 2023. To get on the right page for that, we really do need a 2025 milestone year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653661">Again, looking at climate accountability legislation all around the world, something else they have in common is that the first milestone year every time is within five years. The U.K., as I mentioned, first passed legislation in 2008. It also passed legislation in 2019, and its first milestone year was 2025. New Zealand brought in its legislation, and within five years of it passing, 2025 was its first milestone year.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6653686">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak, albeit briefly, to Bill <Document DbId="10959361" Type="3">C-12</Document> and the amendment the Conservative House leader has put forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653687">We have been critical of many aspects of this bill from the beginning for a specific reason. It is because this bill is another signalling bill without substance. Too often, we have seen that on many important economic, environmental and cultural challenges facing the country, the government opts to signal its concern for the issue without putting in place a real or effective plan. The government's response to the environmental challenges we face has so often involved seeking to raise taxes and seeking to signal its concern through ever-changing evaluation metrics and targets without ever actually putting in place structures that would bind them or that would effectively address the global challenge this represents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653688">That is why Conservatives have put forward a constructive amendment, which recognizes the realities of the challenges associated with climate change. Certainly we would hope the government members vote for this amendment. To vote against this amendment would imply they do not believe in the science of climate change, since the amendment says right in it that it recognizes the challenge of climate change and the need to address it. Our amendment also highlights the need to integrate a commitment to economic growth with addressing the environmental challenges we face. Fundamentally, Conservatives believe we can do both: that we can work to respond to climate change and that we can build and strengthen our economy in the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653689">We hear lip service paid to this idea from various parts of the House, the integration of a concern for the environment and a concern for the economy, but we very rarely see a plan that actually responds to the global challenge and strengthens our economy at the same time. From a Conservative perspective, we are looking at the challenge of climate change as a global challenge. We believe that the specific policy measures we take in response to this global challenge have to have some recognition of the global scope of that problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653690">Importantly, that does not mean not acting. Recognizing that Canada represents less than 2% of global emissions is not an excuse to not act, but what it should impel us to do is act in such a way as contributes to the global problem of climate change. I think, most crucially, that should involve developing new technologies and working to promote the deployment of those technologies in a broader way around the world. We are not going to to respond to the global problem of climate change by simply taking action that reduces our emissions here in Canada, if the effect of those emissions reductions is simply greater emissions outside the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653691">What we have from the Liberals are policies that kneecap our own industries, but impose no restrictions or additional costs on companies that are producing the same products outside Canada and then exporting those products back to us. In other words, if we are taxing producers in Canada, and as a result of that taxation those producers go outside the country, produce the same products and sell those products to Canadians, we are seeing the same or greater emissions and there is no economic or environmental policy the government is putting in place to deter that practice, it very clearly does not makes sense to, in the name of environmental policy, push producers beyond our borders without actually requiring those reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653692">The Conservative approach to this, as an alternative to this policy of pushing production outside the country but having the same production take place, calls for the development and deployment of new technology that would allow the production of energy in a cleaner way and also for border adjustments. Also, there is a new idea which I think is a very important one, that says that if companies are moving outside Canada and selling their products back to us, there has to be some adjustment at the border to take into consideration that they may not be paying a price on carbon that exists here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653693">If we encourage the development of cleaner energy technology in Canada for export around the world, and put in place measures to ensure those who are outside the country selling their products to Canadians do not have some unfair advantage over domestic production, we are actually recognizing the global scope of the problem.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6653694">With over 98% of the world's emissions happening outside of Canada, the development and deployment of new technology here will really make that critical difference. We are not seeing a plan like this from the Liberals. They are content to impose additional costs and requirements on Canadian industry and Canadian consumers without treating the global nature of the problem, which is the companies from abroad that have lower environmental standards selling their products into Canada. That does not make any sense. It looks like we are going after Canadian industry to make a point, without actually targeting the global nature of the problem. That is why the Conservatives have presented an alternative plan. That is why we have presented a constructive amendment here at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653695">The other issue our amendment highlights is this. In addition to not having a clear plan to address the global challenge we face, the Liberals have already put in place individuals on the advisory body that is contemplated in this bill. How disrespectful to Parliament can they be by already putting in place a panel that is envisioned by the legislation? That presumes the legislation will pass in its present form.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653959">Following up on the point of order that she raised on February 16, concerning their participation in Oral Questions on Wednesday, on which I ruled on February 23, the member focused on the number of questions allocated to them during each sitting week. Since the number of independent members and members of non-recognized parties has risen from four to eight since the beginning of this Parliament, she feels that the number of questions should also increase.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6653960"> As the one responsible for keeping deliberations running smoothly, the Chair is aware of the number and distribution of questions allocated during question period. I should add that, while the member raised the question from a different angle, I am still obliged to reconcile the three fundamental elements to which I have already referred rather than to address it by limiting the matter to a simple mathematical formula. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6653961">The first element is complying with our established practice. In this case, that means the practice of allocating Oral Questions primarily on the basis of negotiations among the recognized parties in the House. I note that this practice has changed in recent years, which has made it possible to give independent members and members of non-recognized parties a larger share of the questions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6653962">The second, and I find that this relatively recent development has certain limits, relates to the wording of Standing Order 30, since 45 minutes are reserved for question period. The Chair has to make every effort to ensure that this rule is respected as much as possible, similar to ensuring the rules of governing the management of speaking times during our deliberations are adhered to. Members have undoubtedly noticed, as I have, that for many years now, it has been difficult to respect this standing order to the letter.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6653963">The third is linked to my responsibility to protect the rights of all members and, as I stated in my ruling last February 23, to find “a balance between the rights and interests of the majority and of those of the minority. In doing so, the Chair must try to be equitable and fair, without tipping the balance too far on one side or the other.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6653964">In keeping with my commitment as Speaker to encourage meetings to ensure that our institution has harmonious parliamentary procedures that are based on co-operation, and having always insisted on the importance of co-operation to improve the decorum, process and overall operations of the House, I encouraged the member for <Affiliation DbId="252941" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> to continue her efforts. I continue to believe that this is the approach most likely to produce a solution. In the meantime, I cannot unilaterally alter the agreement and practices already in place, unless the groups concerned reach an agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653965">Because this question has been raised in the past, and given the parameters of the Chair's authority in the matter, I reiterate my request that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs study the question. </ParaText>

For over two and a half years, we have supported the parties throughout the collective bargaining process in the hope of them arriving at a negotiated agreement. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6653982">Let me be clear. The government will continue to support the parties and strongly encourages them to reach an agreement as soon as possible. Let me provide some context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653983">The Port of Montreal is the second-largest container port in Canada. Every year it handles over 1.6 million 20-foot equivalent units and 35 million tonnes of cargo, representing approximately $40 billion in goods. It is also a major link in the various Canadian and American supply chains for raw materials and consumer goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653984">The work stoppage we are seeing right now is causing harm. It has the potential to cause severe, immediate and lasting damage to the economies of Montreal, the province of Quebec and Canada. This work stoppage affects more than 19,000 direct and indirect jobs associated with transit through the Port of Montreal, including in the rail and trucking industry. In fact, it would affect the jobs of up to 250,000 employees in Montreal and 273,000 workers in Ontario employed in the production of shipping container products. Shippers that have been forced to reroute to other ports may not return immediately. They may not even return in the long term, meaning that the negative impacts on Montreal, Quebec and all of Canada could last longer as the work stoppage continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653985">The Port of Montreal is a major link in many Canadian and American supply chains of raw materials and consumer goods. These goods are fundamental to the manufacturing, agriculture and health industries, among many others. Vital PPE arrives via the Port of Montreal. Important goods to various manufacturing industries do as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653986">The August 2020 strike had a disruptive and protracted effect on the east coast transportation system. More than 21 ships were diverted to other ports, including Halifax and Saint John, leading to congestion, longer transit times and additional costs for shippers. The current work stoppage is leading to similar rerouting to other ports, including in the U.S. This is having a strong negative economic impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653987">Earlier this year, long before the strike action took place, we heard from stakeholders such as the Shipping Federation of Canada, which stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653988">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The mere threat of a work stoppage by longshore workers at the Port of Montreal is forcing North American importers and exporters to divert large volumes of international cargo away from the port and is already causing havoc to supply chains... </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653989">At that time, the Montreal Port Authority also confirmed that some of its clients had pre-emptively diverted container goods to other ports. Of course, it is important to point out that we are in the midst of the pandemic and COVID-19 has exacerbated this situation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6653990">If these diversions to American ports become permanent, they could have long-lasting negative effects on the integrated transportation and logistics network around the Port of Montreal. A direct effect would be lower demand for rail and trucking services in Canada that support the movement of cargo between Canada and the United States. We also know that production and manufacturing in natural resource sectors, such as forestry, were seriously impacted during the strike last summer. These sectors are once again seeing major impacts to their supply chains with this latest action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653991">For example, the Prince Edward Island Federation of Agriculture has said that seed, fertilizer, crop protection and other important inputs arrive at the port destined for farms across the region that need them to successfully get their crops in the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653992">Small businesses that rely on the Port of Montreal for supplies will be especially hard pressed to absorb the extra costs associated with the work stoppage if it is left to continue for a long period. Many of these smaller businesses cannot afford high-cost alternatives, such as expediting cargo through busy ports along the east coast of the U.S. at the last minute. They often cannot afford to pay workers while their businesses remain idle as they wait for operations at the Port of Montreal to return to normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653993">All of this comes at a precarious moment in Canada's economic recovery from the ongoing pandemic. Supply chains have been disrupted for over a year now. Industries are working very hard to recover from and manage these complexities. These industries employ workers who are not just numbers: They are people who depend on their jobs to take care of themselves and their families and all those who depend on them. For businesses in central and eastern Canada, this second major work stoppage at one of the main gateways to international suppliers and markets is a serious blow in the already challenging COVID-19 environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653994">The impact on our economy of these disruptions to supply chains will be devastating. Ensuring the uninterrupted flow of commodities and goods to and from international and domestic markets through the Port of Montreal is essential to the economic well-being of Canadians across the country, particularly now as we enter a period of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653995">The Government of Canada has provided significant assistance to the parties. Over the last two and a half years, a federal government mediator has supported over 100 bargaining sessions. Despite our best efforts and this support, there is no agreement in sight as the parties remain unable to find common ground. This has now resulted in yet another disruption at the port with very real consequences for multiple industries that depend on access to international markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653996">Our government firmly believes that the best deals are reached at the bargaining table. However, intervention is sometimes necessary when the parties are at a significant and long-standing impasse, particularly when a work stoppage is causing significant harm to Canadians. We cannot allow the situation we saw in August 2020 to repeat itself, particularly in the midst of this pandemic. If the current stoppage continues, serious accumulated and negative impacts will continue to be felt all over Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653997">Canadians are counting on us to help the parties resolve their differences as quickly as possible to avoid a worsening of the situation. Stakeholders are counting on us as well, many of whom have already reached out directly to urge the government to do everything in its power to protect the economy, workers' jobs and the well-being of Canadians. As I mentioned earlier, the government will continue to support the parties in their negotiations, and it strongly encourages them to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We take the use of this legislation very seriously. It is our least-favoured option. I very strongly encourage the parties to reach a deal as soon as possible before this legislation is passed. The parties are at the table now. I hope the message continues to be heard loud and clear, but we cannot afford to wait.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6653998">We are committed to free and collective bargaining, and we believe in the collective bargaining process. Negotiated agreements are always the best solution. The parties began this round of collective bargaining in September 2018, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service has been involved since October 2018.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6653999">In the last two and a half years, the parties have met over 100 times. This is a significant investment on the part of the government and clearly demonstrates our commitment to the process. The existing collective bargaining agreement expired on December 31, 2018. The agreement covers all approximately 1,100 workers employed by the member companies of the MEA engaged in the loading and unloading of vessels, and other related work at the Port of Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654000">On October 11, 2018, the government appointed a conciliation officer from the federal mediation and conciliation service. On December 11, we appointed two mediators to attempt to help the parties resolve their differences and reach an agreement that worked for everyone. On February 4, 2021, I added two senior mediators to this file to assist the parties in their negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654001">The Canada Industrial Relations Board has also been involved in this dispute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654002"> On October 23, the MEA filed an application with the Canada Industrial Relations Board to determine which activities would need to be maintained in the event of a work stoppage at the port to prevent an immediate and serious danger to the safety or health of the public. Neither party could initiate a work stoppage until the CIRB decided on the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654003">The proceedings before the CIRB and related litigation in federal court lasted over a year. During this time, the parties continued to bargain with the help of the federal mediators, holding 40 bargaining sessions between December 11, 2018 and June 8, 2020, the date the CIRB decision was rendered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654004">Ultimately the CIRB found that the parties did not need to maintain any activities in the event of the work stoppage beyond their statutory obligation under the Canada Labour Code to continue service for grain vessels. However, the CIRB did acknowledge the union's commitment to continuing servicing two vessels that supplied Newfoundland and Labrador. The parties were legally entitled to begin a strike or lockout as of the date of the decision, provided they gave the 72-hour notice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654005">Less than a month after the CIRB decision was released, with the support of 99% of its membership, the union commenced a partial strike on July 2, 2020. Four work stoppages followed that summer, each one increasing in duration and impact, ending an unlimited strike that started on August 10, 2020. There was also increasing tension around the port on August 13, 2020. Eight people were arrested and charged with intimidation, mischief and assault, following a confrontation between union members and managers who were brought in as replacement workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654006">Eleven days later, on August 21, 2020, the parties agreed to a seven-month truce, during the period of which they would keep bargaining and assume all port activities. That truce ended on March 21, 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654007"> Throughout these events, the parties have continued to receive intense mediation support from the federal mediators. I want to take this opportunity to thank the federal mediators for their support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654008">However, despite these ongoing mediation efforts, at the start of February, the MEA filed a bad faith bargaining complaint with the CIRB, asking it to order the parties to binding arbitration. The CIRB issued its ruling on March 17, finding that any determination of bad faith bargaining would be premature, as the parties were still working on the negotiation of a new collective agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654009">My colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, and I have also reached out to the parties directly to urge them to continue to work toward an agreement. Despite these efforts, negotiations remain stalled and no end is in sight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654010"> On April 10, the employer gave 72 hours' notice of its intention to modify the conditions of employment for members of CUPE 375. According to the notice, employees would no longer be guaranteed a minimum weekly income and would instead be remunerated only for hours worked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654011">Later that same day, the union gave 72 hours' notice of its intention to no longer perform overtime, work on weekends or participate in training. The union committed to maintaining services for vessels coming to and from Newfoundland and Labrador, and services for grain vessels that must be maintained in accordance with section 87.7(1) of the Canada Labour Code, which specifies that in the event of a job action, the movement of grain must not be affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654012">On April 13, the parties implemented the actions described in their respective notices. Recently, the situation has escalated. On April 22, the employer advised the union that it would be invoking the provisions of the collective agreement that imposed a specific shift schedule requiring workers to work the entire shift.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654013">The following day, the union gave notice of its intention to stop all work at the port, beginning at 7 a.m. on April 26. On Monday morning, that is exactly what happened, a complete general strike, unlimited in duration, began at the Port of Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654014">The parties have reached an impasse and it is clear that despite ongoing assistance from federal mediators for the last two and a half years, they remain unable to find a common ground. We urgently need to find a way to move forward, particularly in light of the recent escalation in job action, which has paralyzed the port.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654015"> Our government has done everything we could to help the parties resolve their differences without a stoppage. We believe in the collective bargaining process. There are, however, exceptional circumstances where the government must step in. This is one of those exceptional circumstances. The impact is vast and deep and the situation is dire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654016">When it is only the two parties at the bargaining table that stand to suffer grave consequences as a result of work stoppage, there is no justification for the government to intervene. However, when a strike or lockout is disrupting the economy to the degree that it has and has caused significant and permanent damage to the livelihoods and well-being of Canadians across the country, such as what we are seeing with this escalating work stoppage at the Port of Montreal, the government must intervene even if it is to intervene with a heavy heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654017">Canadians are counting on medicines and medical equipment, farmers are counting on receipt of seed and fertilizer to grow crops and feed Canadians and Canadians are counting on products and goods, including food, medicines and medical equipment, specifically dialysis products. This is a concern in the best of times. Now, in the midst of a pandemic, these concerns are heightened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654018">I have heard messages from stakeholders loud and clear. This is literally a matter of life and death has been the message communicated to me. If medical products and life-saving medical devices do not get to hospitals and patients in a timely manner, the health of Canadians is at stake. We know there are ships currently with COVID-related products, pharmaceutical and medical equipment, that now cannot get through. The impacts are vast and deep. Ensuring the uninterrupted flow of these goods is critical at this time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654019">The parties could not reach a negotiated agreement after two and a half years of negotiations, and the help of a federal mediator at over 100 bargaining sessions. We cannot afford to wait any longer to intervene. There is too much at stake. We must act before irreparable damage is done to the economies of Montreal, the Province of Quebec and Canada as well as the health and safety of Canadians across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654020">We will continue to work with both parties in an effort to help them find common ground. The federal government will continue to support the negotiations between the parties. As I have said, the parties are currently at the table. We strongly encourage them, with the support of the federal mediation and conciliation service, to come to an agreement at the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654021">We also have a responsibility to act in the interests of Canadians whose lives and livelihoods are affected by the work stoppage, which is the result of failure to reach a negotiated agreement after the two and a half years of federally supported negotiations of the Syndicat des débardeurs, known also as CUPE Local 375, and the Maritime Employers Association. That is why we are introducing this legislation today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654051">Normally, I am always pleased and enthusiastic to rise in the House. However, today, it is quite the opposite. Rising in the House to debate and pass special legislation to force employees back to work is the furthest thing from a victory. It is not a victory for workers, for the employer, or for the business people and companies dealing with the problems resulting from the dispute, and it is certainly not a victory for parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654052">Parliament's job is to pass bills that help society move forward, not to force people back to work. Unfortunately, we are obligated to debate this motion, which will lead to the passage of special legislation forcing Port of Montreal dock workers back to work. Obviously, we have a lot to say about that. We are here because the Liberal government, and particularly the <Affiliation DbId="252780" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and member for Papineau, a Montreal riding, unfortunately failed to show leadership at the appropriate time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654053">Let us consider the facts. The Port of Montreal is extremely essential. It is the beating heart of Montreal's economy, Quebec's economy and Canada's economy because goods that go through the port end up everywhere. That is why we have to pass this bill, which will cause port operations that have been stalled for more than a day now to resume.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654054">The Port of Montreal is a crucial economic tool. It is Canada's second-largest port. Some 40 million tonnes of cargo and two billion products go through the Port of Montreal. For that to work, the port has to be efficient and reliable. Unfortunately, it is neither at the moment. This dispute is tarnishing the Port of Montreal's reputation, and now 1,150 dock workers are on strike because of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654055">This dispute has deep roots. For nearly two and a half years now, the Port of Montreal's 1,150 dock workers have been without a contract. Anyone working for an organization wants to know what to expect. Disputes may arise occasionally, and contracts have to be renegotiated from time to time, but when it takes almost two and a half years to reach an agreement, that does not fly, and that is when problems come up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654056">These workers have been without a contract since December 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654057">Members will recall the sad events of last summer, when the Port of Montreal was hit by a 19-day labour dispute. Over those 19 days, $600 million was reportedly lost due to the work stoppage at the port. It took three months for economic activity to return to normal and for the backlog to clear. Since everything was shut down for 19 days, the containers piled up and could not be moved. The total economic impact of the dispute was $600 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654058">Given the pressures of last summer, in the middle of a pandemic, we would have expected negotiations to resume civilly so that the parties could quickly find some middle ground. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Instead, there was a seven-month truce, but it did not last.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654059">There was an attempt at mediation. Experienced mediators were called in to help move things along. We recognize that. More importantly, however, we recognize that it did not work. That is the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654060">The government claims to have goodwill and talks about how terrible this is. I heard the minister talk about her goodwill earlier. Incidentally, I want to congratulate the minister for speaking a few sentences in French. I do not doubt her goodwill, but we need to see some results. There are no results to speak of. That is why the Prime Minister should have shown some leadership. I will come back to the lack of leadership a little later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654061">Every day this strike continues is costing our economy between $10 million and $20 million, which is huge. This is the second day of the strike, so it is time to move forward. Using special legislation is messy. No one wants that. I used to sit in the National Assembly in Quebec, and I had to vote on special legislation. As an opposition member, I agreed with the government's approach, but I could not applaud the passing of special legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654062">Special legislation undermines confidence in Parliament since it must be adopted quickly. It also causes upheaval in society when the government forces unionized workers who are striking legally to return to work and negotiate with their employers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654063">From the outset, I will say that we want to keep the economy rolling. We want the workers at thousands of plants, primarily in Quebec and Ontario, to be able to resume work and have access to the goods that flow through the port. We want them to be able to ship their products through the Port of Montreal. For that to happen, the workers need to return to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654064">In her speech, the minister said that this dispute would directly affect 250,000 jobs in Quebec and 270,000 in Ontario. As members can see, this conflict is not a local, municipal or provincial issue. It is a Canadian one. Companies in western Canada and in the Maritimes will be directly affected by this as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654065">Sadly, we will recall that during last summer's dispute about twenty vessels destined for the Port of Montreal were redirected to other ports such as the Port of Halifax. This has been happening again for the past several weeks. Why? It is because the government did not show leadership at the right time to prevent this dispute. Unfortunately, it was not prevented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654066">The Quebec government is calling for special legislation to be passed because Quebec's economy is being affected by this situation. Business people also want operations to resume. We completely agree. We also know that the unions think passing special legislation is appalling. That is true. Unfortunately, we believe that this government failed to show leadership. I will explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654067">When such serious disputes arise, when positions are irreconcilable and there is no flexibility on certain aspects that could move things forward, that is when political leadership must be shown and unfortunately that did not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654068">I will never understand why the member for <Affiliation DbId="252780" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation>, who is from the Montreal area, the Prime Minister of Canada, who has all the authority to act, did not do anything about a dispute that is happening just a few kilometres from his riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654069">The Prime Minister had a fundamental duty to pick up the phone last week and call the union and the Port of Montreal management, to encourage them to work things out and ask them what the issues were. That is a prime minister's job. That is where leadership is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654070">When every effort has been made to resolve a conflict but unfortunately nothing is working, the Prime Minister needs to step up and do something. Instead, this Prime Minister said the parties had to be left to their negotiations to see if that would work. That did not work for two and a half years. In a case like this, it is important to think outside the box. That is where leadership comes in, and that is where leadership was lacking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654071">The Prime Minister and member for Papineau, from the Montreal region, did not have the courage to do the right thing. That is why we find ourselves in this situation today, the same situation we sadly decried quite a while ago. I say “sadly” because we would have preferred not to do that. More than a month ago, when we felt no progress was being made, we asked questions in the House. The member for <Affiliation DbId="253044" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252525" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation> rose in the House to question the government and ensure that it would take action to avoid a dispute. Unfortunately, that is what we are facing now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654072">We are currently suffering the repercussions of the third wave of the pandemic, which, as members know, were exacerbated by the current government's tardiness in procuring vaccines when it mattered. We are now suffering the consequences of the 10-day gap in January and February.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654073">Business people were hard hit by the lack of access to supplies and equipment during the rail crisis almost two years ago. Then they were hit by the pandemic and eventually the third wave. On top of all that, they are now facing the labour dispute at the Port of Montreal. Thousands of jobs throughout Quebec, Ontario and Canada are at stake. Unfortunately, this government failed by not showing the necessary leadership. Now we have to debate this bill, which has to pass so that operations can resume at the Port of Montreal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654074">Mr. Speaker, I do not know how many members of this House ever had the opportunity to sit at a bargaining table on the union side, but I did. The only power that labour ultimately has is the right to withdraw its services. Without that, it has no ultimate negotiating power. Here is something else: Strikes cause economic pressure; that is the very point of them. That right does not just exist for labour whose withdrawal of services does not produce consequences. It is like saying that workers with effective strike pressure cannot exercise that right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654075">At the Port of Montreal, the government is intervening before those workers even have a chance to exercise their right or exert pressure. My hon. colleague said that this is not a victory for employers or employees. Well, it is a victory for employers, because no employers sit at a table and bargain seriously if they know that a government will intervene and ultimately take away the right of the workers to strike, and guarantee an arbitrated result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654076">Why does the member not support workers' rights to strike and exercise the only fundamental constitutional right they have, or is that a right only for workers whose withdrawal of services does not actually impact anybody?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6654090">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to speak to this House, this time from Chilliwack remotely. My hon. colleague, the opposition House leader, had excellent remarks. I am always pleased to share the virtual stage with him. He mentioned a few things that I want to build on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654091">Primarily, government members like to pat themselves on the back for their intentions. They always have good intentions and think that should be enough to get them kudos for how they operate. Good intentions do not equal good results. While the minister talked about having a heavy heart and she had good intentions to facilitate a deal, the fact is that they did not get it done. To quote Michael Ignatieff, “They didn't get it done”, so we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654092">That is disappointing. None of us are happy that we are here debating back-to-work legislation. Back-to-work legislation indicates a failure. It indicates that there has been a failure from the government to facilitate a negotiated settlement, that the bargaining has broken down and that this is, as the minister said, the last tool in the tool box, but here we are. It is being deployed. That is something we have heard. Certainly, I spoke to the union today. It said that once the minister telegraphed, some time ago, that back-to-work legislation was an option she was considering, the negotiations fell off the table. The negotiations started to get less serious and no longer were tackling the issues at the heart of this dispute, because one side could say it would wait to see what the government does before bringing forward ideas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654093">I think that has been really unfortunate. As was said by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252984" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>, when the pressure is removed from a negotiation, there is no more impetus to come to the best deal. A pressure valve has been released by the government here. To signal that before a strike was even under way was truly unfortunate. From the reports that we are hearing on the ground, it did have a negative impact on negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654094">We have seen that when there is a deadline, it seems the government fails to manage a file even more than usual. When there is a hard deadline, the government's failures increase. We saw it last fall, when the CERB benefits were going to run out. We all got pushed up against the wall because the government had failed to manage the timeline. We saw it with medical aid in dying, where the government absolutely failed to respond to court deadlines. We saw it with the U.K. trade agreement, where the government has failed to meet deadlines. Now, with a seven-month truce period, the government has failed to facilitate a negotiated settlement between the union and the employer. Once again, this deadline was known. It is not a surprise, and neither is the situation at the Port of Montreal a surprise, but the government has failed to get a deal done with the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654095">We know that the Port of Montreal is extremely important to the country. It is the second-busiest port in the country and it has connections to more than 140 countries. It is the largest port in eastern Canada: 40 million tonnes of cargo were handled in 2019; 2,500 trucks a day go through that port, and 60 to 80 trains a week; there are $2.6 billion in economic benefits, $250 million in tax revenue, and over 19,000 direct and indirect jobs; a hundred billion dollars' worth of goods go through there. We cannot overstate the importance of the port, and we cannot overstate as well the difficulty that has been felt around the world because of the uncertainty that is happening at the port.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654096"> We saw that with the August 2020 shutdown, when there was a $600-million cost to the economy for a 19-day strike. It took three months after that strike for port activities to get back to where they were and for the backlogs to be cleared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654097">We know that, as we go forward, any work stoppage is going to have a massive impact on Canada's economy, at a time when we can afford it the least. We already have some of the highest unemployment rates in the G7. We have seen the pandemic have a devastating impact on small businesses right across the country, and the last thing they can afford is a prolonged stoppage that will impact their bottom line again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654098">We have also talked to the port itself, which is not the employer in this situation but is an interested party. It has indicated that since the truce ended, it has seen about a 10% drop in shipping volumes. That is before any action was taken by either side, before any work stoppage occurred. At the same time, ports in New York and New Jersey and Norfolk were seeing a corresponding increase in traffic as the shippers from around the world were making decisions on the reliability of the Port of Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654099">That is what is at stake here: the continued questions about the reliability of the port. By failing to get a deal done, by failing to facilitate a deal, those questions remain, so people and businesses are making decisions that will impact workers not only at the port but right across the country. If the volumes do not come back and the 10% decline becomes a permanent decline, that will result in fewer union jobs. If we cannot get product across the country to manufacturing facilities, that will result in fewer jobs and the impacts will be felt all along the supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654100">We Conservatives, too, believe in the collective bargaining process. This is the process that the government says it had good intentions to support, but it failed to help the two parties come to an agreement. We want these decisions to be made at the table, without the guillotine, if we want to call it that, of back-to-work legislation hanging over their heads. The best deals are made at the table between willing parties. Certainly we want to reiterate our support for collective bargaining, and that we are not celebrating today that the government has taken this action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654101">However, we do believe that Canada cannot afford a prolonged work stoppage at this port. We cannot afford to see companies choosing to temporarily or permanently shift their operations to other ports. As the CEO of the Port of Montreal has indicated, extra dollars to move a product using a different port are one thing, but reliability is non-negotiable. Companies cannot have their products tied up in port or be unsure that they will be able to get to the customers in a timely fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654102">It is unfortunate that we are here today. It is unfortunate that the government was unable to facilitate a deal between the two parties. We do not celebrate the fact that this is before us, but here we are. We have to make a choice, and we choose to support the Canadian economy and support the workers right across the supply chain who are relying on the products that come through that port.</ParaText>

I wanted to mention something that he raised, which is the fact that a very significant percentage of work in the port relates to the Midwest of the United States. The port has already seen a 19% decline in goods that were originally ordered by customers in the American Midwest. If we do not see a final resolution, not a temporary one, but a final resolution to this uncertainty, it is highly likely that we will continue to see an erosion of the business the port does with the United States.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654111">The real danger here is that, with a couple of work stoppages in such a short period of time, questions about the long-term reliability of the port are obviously raised. We cannot make a decision about shipping the weekend before something arrives at a port. The decisions have to be made a long time in advance. The uncertainty has caused a number of companies to make decisions to move away from the Port of Montreal, and to move away from the economic activity coming into that port and coming into Canada. We cannot afford for the temporary redirection to U.S. ports to become permanent. That is why we are supporting the effort to get certainty here because the long-term economic damage would be too great.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654114">Mr. Speaker, the government should have used all the tools in its toolbox before coming to back-to-work legislation. It is obviously the hammer in that toolbox, and it is a tool that governments should be very hesitant to use. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654115">As I have said numerous times, whether the government's intentions were good, whether it sat in on a number of meetings or not, the fact of the matter is that it did not get the job done. They have not yet reached a negotiated settlement. In fact, we are being told that in the last number of days, as the pressure has been released because of the threat of this back-to-work legislation, the prospects of a negotiated settlement have done nothing but decline. It is very unfortunate that the government failed to facilitate a negotiated settlement in this case.</ParaText>

If that is the case, I know that they will agree that a fundamental tenet of labour rights is free collective bargain. Back-to-work legislation tips the scale, as the member acknowledged, for the employer, and essentially robs the union of any chance of free collective bargaining in a fair way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654117">We still have a chance to do this. What it takes is for the Conservatives to vote against this back-to-work legislation motion and send a clear signal to the employers, so they know they need to get back to the table to negotiate fairly with the union. We also need to send the government back to do its work without wielding the hammer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654123">Before I start, I would like to apologize to the interpreters because I will not be reading a text. I know that they like to have a copy of our speaking notes, and I understand why. I will try not to speak too quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654124">I want to start by paying tribute to all workers because tomorrow, April 28, is the National Day of Mourning for those killed or injured on the job. It is an opportunity to remember that we must work together to ensure that workplaces are healthy and safe. This includes harmonious labour relations and good living and working conditions for workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654125">Today is a dark day. It is sunny outside, but it is a dark day in the House when the government introduces special legislation to end negotiations and deprive workers of any means of action. No, it is not the last resort or the only option, and no, it is not inevitable. It would have been possible to take another course of action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654126">I am not going to spend 10 minutes going over all of the International Labour Organization conventions that Canada has signed, but I do want to point out one thing. The Port of Montreal workers and the employer are trying to renew a contract that expired nearly two years ago. This process requires free collective bargaining, a balance of power and the ability to take action, such as a strike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654127">In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada constitutionalized the right to strike in a precedent-setting case involving health care, highway and other public sector workers in Saskatchewan. I will not read out the entire ruling, because that would take me until midnight, but the Supreme Court found that without the right to strike, the right to bargain collectively is meaningless. The court concluded that a prohibition on designated employees participating in strike action as part of the bargaining process amounts to a substantial interference with collective bargaining. Therefore, the right to strike is constitutionally protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654128">The special legislation before us denies two fundamental rights: the right to free collective bargaining and the right to strike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654129">We are being asked to act urgently because action is urgently needed and there is no other choice. That is not true. There were plenty of signals during negotiations that should have alerted the department of labour, the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself that this labour dispute would not be easily resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654130">The government cannot simply send in the best, most experienced mediators for 100 days, read their reports, and then decide that the negotiations are not going anywhere and that it will do nothing. Doing nothing is not an answer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654131">The latest signal came on April 9 when the employer sent a notice regarding job security and then changed work schedules a few days later. Those facts alone helped escalate the dispute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654132">Workers took job action, first with an overtime strike and then with a weekend strike before moving on to an unlimited general strike. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654133">Not just one but four times in one week, the union stated publicly for all to hear that, if the employer were to walk back these two changes, which were a violation of the collective agreement, the union members would cease all job action. That was a strong signal. Did the employer just not hear them? Why did the employer not take action and try to strike a balance in order to pursue mediation? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654134">That is not what happened though. The threat of special legislation has been looming for about a month now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654135">How could free collective bargaining and a balance of power prevail when everyone knew the government would hand the employer special legislation on a silver platter before workers even staged an unlimited general strike, which is the most useful pressure tactic?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654136">I want to make it clear that workers are never happy about getting to that point in a dispute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654137">This government could have shown leadership. When we look closely at what is happening with the labour dispute, we see that there were other signals. As I was saying during question period, there was a strike last August. Economic and labour force stakeholders were already sending signals that the government needed to do something to help the parties reach a negotiated collective agreement. They were worried about what had happened and the impact that those strike days would have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654138">At that point, the government could have thought about what conditions it should implement besides special mediators. When disputes start to escalate and it seems that no agreement will be reached, the Minister of Labour and the Prime Minister should at least show an interest in what is happening. They should at least make some calls, offer to listen to both parties and try to find ways to help bridge the gap between them. I will not talk here about the basics of good bargaining with good governance, but the government has let this labour relations issue go on for too long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654139">I would also remind the House that the parties have been negotiating for two and a half years, or 30 months to be exact. This is turning into a farce. In the first year of negotiations, the employer itself took the union to court to try to take away its right to strike. The employer lost, because the Supreme Court upheld the union's right to strike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654140">The bill before us negates that. The first clause of the bill extends the term of the collective agreement to include the period beginning in January. However, this does not guarantee that the union will be go back to work based on the agreement. Considering what has happened in the last few weeks, this would be like going back to work with the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654141">A mediator-arbitrator will have the powers and duties to select the terms of the collective agreement, depending on the final offer. We see this as another right being violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654142">For all these reasons, we cannot support the special legislation before us. Instead, every possible effort must be made to ensure genuine negotiations, in order to remove this sword of Damocles from above the workers' heads. The government has a duty to do so.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654157">I think that we all need to learn from her compelling experience in organized labour, and the government would do well to listen to people like her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654158">The situation we are in right now is a little unusual. The strike at the Port of Montreal was not unexpected, since this labour dispute has been going on for months. Some time ago, there was an agreement to proceed with negotiations without a lockout or a strike. The government even appointed mediators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654159">Everything had been going well. There was even some hope that this dispute could be resolved. However, as the months passed, it became clear that things were not looking quite so rosy. Newspapers have reported that the employer unilaterally decided to change shift schedules. The union took that move as a sign of disrespect during the negotiating process. Tensions escalated, and workers started floating the idea of going on strike. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654160">There were snubs from both sides throughout the months, yet the government was nowhere to be seen. Its only contribution was to say that it was thinking of introducing special legislation. It missed the point. The Liberals are constantly boasting about defending workers' rights and repealing some of the laws passed by the Harper government. There may be some truth to what they say, but, at the end of the day, it is just like everything else. The Liberals talk about climate change, but they keep subsidizing oil companies. What is more, they are not doing a thing to address the issue of tax havens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654161">I will get back to the Port of Montreal, but it is still interesting to see that, in the end, it is the same story with workers' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654162">The same thing happened with Aveos workers. Air Canada violated both the terms of the contract and the law when it shut down the aircraft maintenance centre in Montreal. The Liberal Party promised Aveos workers it would support them. What did it do once it came to power? It amended the act in such a way that Air Canada did not have to respect workers. Clearly, the Liberals can be counted on to say one thing and do the opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654163">The urgent matter here is not the Liberals. The urgent matter is finding a solution so the Port of Montreal can keep operating. We know there is a problem. In a perfect world, a work stoppage at the port should not have an impact on Quebec's economy. This is serious. The employer should not be allowed to rest on its laurels because of this special legislation. It should not be allowed to avoid negotiating because it is going to get special legislation that will give it everything it wants. That is not how it works, but the Liberals seem to think that is how it works. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654164">When the Liberals talk, they almost sound like the NDP. When they act, however, they are more like the Conservatives. It is a little hard to figure out how they think. The fact is, we are always disappointed, and that is a shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654165">There was a truce that lasted several months, so the government had time to see what was coming, and yet it did absolutely nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654166">I myself have had discussions with the Port of Montreal. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252775" Type="2">Thérèse-De Blainville</Affiliation> has had discussions with the union. What has the government done? When did the <Affiliation DbId="253379" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation> talk to them? When did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talk to them? For them, the solution is simple. They just wash their hands of it, since special legislation will make sure there is not a single day of strike action. I have to say, that is weak. Everyone agrees that a negotiated agreement is better than one imposed by special legislation. Imposing special legislation is like dictating to them how things are going to go and telling them to just suck it up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654167">I am trying to imagine how the workers will feel the day after this vote, when working conditions are imposed on them. Do members think those workers will feel like going back to work? Do members think the workers will be happy about the situation? Do they think that the Port of Montreal is going to come out the winner in the end?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654168">The way I see it, if workers do not feel like going to work because they do not feel appreciated or respected, then there is a good chance that they will be going in reluctantly and will not be as productive. Generally, after a labour dispute and difficult negotiations, and especially after being told by the government to suck it up, workers may need time to calm down. The situation needs to be defused. The parties need to find a way to open a dialogue and work together. It is impossible to do that when one side is saying that it has all the power and the other has none. The government has a strange way of looking at things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654169">I am also surprised that the government is using the strike argument. It is saying that avoiding a strike is crucial. If workers go on strike, it is the end of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654170">There is no hiding the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, there will clearly be economic repercussions that no one wants. The Port of Montreal, the maritime employers that employ the workers, and business people have all said that the port must not be shut down. The workers never said that they wanted the port to shut down. They said that there would not be a strike if the new shift schedules that were unilaterally imposed during negotiations were rescinded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654171">It makes me wonder. I am not in the shoes of the port workers or the administrators. However, I imagine that if there were no special legislation, I would ask myself if I wanted to shut down my port. I could lose customers if the port shut down, and Quebec would not be in happy. If the government said that it would not pass special legislation, perhaps I would sit down, negotiate and try to keep the port open because I want goods to keep moving. Perhaps that is what would have happened. Perhaps the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the <Affiliation DbId="253379" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation> could have picked up the phone, called the port representatives, the maritime employers and the union members and asked them if there was any way to lower the temperature a little, cool off, step back and for each party to give a little. Instead, the government is siding against the workers, and that is unacceptable. I hope that the workers will remember this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654172">This has happened before. The government has let conflicts escalate. It never seems able to take action or be proactive when issues arise. The conflict with the Wet'suwet'en went on for months, and the government was not even able to speak to them. It did not want to. The Wet'suwet'en were blocking rail lines all over the place, but the federal government claimed it was a provincial jurisdiction and that it did not want to get involved. It was mind-boggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654173">The same thing happened during the CN strike. It took a propane shortage during that labour dispute for the government to wake up and realize that it should maybe facilitate dialogue. It is frustrating when a government does not have its act together and simply gives up. A government's job is to govern, not to constantly impose decisions or take sides. The government's job is to help improve these situations. That takes dialogue and a little moral authority, not just the government's usual heavy-handed approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654174">Today, the Liberals have tabled special legislation, after waiting until negotiations hit a wall. I think that, although we are disappointed, it is not too late. I think the government could still change its mind. It still has a chance to recover its sanity and realize that if we really want a balanced society, that happens through free collective bargaining. A balanced society can only be achieved through dialogue, not through imposing work conditions or through a government taking sides. We need a government that can bring some common sense to all this. That is what I am asking of the government going forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654193">I want to explain the crisis at the Port of Montreal in clear and simple terms. The workers at the Port of Montreal want a collective agreement. That is their right, just as they have the right to negotiate that agreement freely. The Liberal government wants to prevent them from negotiating freely by introducing legislation that will force them back to work. That is the situation, explained in simple terms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654194">Workers have a right. It is a fundamental and essential right that allows them to do their jobs. It is essential that we support them and that we support their right to bargain freely. When the Liberal government, or any other government, prevents these negotiations from taking place, it hurts workers and violates their rights. To create a just society, we must support the process and support free negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654195">What the government is proposing is exactly what former Conservative governments did. It is exactly what this government did with Canada Post workers. We clearly see once again that the Liberal government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> do not stand up for workers' interests. The decision to introduce back-to-work legislation is unfair and wrong and will harm society in general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654196">The Liberals have shown once again that they are no different than the Conservatives and that they are turning their backs on workers to the benefit of businesses. The government will say that is not true, that there is now a crisis and that if workers fight for their rights, that will negatively affect the rest of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654197">However, the workers at the Port of Montreal want to defend their working conditions, not hurt our society. The spokesperson for local 375 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, stated, “We don't want to hurt the Montreal economy. However, we do want to exercise our fundamental right to bargain collectively.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654198">The national president of CUPE wrote to the Prime Minister to tell him that it is impossible to negotiate fairly and in good faith under the threat of back-to-work legislation since such legislation completely destabilizes the balance of power between the parties. The legislation that we are debating will completely destabilize the balance of power between the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654199">Workers are prepared to negotiate. The Liberals need to withdraw their back-to-work legislation and let workers defend their rights at the negotiating table. We are once again asking the government not to intervene and to let the parties freely negotiate in order to come to a better agreement. I repeat: It is their right to do so. It is only through bargaining that employees will be able to obtain safer and fairer working conditions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654200">What is going is very clear. Workers at the Port of Montreal want to negotiate a collective agreement. That is their right. They should be able to do that freely. The Liberals, the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are undermining their ability to freely negotiate. They are undermining the fundamental rights of workers to negotiate their collective agreement. This is absolutely wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654201">Forcing these workers back to work when they are in the midst of a negotiation would completely upset the negotiations. It completely undermines the process. It takes away the rights of the workers to fight for their basic rights. It is the wrong thing to do. It is obviously going to mean that the employer is not going to want to negotiate fairly when an announcement is made that there is going to be back-to-work legislation. What is the motivation for the employer to negotiate in good faith now? It is the wrong thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654202">Workers at the Port of Montreal have been very clear that they do not want to hurt the economy; they just want to negotiate a fair deal. The national president of CUPE wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and made it clear that by putting forward this legislation, it would directly undermine the negotiation and negatively impact the workers' ability to get a fair deal. The workers are ready to negotiate; they are negotiating right now, </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654203">The Liberals must withdraw this legislation. It is the wrong thing to do and it does not help anyone. In fact, the only way there are good conditions for all of Canada when it comes to the work done at ports is when the workers are respected, when they are given the dignity to have the ability to collectively negotiate and when there are free and fair collective agreements. When there are free and fair collective agreements and workers are respected and able to do their jobs, all of Canada benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654204">When workers are undermined and disrespected, it will hurt not just the process and the workers but everyone. It is not a good condition for work when workers are being disrespected like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654205"> Obviously, the New Democrats are opposed to this and are calling on the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to immediately withdraw the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654206">Time and time again, the Liberals say they are the friends of workers. They are doing exactly what the Conservative Party would have done by bringing in back-to-work legislation so early in the negotiation process. It is so wrong to do, and is always wrong to do, but it is particular heinous when they are in the midst of negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654207">I again want to be clear. We are asking the Liberal government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not to intervene in the workers' ability to negotiate and work toward a collective agreement. That is their right and it should be defended and protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654208">We know that when workers are able to freely negotiate their contracts and agreements, they are able to ensure that good protections, good work hours and safety are in place. We want to be leaders in ensuring that we set the precedent that at the federal level, workers are supported and protected and not being forced back to work. The New Democrats again call on the government to withdraw the legislation, to stop its undermining of workers and, instead, to stand up for workers and protect their rights. These are difficult times and in difficult times, we expect the government to stand with workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654209">We have seen the Liberal government again and again side with large corporations. It said no to taxing the ultra-rich, it said no to taxing web giants, it said no to removing profit from long-term care, it said no to changing Revera, the second-largest long-term care home provider in Canada, from a for-profit company and making it public. It continues to show a pattern of behaviour. It said no to universal pharmacare, which, again, it stood up for big pharma. There has again and again been a pattern of behaviour where the Liberal government continues to defend the rights and interests of large and powerful corporations over the interests of people and workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654210"> Enough is enough. The government should withdraw the legislation and let the workers negotiate. They will able to obtain a good contract that is in the best interests of workers and in the best interests of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654226">I remember quite well that the first battle we fought as an NDP team with Jack Layton was on back-to-work legislation for Canada Post, and once again we defended the rights of workers. A Conservative government was in power and it was violating the rights of postal workers. Ten years later, I am still standing in the House defending the rights of workers, which are now being trampled by a Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654227">This is proof positive that, when it comes time to take a stand, the government, whether blue or red, always sides with the employers, the bosses, the richest people in our society. It never sides with ordinary Canadians and with the workers who are just trying to improve their lives, to get by and to pay the bills. They simply want a chance to improve their living and working conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654228">I want to take a moment to remind everyone that social progress does not appear out of thin air. Social progress happens when there are men and women who join forces, organize and take action together, collectively, to change the ground rules and improve society in order to create more respect, justice and equality. This is done through various avenues, including community associations, citizens' groups, the women's movement and the environmental movement. There are a lot of things going on in our society, and there have been for a long time. There is also the labour movement, and we have come a long way in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654229">Unions were illegal in Canada until 1872. It was not just difficult to unionize. It was illegal. Workers had to fight for their rights and to improve their working conditions. They had to fight to go from poverty and exploitation to a situation where they were able to earn a decent living, support their families and have some hope for the future by building a legacy that would help their children to have a better life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654230">Labour laws and laws governing minimum wage, labour contracts and collective agreements did not appear out of thin air. People got together and said that enough was enough. They decided that they were going to use pressure tactics to fight for better working conditions. Overall, it has worked fairly well. If we compare 19th century working conditions with those of today, it is clear that progress has been made. Much of that progress comes from workers obtaining the right and the option to use pressure tactics and to make demands to improve their situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654231">I have been saying this for years, and I will say it again. The Liberals say they are standing up for the middle class and those seeking to join it, but I would remind the Liberal government that much of the middle class owes its existence to the labour movement in our society. Broadly speaking, the middle class and the creation of unions, be it in municipalities, public services or private enterprise, go hand in hand. People fought to bring about what is essentially a middle class whose members can afford to buy a house, to buy a car, an electric one, ideally, and to go on vacation when travel is allowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654232">Over time, the bargaining process has been fine-tuned. There have been ups and downs. Some years have been good for unions, others not so much. That is all part of the balance of power, but attempts have been made to create rules that are good for everyone, that level the playing field at the bargaining table and establish a framework for relationships that can sometimes be tense and adversarial, while remaining civilized. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654233">Let us not forget that the union movement and workers relinquished the possibility of triggering a strike at any time, which was a historic concession. Now there is a process to be followed, notices to be given, laws to be obeyed and so forth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654234">In the case of the Port of Montreal, this process was meticulously followed and even resulted in a truce that lasted several weeks last year. The workers wanted to defend their working conditions—especially their schedules, which I will come back to—and did so by following the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654235">Once again, the Liberal government is using a bazooka or a sledgehammer to deprive workers at the Port of Montreal of their bargaining power. I find that mind-boggling. All last week, union leaders said that if the port authority stopped meddling with their schedules and provided job security, they would not go on strike, they would stop using pressure tactics and they would return to the bargaining table to come up with a freely negotiated solution.<I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654236">Before the unlimited general strike could even be called at the Port of Montreal, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="253379" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation> announced that special legislation would be introduced to force dockworkers back to work in the event of such a strike. The general strike had not even been called, but the government had already sent the employer the message that it could sit idly by and do nothing because, in any case, the government would be there to help, after having tilted the balance of power away from the union and the workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654237">This Liberal government claims to be a friend of workers and of the labour movement of Canada, but every chance it gets, it sides with the employer and upsets the balance at the bargaining table. That balance, however, is a constitutional right, since the Supreme Court in 2015 ruled in a Saskatchewan case that the right to call a strike and use pressure tactics is protected under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654238">Why are the Liberals addicted to special legislation? Why do they attack workers at every opportunity? What is more, the Port of Montreal is doing well. It is not a company that is struggling, that is on the verge of bankruptcy or that is unable to fulfill its obligations. On the contrary, business is booming at the Port of Montreal, and so there is no reason for a labour dispute there. Why does the employer want so much flexibility and the ability to meddle with the work schedules of dockworkers? I do not understand that at all. There is no financial or economic reason to justify it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654239">Speaking of economic impacts, it is clear that pressure tactics have repercussions. That is part of the rules of the game. That is how our labour relations system is built. It enables workers to put pressure on the employer to force the employer back to the bargaining table so that a mutually acceptable compromise can be reached. That is how it works, and usually it works well, when there is no special legislation. The Port of Montreal is profitable. People need to know that and it needs to be said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654240">The other important thing that I found particularly inappropriate was the misinformation being spread by the Minister of Labour. She says the government is worried. She says port operations must continue because we are in the midst of a pandemic and medicines and public health are important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654241">Whenever there were labour disputes in the past, the dock workers' union has always made it very clear that medical supplies, goods destined for hospitals and items used to care for people would be unloaded and transferred even during an unlimited general strike. I think that is worth saying again and again, because people need to know that the strike will in no way jeopardize public health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654242">The Liberals are once again giving a huge advantage to management. Lucky thing both parties are still at the bargaining table. Let us hope that a solution will be negotiated before this devastating bill is passed in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654243">Again we are seeing the Liberals and Conservatives walking hand in hand when it comes to violating the union rights of workers. In fact, and I think my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252973" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> mentioned it, the use of such draconian parliamentary or legislative tools could spoil labour relations at the Port of Montreal for years to come. The Liberal government will bear some responsibility for that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654269">Mr. Speaker, the Port of Montreal is vital to the economies of both Canada and Quebec. It is the main point of entry for goods and materials that Canadians and businesses depend on, especially in Quebec and Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654270">A partial work stoppage began at the Port of Montreal on April 13. On April 26, it became a full work stoppage. The Port of Montreal is the second-largest container port in Canada. Every year it handles over 1.6 million 20-foot containers and 35 million tonnes of cargo representing $40 billion in goods.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6654271">The current work stoppage is impeding the flow of $270 million per week in cargo through the port. It is also harming the transportation industry by imposing significant costs on Canadian businesses that use the port, for example through increased transportation costs and lost sales due to import and export delays, and it is affecting the livelihoods of thousands of Canadians whose jobs directly and indirectly depend on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654272">Even before the strike action began, industries and businesses regularly shipping through the port began to make alternative plans. Due to this anxiety in the supply chain, there was a decrease in container volumes at the port worth $30 million per week for the month of March 2021 compared with the previous year. The initial partial work stoppage further reduced port capacity by approximately 30%, representing a loss of cargo volumes worth an estimated $90 million per week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654273">All of this comes at a time when industries are still struggling to recover from major economic disruptions over the past year. It is clear that the effects of this work stoppage, if it continues, would have an enormous impact on the Canadian economy. How did this happen? How do we find ourselves in these circumstances? Let me take a few minutes to explain how it came to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654274">The employers here are represented by the Maritime Employers Association, or MEA. The MEA is a voluntary employers' association representing all maritime employers, including terminal operators, stevedoring companies and ship owners operating at the Port of Montreal. The MEA has the exclusive right to bargain on behalf of those employers in negotiations with the Syndicat des Débardeurs, also known as CUPE Local 375. CUPE Local 375 represents approximately 1,100 longshore workers. These workers are responsible for the loading and unloading of vessels and other related work at the Port of Montreal. Needless to say, their work is vital to the smooth operation of the port.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6654275">First of all, it is important to point out that the last collective agreement between the Maritime Employers Association and CUPE 375 expired on December 31, 2018. The two parties began negotiations to renew the collective agreement in September 2018, nearly four months before it expired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654276">The federal mediation and conciliation service has been working closely with the parties since October 2018. On October 23, 2018, the employer filed an application with the Canada Industrial Relations Board, or CIRB, under subsection 87.4(4) of the Canada Labour Code to determine which activities would need to be maintained in the event of a work stoppage at the port.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654277">Neither of the parties could initiate a work stoppage while the board was considering what services needed to be maintained. Ultimately, the CIRB found that the parties did not have to maintain any activities in the event of a work stoppage beyond their statutory obligation under the Canada Labour Code to continue service to grain vessels. However, the CIRB did acknowledge the union's commitment to continue servicing two vessels that supply Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654278"> The parties were legally entitled to begin a strike or lockout as of the date of the decision, provided they gave 72-hour notice. That is exactly what happened. Four work stoppages occurred in the summer of 2020, each greater in duration and impact than the last. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654279"> An unlimited general strike finally began on August 10, 2020. There was also increasing tension at the port. On August 13, 2020, eight people were arrested and charged with intimidation, mischief and assault following a confrontation between union members and managers who were replacing workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654280">Eleven days later, on August 21, 2020, the parties agreed of their own accord to a seven-month truce during which they would keep bargaining and end work stoppages. That truce ended on March 21, 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654281">Throughout that time, the parties continued to receive intense mediation support from federal mediators. On February 4, 2021, two veteran federal negotiators were assigned to help with negotiations.</ParaText>

Our world-leading scientists and researchers and our outstanding students and research institutions deserve a dedicated voice in Parliament. That means a permanent standing committee on science and research beginning in the 44th Parliament. Not only is this long overdue, but it is critically important to building the future Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654324">Motion No. 38 seeks to create a standing committee on science and research in the 44th Parliament and parliaments going forward. This really matters because science has never been more important in our country's history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654325"> This has been an unprecedented year for people and the planet. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives worldwide, and the climate emergency continues with record heat, devastating storms, wildfires and worsening droughts and floods. It is science that will bring the pandemic to an end. It is science and research that will fuel our restart. It is science that will charge our economic recovery. We must turn the recovery from the pandemic into a real opportunity to build a better future, a future driven by knowledge forged by curiosity and a quest for understanding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654326">To achieve this shared goal, all governments need reliable and solid science. They need strong collaboration with academia and scientific and research institutions to make evidence-based decisions that can tackle the greatest challenges of our time. In 2021, science will remain our most powerful tool in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654327">Let me be clear: Science and research have always mattered, and they will matter more than ever beyond the pandemic. Science holds real promise for people, society and our planet. Science impacts each of our lives. We must pay attention to it. That means valuing both the method and the results. We must foster children's natural-born curiosity through elementary school, high school and beyond, and we should inspire children and young people to wonder; to question; to ask why, what if and how; to build; to design; and to invent. They will be the future of science and the future of a society that respects and values the products of science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654328">Science saves lives through antibiotics, cancer drugs and vaccines, and through improved public health practices, such as masking and physical distancing, to prevent the spread of diseases like COVID-19. Science powers the solutions that make life easier, such as electricity, cars, computers, the Internet and cellphones. It helps us understand the mysteries of our universe, the world around us and our role in it. Science improves education and quality of life, and indeed extends and saves life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654329">Science and research also matter for their own sake. Research is about discovery, not just about solving human problems and developing new technologies. The reality is that science changes the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654330">Canada has tremendous researchers and inspiring students who deserve to be formally heard about being better prepared for a future pandemic, about breakthroughs in science and technology that create powerful new solutions to address climate change, about the long-term health of science and research in our country, about ensuring that the benefits of science are fully shared across Canada and among all Canadians and about the challenges they face as scientists, researchers and students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654331">We are a country of discoverers, inventors and innovators. We have a long history of scientific achievement, including standard time, insulin, infant pablum, pacemakers, stem cells, canola, Canadarm, double lung transplants and smart phone deep learning, just to name a few Canadian achievements. During the pandemic, our scientists at, for example, the University Health Network in Toronto or at the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization are continuing to do the critical work to protect the health and safety of Canadians. We should all be proud of our researchers' incredible achievements, and their work should be a source of immense national pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654332">Although Canada has world-leading researchers and a long history of tremendous scientific accomplishments, the House of Commons lacks a dedicated standing committee on science and research. According to the Library of Parliament, there have been five House of Commons standing committees with either science or research in their titles, and science has been combined with such subject areas as industry and energy, industry and technology, and regional and northern development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654333">The United Kingdom has a science and technology committee to ensure that government policies and decision-making are based on solid scientific evidence and advice. They are reaping the benefits of this structure and focus. The United States has the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology. In its early years, the committee was an important partner in the Apollo program that led to the first person landing on the moon. It strengthens science, education and research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654334">Let us think of what it took for astronaut Neil Armstrong to take the first step on the moon in 1969. Katherine Johnson had to calculate rocket trajectories. Engineers had to figure out how to escape earth's gravity. Supercomputers, which filled whole buildings, had to be scaled down. Spacesuits, helmets, gloves and oxygen-supplying backpacks all had to be developed. The lunar module had to be designed and developed. Nothing existed. Everything had to be imagined, designed and built from scratch. These inventions led to brand new sectors in today's economy. That is the transformative power of strong committee-backed science. Let us imagine the benefit to Canada of a strong dedicated committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654335">Over the past 50 years, it has been rare for Canada's Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology or its predecessor committees to produce a substantive science report. In fact, a very broad reading of the data shows only 12 substantive reports over the last 54 years. Even in the last Parliament, only two of 27 reports by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, or INDU, were linked to science and research. That is about 7%. The point is that the INDU committee rarely talks about science and research, yet they are so fundamentally important to addressing the pandemic, the climate emergency and our future. We will not create the future we imagine without science having a strong and ever-present voice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654336">If anyone is wondering why we lag behind other comparator nations in terms of the profile for science, this is surely an important reason. Our Parliament does not have a dedicated mechanism that encourages anyone to focus on science and research. We need to be better stewards of knowledge and the options it gives us.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654337">The point is that science and research have largely been ignored, unexplored and merely tacked on to the House of Commons parliamentary committees in Canada. In fact, there has been no review of federal science funding in Canada for over 40 years until I commissioned the fundamental science review. Can anyone imagine any other sector having such little attention from and oversight by parliamentarians, all while playing such an important role in driving innovation, economic growth and a better quality of life for all Canadians? Science and research, if nurtured wisely, will be central to how we build the future that Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654338">This lack of oversight over science and research hurts us. If we want Canada to be the scientific and research powerhouse we have the tremendous wealth of talent to be, we need a standing committee focused on the long-term health of science and research in our country. By voting for this motion, we have a chance to acknowledge our responsibility to protect science and research and anchor them in one of our most important democratic institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654339">Science and research should have a permanent place where issues that are important to the research community, Canadians and the future of the country can be studied. There should be a place where scientists, researchers and parliamentarians can come to know one another; where parliamentarians can get a better understanding of science and research; where parliamentarians can learn about Canada's research strengths in such areas as artificial intelligence and deep learning, immunotherapy, nanotech, next generation genomics, personalized medicine, quantum computing and science; where parliamentarians can learn about what is needed to make improvements with real benefits for Canadians. It is time for scientists, researchers and students to be given the key to the people's House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654340">Imagine if the science and research committee had existed at the start of the pandemic. Parliamentarians could have heard directly from the chief science advisor and departmental chief scientists, or whomever else parliamentarians thought they needed to hear from. They could have heard the best scientific evidence on the virus, the pandemic, protective measures and what was needed to mobilize the scientific and research community. After all, science is our best way through and out of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654341">I should mention that we are all very grateful for the tireless work of government scientists, academic researchers and all those who provided scientific advice to all levels of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654342">Science is not a club. It is not for a select few. Science is for everyone. Canadians should have better access to the science and research they fund because science and research provide our best hope for solutions to improving health, addressing the climate crisis, jump-starting economic growth and growing jobs.

              <ParaText id="6654362"> Madam Speaker, I want to start by offering congratulations to my colleague, my hon. friend the <Affiliation DbId="252543" Type="2">deputy House leader</Affiliation>, for putting forward Motion No. 38. She occupies the post of deputy House leader, which I occupied for the nine-year period between 2006 and 2015. Today, I will be drawing a little upon that experience in my comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654363">My hon. colleague's long history of scientific research is well documented. As evidence of the timeliness of her concern, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that it was nearly 20 years ago that she published her book, <I>Hunting the 1918 Flu</I>, warning that we might need to prepare for the next time a similarly deadly virus stalked the globe. That turned out to be a very prescient book indeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654364">Motion No. 38 would amend the Standing Orders to create a new House standing committee on science and research, which would take effect permanently at the beginning of the 44th Parliament. Specifically, Motion No. 38 would amend Standing Order 104(2), which lists the standing committees, or permanent committees, of the House. It would add a 25th committee to the list of 24 committees already therein.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654365">In principle, I support the creation of such a committee, and the real question is why none has ever existed thus far, given the importance of the subject matter. However, my remarks today focus not on the merits of the committee itself, but on the merits of creating this change to the Standing Orders with a simple majority vote in the House of Commons. I want to focus not on the merits of the substance of Motion No. 38, but on the merits of the process being used to change the Standing Orders with the adoption by means of a simple majority vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654366">At first glance one might ask how else do we get from here to there if what is needed is a change to the Standing Orders. In a sense, this is true. We cannot have a new committee without changing the Standing Orders, and we cannot change the Standing Orders without having a vote on which majority rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654367">The other side of the issue is that there is a higher standard. In addition to the formal rule that Standing Orders are to be changed by means of a simple majority vote, a convention in the process of developing is that these rules should not be changed except by the consent of the House leadership of all the recognized parties. This is not quite the same thing as requiring unanimous consent, but it is in the same neighbourhood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654368">It may well be true that the proposed changes to the Standing Orders contemplated in Motion No. 38 should be treated as an exception to this convention, but if so, it is necessary for us to carefully distinguish how Motion No. 38 is different in nature from other proposed changes that have required all-party consent, and therefore how Motion No. 38 may be properly distinguished from the practice laid out in the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654369">I am drawing upon the term “distinguished” from the law. A court may find itself dealing with a case that shares many features with some prior case or a set of cases. The precedence established in those prior cases ought, under normal circumstances, to apply to the case then being considered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654370">However, it may be that the court concludes that there are materially different facts between the present case and the ones that had previously been considered. If so, the court makes it clear that the legal reasoning used in the preceding case does not apply to the present one, and the court forms its new ruling around a different set of reasonings, which appear to the court to be more appropriate to the current circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654371">I will return to whether or not Motion No. 38 may or may not be properly distinguished from the general run of proposed amendments to the Standing Orders. However, first, I need to explain the reason why so many of us in this place take the need for all-party consent so seriously when Standing Order changes are being contemplated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654372">A number of changes to the Standing Orders that have in recent years either been contemplated or actually implemented have had the potential to change the power relations between the players in the House. Sometimes the decision has been for the rules to go into effect immediately, with the clear goal of increasing the ability of the government to control the legislative agenda or to strip away the power of the opposition to delay or challenge legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654373">There have been notable occasions on which the current government has been willing to move forward using its majority as a lever to change the Standing Orders without all-party consensus. My party and I have fought against this with all our might, and I am very proud of our record in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654374">In March 1, 2017, the government proposed sweeping changes to the Standing Orders, which would have had the effect of altering the balance of power in the House. This was done by way of a government motion at the procedure and House affairs committee, to endorse a pre-written discussion paper, implementing a set of changes that would have greatly limited the procedural tools at the disposal of opposition parties.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654375"> The government's plan was to use its majority on the Procedure and House Affairs Committee that caused the proposals in the [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] paper to be endorsed in a party-line vote at that committee and then have the House vote concurrence [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] in the committee's report. My response, as the lead member of the Conservative Party on the committee, was to propose an amendment to the motion and then, with the capable assistance of some other [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] MPs, debate the motion in a de facto filibuster [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>]. This remains the longest filibuster in Canadian history and makes the point that there are many here who believe deeply that any change to the Standing Orders that alters the power relations between [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] parties or, for that matter, any other set of power arrangements within the House of Commons, including those between party leaders and backbenchers, ought to be decided by means of all-party consensus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654376">In a minority government such as the present one, the use of force majeure is not [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] in the same way. In the present Parliament, we have seen more widespread use of all-party consensus [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] than was the case in the past. The mechanism seeking all-party consent has been used for [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] the numerous temporary adjustments to the Standing Orders adopted in the course of the 43rd Parliament that allow us to meet in a hybrid fashion, to alter the seating plan for reasons of personal safety and to suspend the [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>], among other things. These changes have all been negotiated by the House leaders of the various [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] behind closed doors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654377">I do not know how things work in the other parties, but in the case of my party, the House leader [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] have explained to our caucus at our regular caucus meetings what changes were being contemplated and have tried to ensure [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] change to the relevant Standing Orders take place without a mandate in the form of an internal party caucus [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>]. This has made the negotiations slower than might have seemed ideal, but the arrangements that we have developed [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] more inclusive than what existed at the start of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654378">A similar process was [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] used in the 42nd Parliament to deal with my own proposal to amend the Standing Orders so as to elect the Speaker by preferential [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>]. I mention this in part to make the point that the emerging consensus of all-party consent [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] that precedes a change of government. A convention is not truly a convention until it has survived a change [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] and continues to operate now that all players have changed their positions. The committee [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] my proposed motion, and its report neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal. It was really a way of communicating to the House the committee's view that each party ought to allow its own members a free vote on that proposed change to the Standing Orders. A free vote followed. Some members of each party voted against, some [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] and the result was a change. The point is that the process itself was the product of a [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>].</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654379">The purpose of the foregoing comments has been to clearly articulate the emerging convention regarding the requirement to seek and obtain the consent of all [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] in the Commons before making changes to the Standing Orders. To allow an apparent exception to this rule [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] articulating why this particular case is different and why it is permissible to move forward on a simple up-down [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] would have the effect of weakening that convention by showing a willingness to casually set it aside. What is needed, and what I hope I am providing here, is a clear distinction between motions that [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] to amend the Standing Orders in ways that affect power relations and those that do not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654380">I turn to the final presentation. It is my view that Motion No. 38 may be properly distinguished from the kinds of [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] amendments to the Standing Orders that have given rise to the convention. Motion No. 38 is materially very [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] from the kinds of proposed amendments to the Standing Orders that have given rise to the convention. It does not change [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] the House of Commons operates and it does not alter power arrangements among the various players in the House. For example, it does [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] the number of members at the standing committees, it does not change how members are selected for those committees or how the committees [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] or how chairs and vice-chairs are elected, including for the new committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654381">Additionally, Motion No. 38 [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] into effect during the life of the current Parliament, which means we cannot be certain which party will be in power and which ones will be in opposition, the placing of a Rawlsian veil of ignorance between ourselves and the answer to [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>]: Who will be in a position to populate this committee, and will the governing party have a majority on the committee or [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>]? The Rawlsian veil of ignorance that exists helps to ensure that this change to the Standing Orders does [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] predictably shift power in one direction or another. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654382">For this reason, I state confidently that I support Motion No. 38, and also that my commitment remains to the emerging convention of all-party consensus with regard to any changes that would have the potential [<I>Technical difficulty—Editor</I>] power relations between the government—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654392">Madam Speaker, I was saying that Motion No. 38 moved by my colleague from Etobicoke North was important. I do not entirely agree with her that we missed opportunities to talk about science and research over the past year. Particularly in the context of COVID-19, there were several studies that raised these issues. However, I do see that we are having a hard time scheduling the many topics and witnesses we are interested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654393">In that sense, creating a committee devoted to science and research could be very useful. The Bloc Québécois might serve as an example. I am the critic for matters related to the regional economy, industry, entrepreneurship and access to high-speed Internet, but my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252567" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation> is responsible for research and science. We share the work and team up quite a bit on all manner of topics, including vaccines, research, Synchronex, college centres for technology transfer, and the Industrial Waste Technology Centre. Our meetings with the academic community also allow us to reflect on how to do research and work as a team.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654394">Regardless of whether this science and research committee is created, science, research and development will always be matters that I will raise at the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, even if the research aspect is removed. I believe that building an industry requires research and development, and that is why it is important to invest in these sectors. I want to point out that I see a definite increase in the industry department's interest in investing in science since the change in ministers. It may be a coincidence, but we can sense that there is greater interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654395">Motion No. 38 proposes to split the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in two effective from the beginning of the next Parliament. A new standing committee on science and research would study all matters relating to science and research, including any reports of the chief science advisor, and a new standing committee on industry and technology would address the rest of the topics studied by the current committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654396">At first glance, the Bloc Québécois likes this motion. It is in line with the high priority that the Bloc Québécois attaches to science and research. The member for <Affiliation DbId="252567" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation> is our critic for that file. The new committee will provide a scientific platform for the chief science advisor and will enable parliamentarians to access the best advice from government scientists. The committee will also protect them from any governments that are anti-science. The motion also lays out, quite broadly, the matters the committee will consider, which will look a bit like the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology's mandate. All those aspects look good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654397">I would also like to mention our COVID-19 recovery plan, which we tabled in September. The word “research” appears in that document 17 times. It is truly fundamental. When we talk about taking action, we do it through research. It is the same thing for our budget requests. We were very clear: investing in research and development, in Quebec's research centres, particularly those in the regions, and in colleges and universities will help us better support our SMEs. The co-operative work being done in that regard is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654398">Motion No. 38 will provide a platform for our chief science advisor and alleviate the workload of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, but the committee can still count on me to continue to make connections between science and research and industrial development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654399">However, the Bloc Québécois would like to share a few caveats. A science and research committee must not be used as a pretext for interfering in scientific work, which must be kept at arm's length from the policy process. In many cases, basic research is done in universities, and maintaining the independence of universities is absolutely essential. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654400">Splitting the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology should not create a silo where research and science are isolated from the rest of society. During the committee's study of vaccine manufacturing, we saw that basic research, applied research, pre-market evaluation, meaning clinical trials, and vaccine manufacturing are all links in the same chain. We would not want one committee studying the first steps and another studying the rest without communicating with one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654401">A good policy has to cover and support all stages of production, or it is doomed to fail. Perhaps a science and research subcommittee that studies the scientific aspects and then reports to the Committee on Industry, Science and Technology with a broader vision of the applications and consequences would provide insight on that, but that is not what we are talking about right now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654402">We would be very happy if the member who moved Motion No. 38 is open to such a change. We plan to follow the debate closely, in the hope that the member has heard our concerns and is willing to be flexible and open to these good ideas. I reiterate that we support the idea behind the motion. We will likely support the motion even if it is not amended. I believe it is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654403">This was mentioned briefly, but I would like to talk about the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and its mandate. This committee may be one of the most underestimated House committees. The committee studies topics such as business assistance, industrial policy, regional development, scientific research, domestic trade, competition, the effective operation of the marketplace, telecommunications, the functioning of federally regulated businesses, and tourism. That is a lot, and we realize that. Science can get lost in the fray.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654404">Since the fall, the committee has undertaken studies on several topics: mobile and Internet coverage in the regions, which obviously involves a scientific component; vaccine manufacturing and research; the aerospace industry; foreign investment; the Canada Investment Act, which we discussed briefly in the House of Commons today; regulations that affect businesses; and the acquisition of Shaw by Rogers. Our scrutiny of our institutions is always productive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654405">However, we have to acknowledge that the list of topics that the committee turned down is even longer. Nearly every economic sector wanted the committee to address their specific circumstances. The committee was only able to study a few aspects, including the economic aspects of the so-called green recovery, which might turn out to be quite the opposite. In fact, that is the topic we are examining right now. Personally, I want the academic community to be present, and I plan to invite academics as witnesses to add the research and science aspect to our economic recovery. Then there is regional development, something the Bloc Québécois is interested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654406">Except for the study of vaccine manufacturing capacity, which included scientific research, the industry committee did not really discuss science per se. We need to acknowledge that as well. Research comes up much more frequently than science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654407">Splitting the committee in two and assigning the topics of science and research to a new committee could help reduce the committee's backlog. It is a good idea at first glance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654408">However, it is important to support research. In the interest of taking a more scientific approach, I will give some statistics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654409">In Canada, Quebec alone accounts for 40% of exports with a high research and development component. Conversely, Canada is one of the OECD countries with the lowest research and development intensity, which means that our economy is not very innovative. It would be important for this initiative to improve this state of affairs, though not at the expense of the provinces and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654410">The societies that that rely on a green economy and innovation will have sustainable prosperity. We must ramp up scientific research and development. If creating a science and research committee does that, we will come out ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654411">The federal government supports research in different ways: through the research it conducts itself, through the research grants it provides, through the granting agencies, through the work of the National Research Council's research centres, through its industrial policy, and through the support it provides for research and development activities, especially those carried out by businesses. All these activities are important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654412">As we saw in our work on vaccines, scientific innovation is a chain in which every link is important. It begins with basic research on structure and molecules. I think it is important to mention this. If we split this up, we might lose certain aspects. Applied research allows us to reproduce the vaccines that come out of clinical trials. One witness even talked about research being translational, because it allows us to go from one stage to the next, from discovery to production. This brings us to the final step, namely production based on the scientific research. If a link is missing, the vaccine will not see the light of day. It is therefore important to see the big picture, to support research and innovation at every stage and to approach government programs accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654413">I will close with a final point on two principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654414">We must ensure equity, whether in the aerospace sector, artificial intelligence, information technology or transportation components. Quebec accounts for 40% of Canadian exports, as I mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654415">Canada is much less innovative because its economy relies on foreign subsidiaries. Federal policy is designed to compensate for Canada's backward thinking rather than support Quebec's advanced thinking, which is taking the world by storm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654416">There are also 100 NRC research centres, including 50 centres in Ontario compared to nine in Quebec. Quebec is responsible for 40% of technology exports, and yet it has only 9% of federal research centres. It goes without saying that we are concerned. The same is true for super clusters—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6654421">Madam Speaker, I am happy to speak to Motion No. 38 today, which has been brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252543" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation>. It calls for the creation of a new standing committee in the House of Commons, the science and research committee. I know the strong interest and deep concern that the member has for science and research. She is a scientist herself, and I had the pleasure of accompanying her to a G7 meeting on science in Italy when she was Canada's minister of science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654422">Science is important. Its impacts are pervasive in society, from cellphones to sewage treatments, from vaccines to velcro and from athletics to architecture. It is everywhere. Sometimes I think we forget that it is there, like not seeing the forest for the trees. We forget how much we depend on it for everything. Society in general takes it for granted, and politicians take it for granted too. In recent years, we have been seeing a steady rise in disinformation, especially on social media, about climate, the pandemic and vaccines. There is clearly a place for more support to science so that it can give us the facts on a myriad of subjects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654423">I am very pleased to see this motion before us today, and I am very pleased to say that I fully support it and the NDP will be supporting it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654424">Right now, when issues centred on science come to the House of Commons, they are studied in the industry committee, and because of that, the very few studies the committee undertakes that are directly related to science are focused on how science can directly help industry. I would like to emphasize that even though science is such an important topic, we almost never study it directly in any committee here. There is nothing that talks about what the federal government can do to stimulate basic science, nothing that talks about how we can make participation in science more inclusive and nothing that talks about how we could better use science in our policy development. I could go on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654425">For full disclosure, I come from a science background as well. I am a biologist. I worked at the University of B.C. for 17 years or so, and after that I was a consultant for 20 years before ending up here as an MP. I entered politics because I felt that we needed more scientific voices in Parliament. That feeling was especially strong during the last Conservative government, the Harper years. I personally saw my colleagues who worked as scientists in the federal civil service being muzzled and not allowed to speak about their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654426"> I remember one big webinar in 2012, a global webinar before COVID made that a cool thing, about a report on the state of Canada's birds. This groundbreaking report had been written almost entirely by two brilliant Environment Canada scientists using data gathered from thousands of volunteer citizen scientists. I was working for Bird Studies Canada at the time and helped design, promote and operate those continent-wide data-gathering programs. At the webinar, the two federal scientists were allowed to give a short prevetted overview of the findings on the population trends of hundreds of bird species, and then the government media person opened it up to questions, pointing out that the authors would not be allowed to answer those questions. I had to step in and field media questions even though I had not done the analyses or written the report. It was ridiculous, and there are many more examples of that sort of situation with government scientists not being allowed to explain the findings of their research. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654427">There was also the infamous case of DFO research libraries being closed and their books being thrown into dumpsters. One of my former colleagues, Dr. Jeff Hutchings, a fisheries biologist from Dalhousie University, wrote an important paper on the ecology of the northern cod in 1993. A lot of the information he used came from grey literature survey reports that he found in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans library in St. John's. He found them by looking at every report on the shelf in that part of the library. The Harper government claimed that all those reports were digitized before being thrown out, but it is clear that they were not. Dr. Hutchings tells me that he could not write that report today. That important historical information has been lost and cannot be found in any PDF.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654428">I am happy to say that I think things have improved somewhat and that the present government takes science more seriously than the previous government did. I will point out that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252543" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation> created the chief science advisor position, whose mandate it is to advise cabinet on scientific matters. That is a step in the right direction, but what we really need is a truly independent parliamentary science officer, just as we have a Parliamentary Budget Officer. It would be an office that all parliamentarians, MPs and senators, not just the cabinet, could turn to for unbiased scientific advice, just as we can ask the PBO to assess the financial aspects of various programs or proposals. My former colleague Kennedy Stewart, now the mayor of Vancouver, put that proposal forward in previous Parliaments, but unfortunately it was never taken up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6654429">The federal government puts a lot of money directly into science and research, over $4 billion from what I can determine, so it is incumbent upon us in the House to know how that money is spent, how it could perhaps be better used or how it perhaps should be increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654430"> In 2017, the Naylor report on fundamental science was tabled by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252543" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation>. I was then the NDP critic for post-secondary education, and I heard very positive reviews from university representatives. The Naylor report made 10 main recommendations to increase and coordinate funding to basic research. Four years later, only one of those recommendations has been fully completed, six are partially addressed or still in progress and three have not been done at all. Therefore, a study on the implementation of the Naylor report would be very illuminating, just the kind of thing a standing committee on science and research could take on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654431">Another useful study would be one on inclusion in Canada's research sector. I am afraid I am only too typical of the standard Canadian scientist, an older white male. We have been hearing for years how we have to encourage women and girls to enter the sciences. When I taught an ecology course at UBC one or two decades ago, we had a very high proportion of female students, but that was not the situation across the board in other fields of studies such as engineering and physics. That situation has been improving. Many women are entering those fields, but for many years there has also been a systemic bias against women in science and research, and many were frustrated by the lack of success and advancement or in obtaining research grants. Thankfully, even that phenomenon seems to be getting better and the trajectory is definitely toward gender equity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654432">This past year, we have heard a lot and learned a lot from the Black Lives Matter movement and the more general barriers facing racialized people in our society. I have been very inspired by the stories I have seen in the media and online about young Black scientists and indigenous scientists who talk about the struggles they face in a field where no one looks like them. Their persistence and passion for science is really an example for all of us. Therefore, inclusion in science and research is another critical issue that a standing committee could study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654433">To have any intelligent debate, indeed to have a functional democracy, we have to agree among ourselves on basic facts, but often those standard baselines are hard to find.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654434"> In the natural resources committee in the previous Parliament, we did a study on how we should have an independent, unbiased, timely, comprehensive source of energy data in Canada. Some of that was being done by the National Energy Board at the time, but it was anything but comprehensive, timely or unbiased. I felt we should have a completely independent agency similar to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Even a dedicated part of Statistics Canada would be better than what we have now. However, two or three years later, as far as I know, nothing has been accomplished along those lines. Therefore, a dedicated science committee could look at all aspects of public data availability in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654435">I will finish with a quote from Timothy Caulfield from the faculty of law at the University of Alberta. In 2017, he said in The Globe and Mail, “We need more science. We need better science. We need trustworthy science. We need agenda-free science. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654436">The House of Commons in particular and Canada in general would benefit greatly from a standing committee focused on science and research, and I will be supporting this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654437">Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise virtually in the House of Commons today in support of private member's motion, Motion No. 38, brought forward by my great friend and hon. colleague, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="252543" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation>. This motion would create a permanent standing committee on science and research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654438"> I had the pleasure of serving as the parliamentary secretary to science, working alongside the former minister, and I can say that it was the most rewarding time I have had as a member of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654439">Growing up in London, Ontario, I was keenly aware of the amazing research that has been done at Western University over the years. Sir Frederick Banting was working at Western 100 years ago when his research for a lecture inspired his idea that provided the key to discovering insulin. Dr. Vladimir Hachinski, the distinguished professor of neurology at Western, transformed the understanding, diagnosis and prevention of the two greatest threats to the brain: stroke and dementia. Dr. Cal Stiller was Canada's major voice in organ transplantation during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. He championed innovation in health and biomedical research and pioneered multi-organ transplantation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654440">These are just a few of the many laureates that are honoured in Canada's medical hall of fame based in London, and that is not even mentioning some of the stars in the science and research world today, like Ravi Menon, the pioneer in the use of MRI for brain imaging, or the applied research under way at Fanshawe College. Suffice it to say that I think members can understand why I am so passionate about this as a parliamentarian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654441">Being the parliamentary secretary to this important portfolio made me understand the depth of Canada's scientific and research community. What this experience made me realize is that science and research must be celebrated, promoted and supported, and if we have learned anything from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is that science must be respected and believed for all of us to be safe and healthy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654442">It was once said that the good thing about science is that it is true whether or not one believes in it. We must bear this in mind as we are challenged to understand the world we live in. We need guidance and we need knowledge, and as parliamentarians, we need to ask questions of scientists and researchers to find solutions to the problems that confront us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654443">The goal of the minister of science was to unmuzzle scientists, to make them realize that their voices were being heard. I am pleased to say that during my time as PS to science, the government restored respect in the science community and made the largest investment in science research in our country's history. I am not for a second taking any credit for this important step. I was simply at the right place at the right time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654444">As a government, and under the leadership of our minister of science, we delivered in budget 2018 great news for science with the announcement of the largest increase in new funding for fundamental research through the granting councils in Canadian history with an investment of $925 million over five years. We also put money into the Canada Foundation for Innovation to cover the cost of running research labs and buying equipment for the Canada research chairs program to support the country's top professors, money to support fast-breaking research, and investments to collect data on government-funded researchers and to improve equality and diversity in academia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654445">It was apparent then and still is today that science and research play an important part in moving Canada forward, but it does not happen overnight. We need governments that have a long-term vision and that recognize that scientists need long-term support to be successful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654446">We also need to encourage our next generation to choose STEM or STEAM, as it is quite often referred to today. We need to bring young girls and women into the fold and make them believe that their future career choices can be science, technology, engineering and math, and, of course, the arts are important, too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654447">I was especially pleased when it was announced that we were investing $5.9 million over five years to Let's Talk Science, which is located in my riding of London West.

              <ParaText id="6654451">How can we not agree with the motion? By agreeing with it, we need to make sure science and research get the attention they deserve by giving parliamentarians a chance to meet with people in the science community and hear what they have to say. I cannot say this more clearly: At no time in our history have science and research been more important. COVID-19 has done what few natural or people-made disasters have ever done. It has literally and figuratively stopped us in our tracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654452"> I know I am not allowed to use the member's name in the House, so I will refer to her again as the MP for <Affiliation DbId="252543" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation>. Many people are unaware that she was the first scientist to become the minister of science in Canada, and prior to entering politics, she served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization that won the Nobel Prize in 2007. However, it is her work on the influenza pandemic of 1918 that is so interesting, especially in light of COVID-19. She published a book in 2003 about her expedition to uncover the cause of the flu epidemic. The book is entitled <I>Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654453">After 100 years of research, we are still learning. We are learning what works to eradicate viruses like COVID and how to stop them before they spread. We cannot let it happen again. As parliamentarians, it is our responsibility to make sure it does not. It is our responsibility to ask the big questions and challenge the assumptions. This standing committee would give us a venue to do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654454">One of the first decisions the member for <Affiliation DbId="252543" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation> made as the minister of science was to reinstate the position of the government chief science advisor. Dr. Mona Nemer has been working with her G7 counterparts to launch a new global partnership to fight pandemics. Dr. Nemer has had the opportunity to appear before a number of committees, but a stand-alone committee dealing solely with science and research could rely on her expertise on a more regular basis. She could be called upon to navigate some of the challenges we face, including the so-called brain drain, early career research, stem cell research and the ongoing issue of women in research who are not taken seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654455">In 2018, the minister of science drew a line in the sand for universities in this country: Hire more women, people with diverse backgrounds, indigenous people and people with disabilities as Canada research chairs or be prepared to face funding cuts. Some considered this heavy-handed, but it was necessary to move the dial. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654456">Canadian science grows stronger as our research community better reflects the diversity of background, experience and perspective of Canadians themselves. If we are to remain competitive, Canada simply must have more diversity in senior academic roles and in those coveted research chairs. This is but one issue that a permanent standing committee on science and research could take a closer look at and delve into, with witnesses who could tell us first-hand about their experiences and push us as a government to make better public policy and make government science fully available to the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654457">Every day, we are confronted with problems that need scientists and researchers to help solve. It is time for parliamentarians to take a closer look at this and vote in favour of establishing a permanent standing committee on science and research.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654459">Madam Speaker, my constituent, a busker, applied for the Canada recovery benefit. He submitted his annual income tax return for the last two years along with his City of Vancouver street vendor permit as proof of income and employment. CRA did not accept these and wanted to see receipts and bank statements indicating deposits made. It is, in my opinion, unreasonable to expect buskers and street musicians to provide receipts and regular bank deposit for their small amount of cash income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654460">That was almost six months ago and today, I am happy to report that after this intense advocacy, which included a letter to the minister, questions in question period and countless calls to CRA agents, the government finally accepted my constituent's original proof of income documents, which were his income tax returns and the City of Vancouver street vendor permit, as valid proof of employment and income to qualify for the CRB.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654461">I am sharing this in the House of Commons today so that others can be aware of this important win for my constituent. If people are faced with a similar issue, I urge them to contact their member of Parliament to try to get the matter resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654462">As we are talking about CRA, related to CRA, I have written to the government to request an extension of the income tax filing deadline for older adults age 60-plus who receive their guaranteed income supplement. Last year, the federal government publicly announced that seniors receiving GIS would be able to keep their GIS payments, without interruption, if they filed their taxes by October 1, which helped many seniors. I hope the same measures can be taken again this year to support seniors during this ongoing pandemic where we are well into the third wave with new variants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654463">Many GIS recipients face multiple barriers, including language, mobility and technology. That made the navigating of the systems very difficult, if not impossible, without assistance. These seniors rely on community tax clinics and community non-profit groups to assist them in filing their income taxes accurately and in a timely manner. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the barriers to tax filing already experienced by low-income seniors. Many seniors serve in community organizations that rely on volunteers who are also seniors, such as the 411 Seniors' Centre Society in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654464">With the third wave raging on, organizations providing tax filing services for seniors are shutting down their in-person services in accordance to public health guidelines. I have been informed by the organization that it has been serving over 160 seniors per week and has almost 400 more appointments booked for the upcoming weeks. However, due to the need to temporarily shutdown in-person clinics, it will take time for the organization to move its services to remote models.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654465">Even prior to the public health guidelines, both seniors volunteering and clients in need of support have been voicing health and safety concerns over travelling to the clinic in person. Even with services moved to remote and virtual models, there will be many seniors with technology and other barriers who will not be able to access these services in time. Ontario has also announced a four-week, province-wide shutdown and Quebec has announced special lockdowns for select cities and regions, which will no doubt impact community tax clinics in those communities as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654466">From that perspective, I am asking the government to extend the tax timeline for seniors and to ensure that their GIS is not interrupted, especially during this very difficult period. I hope the government can provide this support to seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654467">Madam Speaker, I am very happy to hear of the outcome with regard to the issue faced by one of her residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654468">With respect to the assessment of eligibility for self-employed Canadians who received the Canada emergency response benefit, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canada Revenue Agency deployed seven emergency and economic recovery measures to support Canadians and businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654469"> The Government of Canada announced the CERB on March 25, 2020, and in just 12 short days after the announcement, the CRA began distributing CERB payments to the millions of Canadians who were in need of that support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654470">On April 27, 2020, the CRA also deployed the Canada emergency wage subsidy, otherwise known as CEWS, to eligible businesses as part of the Government of Canada's COVID-19 economic response plan. This emergency measure was designed to help employers who had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to keep workers on their payroll or to bring back previously laid off employees.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6654471"> The CRA has worked very hard to support Canadians, including workers and small or medium-sized businesses, through this very difficult period. It also implemented measures to preserve the integrity of Canada's tax system.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6654472">We must remember that from the outset, the CERB was designed to support employed individuals, contract workers and self-employed persons who were not deemed eligible for employment insurance. For instance, millions of Canadians were able to apply for the CERB online through My Account via an automated telephone line or by calling CRA's toll-free number. Moreover, millions of payments were made to Canadians via either direct deposit or cheque, typically within just 10 days of applying for the benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654473"> The CERB eligibility criteria clearly stated a person had to either earn at least $5,000 in 2019 or over the past 12 months from self-employment income or provincial benefit payments related to maternity or paternity leave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654474">In the first two weeks the CERB was announced, information provided on Canada.ca and by the CRA call centre agents on eligible self-employment income was unclear. The situation may have led some self-employed Canadians to apply in good faith despite being ineligible. However, by late April, clearer information regarding CERB eligibility was posted on Canada.ca and provided to CRA's call centre agents. The Government of Canada and the CRA regretted sincerely that communications regarding the eligibility criteria may not have been clear in the first days after the CERB was launched.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654475">I would also like to point out that the Government of Canada and the CRA's support of self-employed workers does not stop there. Just last month, on February 9, the government announced that self-employed individuals whose net self-employed income was less than $5,000 and who applied for the CERB would not be required to repay the CERB as long as their gross self-employment income was at least $5,000 and they met all other eligibility criteria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654476">That same day, the Government of Canada and the CRA also announced they would provide targeted interest relief to Canadians who received COVID-related income support benefits. Once individuals have filed their 2020 income tax and benefit return, they will not be required to pay interest on any outstanding income tax debt for the 2020 tax year until April 30, 2022.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654477">Madam Speaker, many low-income seniors across Canada depend heavily on their GIS as a core part of their income. Any interruption to this important benefit would cause dire hardships, so I really urge the government to extend the income tax deadline for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654478">Of course, seniors are not the only people experiencing problems with CRA. There is another situation being faced by my constituents, whereby they are not able to get a new T4 tax slip from CRA in time to file their taxes, and the miscalculation on their T4 is a result of the errors made by CRA on CERB payments. In one instance, one of my constituents did not even ask for CERB but received it. She returned that money and now she is being taxed for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654479">This is absolutely outrageous. We need the government to do better, we need CRA to do better and we need to extend the deadline for income tax filing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654482">In collaboration with ESDC, the CRA designed the CERB application process to be attestation based. This is similar to the approach used in tax filing, where individuals attest to information they provide when they file their taxes.

              <ParaText id="6654486">Madam Speaker, a while back, I asked a question about the Liberal government collecting GST on the carbon tax. In my question, I also referenced a constituent, a small business owner, who had already paid over $2,500 in GST on the carbon tax since April 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654487">The answer I received from the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was extremely disappointing. Instead of addressing the actual issue of GST being charged on top of the carbon tax, she started talking about Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which was completely unrelated to the question I posed. Her flippant non-answer was insulting to many Canadians who are struggling to make ends meet while their household bills are increasing. I hope the Liberals will stop and listen to someone other than themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654488">In simple terms, the question was about charging the GST, a federal tax, on the carbon tax, another federal tax, and why top finance officials are saying that they don’t pay it, yet small businesses are paying it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654489">The minister’s non-answer is unfortunately a continuing trend. In September, I submitted an Order Paper question requesting the total amount of GST collected on the carbon tax since January 2017. The response I received was convoluted and did not provide any of the actual numbers requested. Instead, it pointed me to the annual report that was about to be released. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654490">That annual report was also extremely convoluted and did not provide the breakdown of numbers I had asked for, further proving to me that the government is doing everything it can to sweep the fact that it collects GST on the carbon tax under the rug. If Liberals are so proud of the tax regime they have created, why will they not give us the numbers? In my view, they are clearly trying to hide the tax, hoping that if people do not see it, it does not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654491">Perhaps it is because they do not actually understand the numbers themselves. The whole reason I asked this question was because the top finance official who was testifying at committee did not know that GST was charged on top of the carbon tax. He answered “no” when asked the question directly. How are Canadians to trust the government has their best interests at heart when its experts do not even know how its programs work?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654492">The constituent I mentioned also owns a small trucking company that services the oil and gas industry. She has been tracking the amount of GST she has been charged on the carbon tax just for diesel fuel alone, and she has serious concerns about the viability of her business going forward. By the time the carbon tax reaches $170 dollars per tonne in 2030, she may already have had to shut down for good. This is the case for many small business owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654493">That is not what the government wants, is it? Perhaps that is another debate for another time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654494">The fact of the matter is that rural Canadians are being hit hard by the carbon tax and the GST that is being charged on top of it. In Saskatchewan, it is not uncommon to have to drive one or two hours just to attend a doctor’s appointment, something that the urban population typically does not have to consider. Rural Canadians pay for more fuel. In turn, they pay more carbon tax, and in turn, more GST on that carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654495">Another matter to consider is the weather. In Saskatchewan it can get as cold as -50°C in the winter. Heating a home gets expensive, and these costs are then compounded by the carbon tax and the GST that comes with it. Again, these are costs that are unique to those who live in areas such as the Prairies and not those who live in downtown Toronto, where it rarely dips below -10°C. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654496">The last thing that Canadians need right now is more uncertainty about the future, and that includes the amount of taxes they are being charged, not to mention the taxes on those taxes. Contrary to what the Liberals might think, we understand that emissions need to be reduced, but we do not think that it should be done on the backs of small business owners or at the expense of our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654497">We in Saskatchewan are world leaders in carbon capture technology, but we get no credit for it, not to mention the excellent land stewardship of our farmers and ranchers, who also do not get credit—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654499">Madam Speaker, one of the pillars of Canada's work to combat climate change is putting a price on carbon pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654500">A price on carbon provides Canadians with an incentive to make more environmentally sustainable choices and to invest in greener alternatives that create a cleaner economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654501">The federal carbon pollution pricing system has two components: a regulatory system for large industry, known as the output-based pricing system; and a regulatory charge on fossil fuels, otherwise known as a fuel charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654502"> The latter applies in the province of Saskatchewan, which the member for <Affiliation DbId="252530" Type="2">Souris—Moose Mountain</Affiliation> represents. Consumers do not pay the fuel charge directly to the federal government. Furthermore, the direct proceeds from the federal carbon pollution pricing system remain in the province or territory of origin. In the case of Saskatchewan, approximately 90% of direct proceeds from the fuel charge are returned to residents through climate action incentive payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654503"> The remaining fuel charge proceeds are used to support small businesses, schools, universities, municipalities and indigenous groups. Fuel producers and distributors are generally required to pay the fuel charge and, as a result, the price paid by consumers on goods and services would usually have the cost of the fuel charge embedded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654504">With respect to the GST-HST, it is calculated on the final amount charged for a good or service. The general rule that was adopted at the inception of the GST in 1991 is that this final amount includes other taxes, levies and charges that apply to the good or service, and that may be embedded in the final price. This includes the fuel charge as part of the federal carbon pollution pricing system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654505">This long-standing approach to calculating the GST-HST helps to maintain the broad-based nature of the tax and ensures that tax is applied evenly across goods and services consumed in Canada. It also simplifies the vendor's calculation of the amount of tax payable, since the vendor is not required to back out other taxes, levies or charges at the point of sale in order to determine the amount of GST-HST payable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654506">The Government of Canada has been clear that it should not be free to pollute in Canada. However, I want to strongly emphasize that the government is not keeping any direct proceeds from the federal carbon pollution pricing system. I know that all members are concerned about the state of small and medium-sized businesses in Canada right now. To truly support small businesses during this unprecedented time, I urge all members to come together to support the passage of Bill <Document DbId="11003629" Type="3">C-14</Document> so that we can continue to provide targeted and meaningful investments to help Canadians who need them the most.</ParaText>

When we have phenomenal leaders such as Lieutenant-Colonel Eleanor Taylor retiring in disgust, not much more needs to be said. This needs to be fixed now and into the future. The Canadian Armed Forces needs more Lieutenant-Colonel Eleanor Taylors, not fewer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654520">I know the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> himself spent years serving Canada, both as a police officer and in uniform, and I respect him for that, but what I do not respect or am disappointed in is his lack of taking action and coming up with a plan. When a similar question was asked in question period today about what actions are being taken, the response was that the government is giving another $236 million to combat sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces, with the assumption that this is somehow taking real action. I do not accept that. Money is not going to solve the problem. This is not a money solution to stop and root out what is going on when Canadian Forces members are losing trust in the senior leadership, especially the women and men dealing with sexual misconduct and harassment. They need to have faith that when an allegation is brought forward, concrete action is being taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654521">In closing, what I really want to know is what specific plans and actions the government is taking, specifically the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. What are those lessons? I am not talking about the lessons that he has identified. Something we learn in the Canadian Armed Forces is that there is no use identifying the problem. What are the actual lessons we have learned so that we can ensure this never happens again? What has the minister personally learned?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654522">Madam Speaker, I would like start by thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="253104" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> for his military service. He knows, and I believe Canadians know, that our government has always said that we do not tolerate any form of sexual misconduct, harassment, inappropriate behaviour or abuse of power. We want it reported, we want it investigated and we want to support those who are affected by it, but more than anything we want to make sure it stops and does not happen in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654523">No one is above the law, no matter their rank or position. No one should ever interfere with the independence of any investigation. This is essential to achieving just outcomes and it is essential to the integrity of the justice system. Allegations have always been referred to the appropriate authorities. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and this government have always done. This is why we are taking additional steps, as the hon. member mentioned, to ensure that every CAF member feels safe coming forward and has confidence that misconduct and harassment will always be fully investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654524">We recognize the importance of following all appropriate processes when looking into such matters. That is why our government is committed to taking further action to strengthen accountability mechanisms, promote culture change in the military and end the culture of toxic masculinity, as well as to provide a safe space for survivors to report misconduct and access the services they need, including the recent announcements of peer-to-peer support and enhancing the SMRC. We are doing this by listening to the solutions and recommendations of survivors and those with lived experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654525">I, personally, have been very moved by the testimonies we have heard from survivors and those who were impacted, including the one my hon. colleague mentioned. I can tell members that these stories of mostly female, but also male, survivors who have so courageously come forward are making me, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and our government even more determined. We have got to get this right, and that means listening to the people who are impacted and not creating programs that might have unintended consequences, as we have done in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654526">Through budget 2021, we are committing $236 million to eliminate sexual misconduct and gender-based violence in the Canadian Armed Forces. I believe this is going to make a difference. This will expand the reach of the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre, allow for more research and provide online, in-person, peer-to-peer and other supports that the survivors have been asking for.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654527">We are putting the needs of survivors first, since they are at the centre of these cases. Any action that is taken must prioritize and align with their needs and wishes. The reporting process can be a significant source of stress for survivors. That is why there are options for support without triggering a formal investigation. One example is the sexual misconduct response centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6654528">Members of the Canadian Armed Forces make tremendous sacrifices to protect Canadians and, regardless of rank or gender, they have the undeniable right to serve safely.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6654530">What lessons has he personally learned from his failure? He accepted responsibility for failure to investigate or for these allegations to be properly investigated, and now we are at the point where Canadian Armed Forces members, these survivors the <Affiliation DbId="253808" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> alluded to, want to know that senior leadership can be held to account. I do not need talking points. I spent 25 years in the Canadian Armed Forces. I have people reaching out to me and explaining. Here is what I am hearing from the ranks of the Canadian Armed Forces: They do not trust the senior leadership and they do not trust the government to actually hold the people to account. The skepticism that is growing in the ranks is what is going to do long-lasting damage that we need to fix.</ParaText>

In addition to the $236 million that I mentioned in budget 2021, we will have more to announce in the coming days and weeks.
